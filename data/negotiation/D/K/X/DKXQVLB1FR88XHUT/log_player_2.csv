"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is too high. It's worth going through at least a few rounds of negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John for the full $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure I get the product within my budget."
