Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

My reasoning: I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can come to an agreement at a lower price of $95. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly higher than my minimum. I believe there's room for further negotiation to potentially secure a price closer to $100. I'm willing to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's directly in between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's counteroffer ($95). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $105 is still a good profit margin for me while being closer to Bob's potential acceptance range.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** By countering, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at any price and am looking for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is a solid compromise. It's higher than my absolute minimum and provides a good profit margin. While I could potentially try to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's always the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good sale price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
