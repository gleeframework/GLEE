,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $700,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $850,000. Can we meet at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $950,000. This would be a significant investment for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",875000.0,Bob,6,
