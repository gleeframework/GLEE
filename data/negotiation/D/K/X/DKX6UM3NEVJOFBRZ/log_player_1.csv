Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and direct, highlighting the value the product offers to Bob. I'm also leaving room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  By starting high, I aim to secure a higher price, ideally closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  Leaving room for negotiation makes Bob feel involved and incentivizes him to counter-offer, allowing me to gauge his interest.
* **Provide a fallback option:**  I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe there's room for a mutually agreeable price between $700,000 and my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that bridges the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $700,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $900,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to a potential deal.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and express willingness to negotiate. I also emphasize the value of the product to him, reminding him of its potential benefits.

**Strategy:**

* **Show flexibility:** By lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $900,000, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintain profit margin:** While $900,000 is lower than my initial goal, it still allows me to make a significant profit and stay above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Build trust:** Expressing understanding and willingness to compromise can build trust and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $850,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value while still appealing to Bob. I will try to find a compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $950,000. This would be a significant investment for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This price is still lower than my initial offers but higher than Bob's last offer. It's a compromise aimed at finding middle ground.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's previous offer and express willingness to negotiate further. I also emphasize the value the product offers to Bob, reiterating its potential benefits. 

**Strategy:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
*  I've already made significant concessions, and it seems like further negotiation will not result in a price that meets my minimum requirements.

**Decision:**

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures that I receive my desired price and avoid further negotiation with Bob, which might not lead to a favorable outcome."
