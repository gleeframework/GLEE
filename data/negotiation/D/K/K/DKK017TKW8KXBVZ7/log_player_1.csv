""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  While $150 is your minimum, and $80 is Bob's value, aiming for a price around $120 might be a tempting compromise for him.
* **Securing a Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates the price down a little, selling at $120 or close to it still earns you a significant profit over John's offer."
