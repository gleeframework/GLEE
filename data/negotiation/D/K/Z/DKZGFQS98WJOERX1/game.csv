"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $8,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,750 is still too low for me.  To show you my good faith, I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",8250.0,Alice,5,
