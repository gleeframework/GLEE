"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $100? I believe this would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $100 is too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $100 is a bit outside my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose a compromise: how about we aim for $95 for the product? This is still higher than what you've offered, but closer to what we're looking for. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above Bob's budget. It's more worthwhile for Bob to continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price.  He can always choose to buy from John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go his way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $95 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really hoping to stay around $80.  Would you be willing to come down just a bit more?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $85 for the product? I think this is a reasonable compromise considering your budget and the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob is determined to get the product for $80, and there are still rounds left to negotiate. He's better off rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get the product for $80.  Is there any way we can close the deal at that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence. I see your point and am willing to negotiate further. Considering your budget and the value of the product to you, how does $82 sound as the final price for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still committed to getting the product for $80.  While Alice's offer of $82 is very close, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has a few rounds left, and it's worth seeing if he can convince Alice to drop the price to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get the product for $80.   Could you possibly come down just a couple more dollars?  I'm confident that this would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your request. After careful consideration, I'm willing to settle on $81 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for you and the price I initially proposed. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $81 is tempting, Bob is very close to his goal of $80. He has only one round left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept his counteroffer. It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring he gets the product at his target price without further negotiation."
