"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $100? I believe this would be beneficial for both of us.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $100 is a bit outside my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose a compromise: how about we aim for $95 for the product? This is still higher than what you've offered, but closer to what we're looking for. I hope this works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $95 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really hoping to stay around $80.  Would you be willing to come down just a bit more?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $85 for the product? I think this is a reasonable compromise considering your budget and the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get the product for $80.  Is there any way we can close the deal at that price?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your persistence. I see your point and am willing to negotiate further. Considering your budget and the value of the product to you, how does $82 sound as the final price for the product?",82.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get the product for $80.   Could you possibly come down just a couple more dollars?  I'm confident that this would be a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your request. After careful consideration, I'm willing to settle on $81 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for you and the price I initially proposed. I hope this meets your expectations.",81.0,Alice,9,
