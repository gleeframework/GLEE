This offer gives you a good starting point, leaving room to negotiate while still exceeding your minimum price.  Remember, you can always adjust your strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could take the $8,000, it's significantly below my minimum. I will make a counteroffer to try and reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $9,500.  This still leaves a fair amount of room for you to get a great value.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's counteroffers. Accepting his offer allows me to make a profit, and avoids further negotiation."
