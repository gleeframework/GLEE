Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Offering the product at $2,000,000 gives you the potential to earn an extra $500,000 if Bob accepts.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, attempting to justify the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above $1,500,000.  There's a risk he might find this offer too high.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the initial price too steep."
