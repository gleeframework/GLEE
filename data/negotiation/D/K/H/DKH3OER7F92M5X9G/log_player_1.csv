Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you start the negotiation with Bob at a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification for Price:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value tailored to Bob's expertise helps justify the high price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Goal:**  This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects it, you still have the safety net of selling to John at your desired price."
