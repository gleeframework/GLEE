"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I would like to propose a deal where you can purchase it for $9,500. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an excellent opportunity to secure such a valuable item at a slightly discounted rate. I look forward to hearing your response soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming high with her initial offer. While her product is worth $10,000 to you, you know you have a backup option with John at that price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price and open the door for a potential counter-offer."
