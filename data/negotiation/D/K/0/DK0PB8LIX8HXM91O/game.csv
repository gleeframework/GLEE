,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",122.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $122.50 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $118.75. What do you think?",118.75,Bob,4,
