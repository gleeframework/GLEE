Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. Can you consider meeting me halfway?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While a higher price would be ideal, we're running out of time to close the deal with Bob, and his offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer. Accepting $1,750,000 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
