"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
