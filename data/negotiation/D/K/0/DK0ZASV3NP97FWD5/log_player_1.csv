Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $700,000 is a substantial sum, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value.  It's worth exploring a compromise with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price. I could do $750,000 today. That's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round. There's still time to negotiate with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
