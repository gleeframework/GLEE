Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000), we leave room for negotiation and potential profit beyond John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely mentions ""value"" to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the high price, even though his perceived value is lower. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates willingness to negotiate, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While we mention listing the product publicly, we don't explicitly tell Bob about John's guaranteed offer. This keeps a sense of urgency and potential competition.

**Goal:** The ideal outcome is for Bob to accept the initial price or negotiate down to a price still higher than $15,000. If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a backup to secure our minimum desired price."
