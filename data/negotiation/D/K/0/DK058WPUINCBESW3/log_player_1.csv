Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little if he wants, still landing you a good profit. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $120 might scare Bob off. Offering a price closer to the middle shows a willingness to compromise and fosters a sense of fairness.

This strategy balances the risk of losing the sale to John with the potential reward of securing a higher price from Bob."
