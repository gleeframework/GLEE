"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that work for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
