,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $900,000. This represents a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's split the difference and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $950,000 is close, but I need to be firm on this.  Let's make it a clean $975,000, and we have a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
