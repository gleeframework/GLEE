"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer reflecting its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum budget, there's significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start driving the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $900,000. This represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high.  While she's come down,  $1,000,000 is still more than I want to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's split the difference and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $950,000 is close, but I need to be firm on this.  Let's make it a clean $975,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's risky.  If I reject and she counters, I might end up paying more.  Additionally, I've already used several rounds, and time is ticking.  Accepting this offer saves me money and secures the product."
