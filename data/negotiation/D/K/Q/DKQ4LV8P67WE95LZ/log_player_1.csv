Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $145.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $145 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone can encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Ending with a question invites Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and consider:

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** If he offers significantly less than $145, I may reject it and try a counter-counteroffer closer to my initial price.
* **Time:**  If the negotiation drags on, I'll need to weigh the risk of losing Bob as a buyer against the potential for a higher price. If the time feels right, I will move on to John and accept his $150 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  I am aiming for at least $150 for the product. Bob's offer of $130 is significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** While Bob is interested, I have the option to sell to John for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to my initial $145 price, while still being open to negotiation. I'll frame it as a compromise, suggesting a price point that is fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, and it still allows me to get a good value for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $140, which is a compromise between my initial $145 and Bob's offer of $130. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I emphasize that $140 is still a good value for the product, suggesting it's a fair price. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and consider:

* **Acceptance:** If he accepts, I'll sell the product for $140.
* **Rejection & Counteroffer:** If he rejects and makes another counteroffer, I'll need to evaluate whether his offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price or if it's time to move on to John.
* **Time & Value:** I'll also be mindful of the time spent negotiating. If the process is taking too long, I'll need to weigh the potential of a higher price against the risk of losing Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:**  My minimum value for the product is $150.  Bob's final offer of $135 falls below this threshold.
* **Time & Opportunity Cost:**  The negotiation has reached a point where it's likely further counteroffers won't get me closer to my desired price.  I've already spent time negotiating with Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John is willing to pay my minimum price of $150, guaranteeing a successful sale with no further negotiation required.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale. This ensures that I get the best price for my product and minimizes the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob that might ultimately result in a lower sale price or no sale at all."
