"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit and me to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000 for the product. This offer is very close to your initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's try to finalize this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $870,000 for the product. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to close the deal.",870000.0,Alice,5,
