"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than your maximum, it's still above her value. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit and me to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your ideal price. You can try to push for a lower price. Since you have several rounds left and Alice is already showing a willingness to negotiate, there's a good chance you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000 for the product. This offer is very close to your initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $870,000 for the product. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and is clearly showing a willingness to negotiate. At this point, it's becoming more likely that she won't budge further. Accepting her offer at $870,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiations leading to a higher price or a stalemate outweighs the potential benefit of saving an extra $10,000."
