{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm going to lower my price a bit to $115, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. This should hopefully entice Bob to accept the offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

Bob's offer of $105 is above my minimum acceptable price and is closer to my initial asking price. I'll take it!"
