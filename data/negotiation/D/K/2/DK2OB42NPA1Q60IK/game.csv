"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another move. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,500. I can offer it to you for $11,200. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
