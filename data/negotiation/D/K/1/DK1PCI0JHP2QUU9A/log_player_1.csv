Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $1,400,000 is above your minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's some wiggle room for him to counter-offer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It minimizes your risk:** If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

By offering this price, you are maximizing your potential profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of closing the deal with Bob."
