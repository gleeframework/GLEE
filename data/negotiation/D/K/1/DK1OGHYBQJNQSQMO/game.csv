"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be invaluable to you.  After careful consideration, I've determined a fair asking price of $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true value and potential for growth. I'm confident it's a price that will benefit both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  It's a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it unfortunately doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and am prepared to accept $950,000 for the product. This price represents a fair balance between our respective needs, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident that this product will deliver exceptional value, exceeding your expectations. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
