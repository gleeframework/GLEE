Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a strong fallback option (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to push for a higher price with Bob, who values the product significantly more than John.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confident Tone:**  The message starts by emphasizing the product's value, setting a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **High but Justifiable Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than your minimum but still leaves Bob with a $150,000 gain from his perceived value. 
* **No Room for Negotiation (Implied):** By stating a firm price, you signal that you're confident in its fairness and may be less willing to haggle.

**Why this approach could work:**

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:**  You aim to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product.
* **Leverages Your Position:** Your backup offer from John allows you to be bolder. 
* **Clean and Direct:**  This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth, which can be beneficial in high-stakes negotiations.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential reward of a higher sale price often outweighs the risk of going straight to your backup buyer in this scenario."
