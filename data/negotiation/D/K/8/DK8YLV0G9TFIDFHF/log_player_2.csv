"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is below your maximum budget of $10,000. This means you can save $500 by accepting her offer. While you could buy from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to take the better deal from Alice."
