"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have room to negotiate, so it makes sense to counteroffer Alice to see if you can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is better than her previous one, but it's still higher than what I want to pay.  I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if I can bring the price down even more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to pay closer to $11,250, Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. This is a good price for the product, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Alice."
