"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your effort. However, I am looking to keep my investment within $1000000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for a higher price. I will counteroffer Bob to try and close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low. The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the value of your product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.  I have several rounds left and can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,100,000 right now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This gives you a good value, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I believe a fair price for the product would be $1025000. This price respects both the value of your product and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is now very close to my desired price point. While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of further rejection is high. With only 4 rounds left, I'm better off accepting this offer and securing a profitable sale. It's also important to remember that Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, which is a good sign for future potential business."
