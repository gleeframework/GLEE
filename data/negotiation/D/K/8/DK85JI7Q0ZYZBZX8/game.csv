"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1450000. This price allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
