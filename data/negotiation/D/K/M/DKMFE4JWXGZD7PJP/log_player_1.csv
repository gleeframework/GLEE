Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.

Bob is not budging from his $85 offer, and it's unlikely he'll go much higher. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for an uncertain outcome."
