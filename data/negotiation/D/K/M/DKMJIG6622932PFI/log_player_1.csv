"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and leaves me some wiggle room. 
* **Positive Message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've made it clear I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and hopefully get a good price, but I'm also prepared to switch to John if the deal with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation process.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  While I'm trying to get a better deal with Bob, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150 if the negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great price for such a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I've lowered my price to $130, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $130 is still a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm again asking for Bob's opinion to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation.

By continuing to negotiate and demonstrating flexibility, I hope to reach a price that is acceptable for both of us. However, I still have John's offer as a backup if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's offer shows he's still interested and willing to negotiate. There's still potential for a deal, but I need to be firm about my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer Remains Secure:**  I have a secure alternative with John's offer of $150. This gives me leverage during the negotiation and allows me to be less pressured to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my minimum, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price.  I'll also reiterate the product's value to try and convince Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $120, but this is really my final offer. This product is of excellent quality and worth the price. I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm firm about the price but also acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Decision Time:**  I'm setting the stage for a decisive answer from Bob. 

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards accepting a price closer to my minimum. I'm confident that with a little more pressure, we can reach an agreement. However, I still have John's offer as a backup in case the negotiations fail."
