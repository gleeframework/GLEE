{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate.  I'll be ready to counter his offer if he rejects this one, but ultimately, I have John as a backup to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $80. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $78, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum of $80. To guarantee I don't lose out, I'll sell to John for $80."
