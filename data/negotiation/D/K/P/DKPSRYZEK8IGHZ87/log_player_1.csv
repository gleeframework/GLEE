Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,050,000, slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** The offer is not too aggressive, as it only exceeds Bob's valuation by 5%. This makes it more likely he'll consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer with a guaranteed $1,000,000 allows me to confidently negotiate with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I am hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm unwilling to sell for less than $1,000,000, so accepting his offer would be a loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating a potential for reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, but I prefer to try and maximize my earnings through negotiation.

I will proceed with a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go as low as $980,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,015,000? This would allow me to achieve a fair price while still staying within a reasonable range for you."", ""product_price"": 1015000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** The price of $1,015,000 remains above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message highlights the fairness of the offer to both parties, making it more appealing.
* **Keep John in the back of my mind:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, but I'm confident that I can achieve a better outcome through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll try to find a middle ground. Let's aim for $1,005,000. It's slightly higher than my previous offer but lower than your last proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is still slightly below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate may lead to further concessions, potentially dropping below my minimum.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds.
* **John's offer is a guarantee:**  While I'm slightly disappointed in not getting a higher price, John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer acts as a safety net, making accepting Bob's offer a reasonable choice."
