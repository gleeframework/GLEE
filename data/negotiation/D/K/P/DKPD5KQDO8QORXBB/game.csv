"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product holds value for me,  $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
