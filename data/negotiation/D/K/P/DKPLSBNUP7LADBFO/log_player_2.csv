"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. While I'm confident in its value to you, I'm also prepared to sell it to another buyer for $800,000 if you decline this offer. I hope you'll consider this opportunity and let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
