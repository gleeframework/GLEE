,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer it to you for $170. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",170.0,Alice,5,
