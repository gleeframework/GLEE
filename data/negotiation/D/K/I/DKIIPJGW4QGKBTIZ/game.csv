"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go over $90. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
