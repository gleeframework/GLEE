"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $16,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $16,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I can do $13,000, and I believe that's a very competitive offer.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
