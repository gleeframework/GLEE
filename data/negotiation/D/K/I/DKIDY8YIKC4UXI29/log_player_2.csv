Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, which would be $105. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really love the product!

You have three options:

Alice is very unlikely to go below $105.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $100."
