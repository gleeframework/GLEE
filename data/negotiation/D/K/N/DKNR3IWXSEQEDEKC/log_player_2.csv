"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

While Alice is coming down, I think there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer. I'll try another counter-offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Alice is holding firm and this is a good price. It's not worth risking the deal by pushing further and potentially having to go with John's higher price."
