"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  By highlighting the product's value and your confidence in it, you aim to influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price signals that you're open to negotiation but also values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant move towards your desired price, but it's still above his perceived value of the product. You have room to negotiate further, especially since you have 8 rounds left. Selling to John is a guaranteed profit, but there's potential to earn more with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It shows you recognize the value of this product. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession ($150,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above both Bob's valuation and our minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By staying relatively close to our initial offer, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired range. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm not quite there yet. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly.  While his offer is getting closer to acceptable, the increments are small, suggesting he might have more room to negotiate.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have 6 rounds left, giving us time to push for a better price.
* **Alternative Option:** The safety net of selling to John allows us to apply a bit more pressure. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, we'll make a smaller concession to signal that we're nearing our bottom line. We might also hint that John's offer is still on the table to introduce a sense of urgency."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's prepared to offer $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you the first opportunity.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but I need a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline Pressure:** Introducing John's offer and a sense of urgency encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Final Concession (for now):**  We're making a small concession to show we're trying to reach a deal, but we're holding firm closer to our bottom line.
* **Maintaining Value:**  Even while mentioning the lower offer, we're emphasizing that we're prioritizing Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,775,000 and $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield only marginal gains. Bob is unlikely to suddenly agree to a price near $1,800,000, and we risk frustrating him.
* **Acceptable Profit:** While not ideal, $1,725,000 is still a significant profit above Bob's perceived value and a decent return on the product. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows you to reinvest the capital sooner rather than risking further delays with uncertain outcomes."
