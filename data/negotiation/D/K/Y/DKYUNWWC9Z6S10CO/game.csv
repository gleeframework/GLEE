"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but I believe the product has significant upside potential that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the upside potential, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering your original offer was $1,500,000 and you're now at $1,350,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,275,000. This is my final counteroffer.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
