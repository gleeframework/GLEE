Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $91? It's closer to my value, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $88. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my preferred price, it's above my minimum, and it's likely we won't get any closer in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing him and potentially having to sell to John for less."
