"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $600,000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $600,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
