``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum value, aiming to maximize your potential profit.  I chose $18,000 as a starting point to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my original asking price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $15,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to be fair while also ensuring I get a reasonable price for my product."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I value your continued interest and appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However,  $14,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $15,500. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $15500. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $14000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. This negotiation has gone on for a while, and it's clear that Bob and I are too far apart on price. While $14,000 is more than John's offer, it's still not enough to justify continuing the negotiation. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
