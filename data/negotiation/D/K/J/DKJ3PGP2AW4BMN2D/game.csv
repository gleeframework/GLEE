"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $15000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to be fair while also ensuring I get a reasonable price for my product.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your continued interest and appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However,  $14500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $15500. This is my final offer. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $15500. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $14000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,6,
