"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, as I'm sure you recognize. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only offer $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I still believe the product's worth is higher.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as high as I can go. How about we meet at $1,080,000?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
