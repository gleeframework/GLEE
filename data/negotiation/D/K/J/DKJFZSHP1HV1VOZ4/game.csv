"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000.

This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the initial asking price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
