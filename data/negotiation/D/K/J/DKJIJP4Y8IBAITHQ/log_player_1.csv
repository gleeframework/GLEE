Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This gives me a good starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price, and if not, we can start the counteroffer process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that right away. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for him, but I'm still leaving some room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $160.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or the need to sell to John for $150."
