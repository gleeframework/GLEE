"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. However, I believe the product's inherent value warrants a higher price. Would you consider $1,100,000? This seems like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. That's the best I can do.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need a figure that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to finalize the deal at $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,090,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
