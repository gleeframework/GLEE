"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm interested in making a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This figure reflects the significant value this product holds for you and ensures a fair return for me. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair return, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. While your offer is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping for a slightly better return. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product. This reflects a good deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while giving me a reasonable return. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm still at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no lower. I'm not willing to go over my budget.",950000.0,Bob,6,
