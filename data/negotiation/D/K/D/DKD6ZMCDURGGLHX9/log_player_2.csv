Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging much.  While there's a chance you could negotiate a lower price with her, it's becoming increasingly likely that she'll hold firm at a price that's higher than your maximum. It's more efficient and safer to buy from John at $800,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
