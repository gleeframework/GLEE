"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product. However, $11000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that 11000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of 10800. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10800 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10200?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below 11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of 10600. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",10600.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10600 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. How about $10400? This is a small step closer to my goal, and I believe it represents a fair value for the product. ",10400.0,Bob,6,
