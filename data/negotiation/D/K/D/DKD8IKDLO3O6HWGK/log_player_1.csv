Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" subtly emphasizes the potential for Bob to get a good price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a slightly lower price. 
* If the negotiations become unproductive or stall, I'll switch to John who offers my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my desired selling point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, but there's a good chance I can do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* If the negotiations stall or Bob becomes unresponsive, I will switch to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great value for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product to subtly remind Bob of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a slightly lower price. 
* If the negotiations become unproductive or stall, I'll switch to John who offers my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,900? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's close, I need to be firm on my bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price. I'm not desperate for a sale and can walk away if necessary.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** Knowing I have John's offer of $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $13,100.
* If Bob becomes unresponsive or unwilling to budge, I will switch to John and accept his offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12,900, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. How about we settle on $13,000? It's just a small difference from your last offer and would allow me to move forward with the sale. I truly believe this product is worth it to you, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Value Reiteration:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the value in a slightly higher price.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I emphasize my desire to find a price that works for both of us to foster a sense of collaboration.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I will finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully assess the situation. If his next offer is still too low, I will switch to John to secure the guaranteed sale.
* If Bob's offer is closer to my price, I'll consider another counteroffer or accept his offer depending on my assessment of the situation."
