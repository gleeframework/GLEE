"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive message:** I want to maintain a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **$14,000 is a reasonable starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation, and is close to my minimum.
* **Setting expectations:** This message establishes the starting point for negotiation and encourages Bob to respond with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can still negotiate with Bob and try to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to try one more counteroffer before considering John as an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,000? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Offering $12,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive language:** I'm still using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting the benefit for Bob:** I emphasize that $12,000 is a ""good deal"" for him, potentially appealing to his desire to get a good value. 
* **Setting expectations:** This counteroffer clarifies my expectation and gives Bob an opportunity to accept or propose another counteroffer."
