Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $20,000. I know this is a significant purchase, but I truly believe in its value and I wouldn't want you to miss out on this opportunity. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to anchor our price too close to that. Starting high gives us room to negotiate and still stay well above our minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the limited-time nature of the offer, creating a sense of urgency and potential loss if Bob declines. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. His response will tell us if we need to negotiate down, or if he's not interested at all (in which case we have John as a backup). 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We expect some back and forth with Bob, and we can adjust our price accordingly while keeping our minimum of $15,000 in mind."
