Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're really committed to this deal. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $8,750 is simply too low. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice is getting closer to his ideal price, the time is running out and the risk of further negotiation getting him a worse price is higher. Buying from John guarantees the price he wants."
