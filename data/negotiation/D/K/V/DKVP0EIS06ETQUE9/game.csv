"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product,  $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and the market, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the upper end of its value,  $1,400,000 falls short of what I believe it's truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects its significant value while still providing you with a fair deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 remains outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This price reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
