Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product,  $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and the market, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 remains outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This price reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I believe this represents a fair compromise.
