I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer of $1,500,000, but it gives Bob an opportunity to get a good deal if the product is worth more to him.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum desired value."
