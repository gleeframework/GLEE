"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Could you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me, as the product's value is significantly higher.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $750,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
