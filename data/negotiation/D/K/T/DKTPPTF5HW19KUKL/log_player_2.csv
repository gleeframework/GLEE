"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  This is my best price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer or going with John's offer for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. This is my last offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Even though she's lowered the price, it's still $200 more than what John is offering. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If Bob rejects Alice's offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept his counteroffer.  He could end up in a stalemate or even a higher price.
* **Time is limited:** With only a few rounds left, it's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
