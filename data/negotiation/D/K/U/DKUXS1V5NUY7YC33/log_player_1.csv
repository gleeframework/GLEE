Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

Bob is clearly employing a strategy of repeatedly halving his offer. This is unacceptable, and I need to signal that firmly.  I will continue negotiating for now, but moving closer to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't become more reasonable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but continuously halving the offer isn't a productive path.  This product holds significant value, and I need to see that reflected.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but that's my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is not negotiating in good faith.  He is stubbornly adhering to his halving strategy, completely disregarding my position and the value of the product. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
