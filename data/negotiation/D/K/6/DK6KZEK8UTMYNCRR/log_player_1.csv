{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering your potential gains. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves a substantial profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and outlining the potential benefits to Bob. 
* **Strategy:** My aim is to see if I can get close to my minimum price. If Bob rejects, I have the option to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price. Alternatively, if he accepts, I still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $1000000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to try and secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Sell to John:** Right now, selling to John is the safest option, as I'm guaranteed my minimum price. However, I'm willing to risk a lower price to see if I can squeeze a better deal out of Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product and the potential gains you'll realize. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $925,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.
* **Message:**  I'm being firm but polite, reiterating the value of the product and the potential benefits to Bob.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer allows me to explore a potential compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make the most of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  
* **Counteroffer:** I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting his offer.
* **Sell to John:**  Selling to John is still an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 912500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm again emphasizing the need for a fair compromise and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal.
* **Strategy:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John. However, I want to see if this counteroffer is enough to get Bob to accept."
