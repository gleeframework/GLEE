"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900000 is lower than what I initially proposed, it's not quite in line with the product's true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'd be happy to accept $1200000 for the product. This is a substantial reduction from my original offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
