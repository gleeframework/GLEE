Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Gauge Interest:**  A higher initial offer can help gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, I haven't lost anything and can proceed with John."
