Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to the product's value to Bob, hoping to secure a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,400,000 is still below Bob's maximum value, giving him room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and value, which can encourage a positive response. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Room for counteroffer:** I can still counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle.  
* **Avoiding John's offer:** I don't want to settle for John's offer yet. There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next step:** I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original offer. I'll keep in mind that I can always fall back to selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I'm confident this price would be a win for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforce value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly pressuring him to consider a higher price.
* **Mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, appealing to his sense of fairness.

**Next steps:**  I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or finally accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we try $1,325,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk that he'll become less willing to negotiate or that we'll get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is still on the table, it's only slightly lower than Bob's current offer.  

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It's a fair price and minimizes the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price."
