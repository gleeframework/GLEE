"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer will give me some information on Bob's willingness to pay, and will allow me to adjust my strategy accordingly for the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a good price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product highly and is willing to pay more than my minimum. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $10,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, given Bob's willingness to go up from his initial $10,000 offer.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit below what I need. How about we meet at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm staying firm at $11,000 for this round.  It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure the deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
