Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe it would be a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.
