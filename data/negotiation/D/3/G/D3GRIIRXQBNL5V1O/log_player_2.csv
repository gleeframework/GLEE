"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is better than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's split the difference and get this done."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,500 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $10,000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is getting closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate further.  He has the option to buy from John for $8,000, so there's no need to accept anything above that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750. This is a fair compromise considering where we both started. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,900. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $9,900 is still above Bob's target price, and he has a guaranteed alternative with John that meets his budget. It's not worth risking a further rejection and potentially wasting more time in the negotiation."
