"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. Let me know what you think!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1800000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is far too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1500000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1000000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. This offer is fair and gives you a significant advantage.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1300000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
