"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $15000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $12500?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12500 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $11000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $11000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $11500? This would give us both a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
