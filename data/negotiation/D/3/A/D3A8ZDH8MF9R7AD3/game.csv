"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm willing to throw in some extra perks to sweeten the deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $13000?  It's a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $13250? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
