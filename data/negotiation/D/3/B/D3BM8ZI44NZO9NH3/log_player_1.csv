Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000 to demonstrate my desire to work with you.  This represents a significant discount and I believe it's a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1300000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in this product. I'm eager to finalize this deal and hope you'll consider my counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still too high for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $1150000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counter with a price that's a bit closer to my desired price and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  we're getting closer, but $1,150,000 just doesn't work for me.  To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a fair price point that balances both our needs.  I'm confident we can find a resolution at this price."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1175000 is still slightly above my budget. To make this work, I'm offering $1160000. This is a fair price that balances both our needs.  I'm confident we can find a resolution at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000.

While Bob is getting closer, we're running out of time.  I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable price in the remaining rounds.  To ensure I get the value I need, I'm going to sell the product to John."
