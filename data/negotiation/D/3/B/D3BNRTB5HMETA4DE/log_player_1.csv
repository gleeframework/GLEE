Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
