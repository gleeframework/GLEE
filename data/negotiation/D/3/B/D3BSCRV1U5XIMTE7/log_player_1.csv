Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still keeping you well above your minimum selling price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Going straight for $120 might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright."
