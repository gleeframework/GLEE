"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could we settle around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While that price is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $1,250,000?  This price recognizes your budget while ensuring I receive a fair return for the product.  I'm confident this is a win-win solution for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
