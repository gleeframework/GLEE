Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its value. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he wants the product badly.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is the only other one) adds a time pressure that might make Bob act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a single offer, and the success depends on how Bob perceives the value and Alice's negotiating skills. There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer."
