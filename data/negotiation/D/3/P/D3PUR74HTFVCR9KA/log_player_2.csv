"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its value. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and still saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. It's the most financially advantageous option."
