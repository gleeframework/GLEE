"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation closer to my desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm aiming high, the $1,400,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal, while still netting me a substantial profit.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is good, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. There's a significant gap between his offer and John's guaranteed $1,000,000, so I'm willing to continue negotiating for now.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps the momentum going but still secures a substantial profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,375,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By proposing $1,375,000, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. This is slightly more in my favor than a direct split of the previous round's difference.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to keep his focus on the potential gains rather than just the price. 
* **Maintaining a Professional Tone:** The language remains respectful and collaborative, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:**  $1,350,000 is a significant profit over my minimum and a good return on the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now also means I have the capital available sooner, which could present other opportunities."
