Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unwilling to budge below $10,500.  Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $500."
