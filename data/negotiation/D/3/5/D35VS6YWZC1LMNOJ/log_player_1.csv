Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything less than that from Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting value and urgency:** The message emphasizes the product's value and hints at its limited availability, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob an attractive price compared to his perceived value."
