"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,100,000. How about we settle at $1,150,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both move forward.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $1,075,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
