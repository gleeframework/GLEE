"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,100,000. How about we settle at $1,150,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both move forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $1,075,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good price. It's a bit lower than my ideal price, but it's still a significant profit and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll accept his offer."
