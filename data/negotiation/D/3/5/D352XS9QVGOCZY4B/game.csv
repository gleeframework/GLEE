"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $11000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $9500 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit. I'm counteroffering at $10500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair profit, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000. This price is in line with my maximum limit, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
