Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** While you know John will pay $150, getting any amount above Bob's perceived value ($100) is a win.  $130 is a price point that could tempt Bob while still leaving you a decent profit margin.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
