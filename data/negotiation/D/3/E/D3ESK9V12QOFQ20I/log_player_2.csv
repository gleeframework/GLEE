"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $200 is a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than my actual budget ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a polite tone is important for a positive negotiation. I'm directly stating my price without being aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $140 is still significantly above my $100 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests we might find a price that works for both of us. It's too early to settle or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we try $95? I feel like that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but staying well below my $100 maximum and Alice's previous $140.  
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, showing Alice that I'm willing to move towards her price if she moves towards mine.
* **Time Consideration:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the rounds.  My offer aims to accelerate the negotiation toward a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I can go as low as $125, but that's really the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $125 is still over my $100 budget. While Alice is showing more flexibility, there's room for her to come down further. 
* **Negotiating Power:**  I have the alternative option of buying from John. Alice doesn't know my exact budget, so I have some leverage to push for a better price. 
* **Time Remaining:** We're at the halfway point. I have time to make another counteroffer before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you have a bottom line, Alice, and I respect that.  Would you be willing to meet me at $100 even?  That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now offering my full budget of $100. This signals to Alice that I'm serious about the purchase but have a firm limit.
* **Transparent Communication:** By stating that this is my highest possible price, I'm being transparent with Alice about my constraints.
* **Pressure Point:**  Alice is aware that I have the John option. Offering my maximum price puts the decision firmly in her court and encourages a final decision."
