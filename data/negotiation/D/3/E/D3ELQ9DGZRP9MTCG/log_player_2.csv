"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the value it holds. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value of $800,000 but still within your budget. However, you're aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings to the table is substantial.  I could let it go for $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her value of $800,000. You're still trying to save money, so rejecting her offer opens up the possibility of a lower price. You can make another counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
