"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) than Alice's asking price ($14,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $12,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:** My message is polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting low, I'm aiming to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a deal significantly below John's $12,000 backup offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $12,500? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to recover a significant portion of the value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably in price, and $12,500 is now within a reasonable range of John's $12,000 offer. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and there's a risk she might withdraw the offer altogether. Accepting at this price secures a decent deal and avoids the potential of having to buy from John at full price."
