Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Backup Offer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, adjustments to the offer might be necessary."
