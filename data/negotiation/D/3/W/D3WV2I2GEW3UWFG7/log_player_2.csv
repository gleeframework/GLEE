"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your absolute maximum ($1,200,000), it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting her offer, you aim to negotiate a lower price or proceed with John's offer, which is only slightly higher."
