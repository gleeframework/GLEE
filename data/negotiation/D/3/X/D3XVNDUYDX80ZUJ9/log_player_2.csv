"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum value as possible.  A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise.  It's a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While lower than her initial offer, $1,350,000 is still more than Bob's maximum value. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option:** If the negotiations with Alice break down, Bob can still buy from John, but it's advantageous to explore all options before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving without giving up too much ground. It's a reasonable compromise that shows Bob is serious about the purchase, but still values his budget. 
* **Avoid John for Now:**  Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal with Alice before committing to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Maximum:** Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is only $25,000 above Bob's maximum of $1,200,000.  This is a very small difference.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a deadlock with Alice, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at the higher price.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With only five rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.  
* **Small Compromise:** Accepting this offer represents a relatively small compromise for Bob, considering the potential for a better deal is now low."
