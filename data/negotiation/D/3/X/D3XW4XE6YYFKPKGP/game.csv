"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to negotiate a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $11,750. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,750 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll be happy with it.",11500.0,Alice,7,
