Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $725,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $812,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below your maximum price and is carefully inching you upwards. John offers a guaranteed win at this point."
