"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $860,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $860,000 is tempting, I'm confident we can get closer to my target price with more negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $860,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $880,000.  This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm hoping we can get even closer to the sweet spot. I'm thinking $870,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to go a bit lower. How about $870,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to $900,000,  $870,000 is a good price and secures a sale.  It's better than risking a lower offer or selling to John for $800,000."
