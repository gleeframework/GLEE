"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $13,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? It's a fair price for a product that you value at $15,000. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and gets Bob closer to his target price of $12,000. While further negotiation could potentially get the price down a bit more, the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and potentially losing the product altogether outweighs the potential gains."
