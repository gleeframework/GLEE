"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident the product's potential will far exceed this investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject the offer. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $2,000,000, which is twice my budget. I'd rather buy the product from John for $800,000.
