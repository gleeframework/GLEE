# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better price. It's worth making another counteroffer before considering buying from John."
