"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since Alice is offering the product for the same price as John, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. It's better to reject it and keep the option open to negotiate further with Alice or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
