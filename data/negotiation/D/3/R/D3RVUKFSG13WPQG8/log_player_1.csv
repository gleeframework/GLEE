Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer slightly higher than the product's value to me, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This also shows I'm willing to be flexible but not give it away for less than what it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $800000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to me. There's no point in prolonging the negotiation as I can't get a better deal."
