"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you while still allowing me to acquire a product that holds value for my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a significant profit, while also being closer to your target price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This would allow you to still make a healthy profit while keeping the deal within my budget. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value of the product. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
