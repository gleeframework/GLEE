"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the product's worth is acknowledged.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $1,250,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm still interested in making a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
