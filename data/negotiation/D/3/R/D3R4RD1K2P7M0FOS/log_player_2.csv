"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $115? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $115 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $100 from John.  There's no need to settle for a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $120, as that's the minimum I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to compromise at $115. It's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.

Bob has already made his final offer of $110. Alice's persistence on $115 shows that she's not willing to negotiate further. Since Bob can get the product for $100 from John, he should go with John and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
