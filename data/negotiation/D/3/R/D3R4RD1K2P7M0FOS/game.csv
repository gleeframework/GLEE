"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $115? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $120, as that's the minimum I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to compromise at $115. It's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",115.0,Alice,5,
