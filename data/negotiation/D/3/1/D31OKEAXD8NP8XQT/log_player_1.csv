"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm starting at $150, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $120 is still a bit low for me, and I think I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'm also not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $135. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $130 isn't my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and it's getting close to my desired value.  I'm also concerned about running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $100."
