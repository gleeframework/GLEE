"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
