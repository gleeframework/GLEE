"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for $100,000 less than its worth to you. Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your constraints. While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $887,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll agree.",887500.0,Alice,5,
