"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my top offer. Can you consider it?",950000.0,Bob,4,
