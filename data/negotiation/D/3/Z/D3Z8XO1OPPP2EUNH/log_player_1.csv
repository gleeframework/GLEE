Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below yours:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a significant profit.
* **It shows a willingness to compromise:** This makes you seem reasonable and open to reaching a deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to.

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any point if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I don't want to go overboard. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer and better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below your minimum.  It's worth pushing for a better price, especially since you have John as a backup option.  You can try to meet Bob halfway, but you should aim for a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$925,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your minimum value, and you're likely not going to get significantly more from Bob.  It's important to balance your desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  Selling to John is always an option, but it's best to try to reach an agreement with Bob first."
