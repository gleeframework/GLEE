"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upward while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a deal at $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but it's still above my ideal price and what John is offering.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price well below Alice's last offer and closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I can offer you a deal at $95. It's a slight compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $95 is a reasonable price, especially considering I could end up paying $100 with John if negotiations drag on."
