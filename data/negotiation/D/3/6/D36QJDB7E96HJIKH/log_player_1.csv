"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression you value the product highly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $1,150,000 leaves a $50,000 potential profit for Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion and values Bob's input, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). We have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is our fallback option but not ideal at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is fair, the product's true value is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a significant advantage."", 
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession but Holding Firm:** We are making a concession from $1,150,000 to $1,110,000, showing flexibility but also indicating we won't drastically lower the price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help drive a quicker agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's high value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits he gains at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can stretch to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he's still interested and potentially willing to go higher. Accepting $1,075,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table. We're still above our fallback option of John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and attractive price."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal to Bob that we're serious about closing the deal near this price point. 
* **Small Concession:**  We're making another small concession, showing movement and willingness to compromise, but not dropping the price significantly.
* **Holding Firm:** We're still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value and leaves us with a good profit margin. 
 
This approach puts the ball in Bob's court and encourages him to make a decision.  It also prepares us for potentially accepting his next offer if he moves closer to our price or walking away and taking John's offer if necessary."
