{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation and ensuring I'm getting a decent profit.  I've also tried to build rapport with Bob by mentioning the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about $9,500? This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}
