"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less than $10,000.  By rejecting, he can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about $9,500? This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $9,500 is a good price for him, as he values the product at $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob losing the product to John."
