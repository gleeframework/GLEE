"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her product valuation and leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we create room for negotiation and gauge her willingness to move from her initial position.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our counteroffer is still comfortably below our maximum budget of $1,500,000 and leaves us with options for future concessions if needed. 
* **Polite and Professional:** We maintain a polite and professional tone to foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice's counteroffer only moved down $100,000, indicating she's not significantly budging yet. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a substantial gap between her offer ($1,200,000) and both our previous counteroffer ($1,000,000) and John's alternative price ($1,500,000).
* **Strategic Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about a lower price and encourage her to make a more significant move in the next round."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I had a slightly lower price point in mind. Would you be open to discussing a figure closer to $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're increasing our offer by $100,000, which is the same amount Alice lowered hers in the previous round. This demonstrates a willingness to move towards a compromise.
* **Still Below John's Price:** Our counteroffer remains significantly lower than buying from John, maintaining our leverage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended Question:** By asking if Alice is ""open to discussing"" this figure, we invite further negotiation without rigidly committing to a specific number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  Let's settle this right now - $1,150,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** Alice has come down $150,000 from her initial offer, indicating a stronger desire to close the deal.
* **Close to Target:**  $1,150,000 is a reasonable price, saving us $350,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Risk of Pushing Further:** While we might be able to get the price down slightly more, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible or that we could reach an impasse. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
