"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than it is to me, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  $120 is way over my limit, so I will reject the offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product.  It's the same price I can get from John, so if she rejects this offer, I'll just buy it from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $80. I've already made my best counteroffer, and she rejected it. There's no reason to continue negotiating with her, as I can get the product for my desired price from John."
