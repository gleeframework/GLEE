Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer sets a starting point for the negotiation. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum value but not so high as to scare Bob away immediately. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with simply getting my minimum. I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price. I'll counter his offer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway with this counteroffer. It's a compromise that keeps the price above my minimum while showing I'm open to negotiation. I'm also reiterating my interest in selling to him to keep the dialogue positive."
