"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This establishes a starting point for negotiation and forces Alice to consider a more substantial price reduction.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, it sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than John's offer.  Bob is only $50,000 away from John's price and has more negotiating leverage to potentially get a lower price from Alice. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating but also recognizes the potential for a deal. This is a strategic move to bridge the gap between their current positions and hopefully secure a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,220,000, only $20,000 more than John's price.  Considering there are only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and minimizes the risk of losing the deal to another buyer."
