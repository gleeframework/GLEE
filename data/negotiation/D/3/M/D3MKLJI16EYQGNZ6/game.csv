"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $887,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
