"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can try negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We start by countering with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still potentially profitable for her. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we are serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm happy with. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We are moving closer to a potential deal. By offering $75, we are splitting the difference between her previous offer and our last counter-offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price point below $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $80. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to her lowest acceptable price of $80. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is within our budget and a good deal compared to John's offer."
