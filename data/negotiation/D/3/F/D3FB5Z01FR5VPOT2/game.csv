"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $80. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
