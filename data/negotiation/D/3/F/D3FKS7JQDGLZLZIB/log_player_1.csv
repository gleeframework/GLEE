Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,500,000) but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept.
* **Negotiation Room:** This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone in my message.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum price.

This strategy aims to get the highest price possible while leaving room for negotiation and minimizing the risk of a complete breakdown in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $1500000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Since I have John as a guaranteed buyer for the same price, there's no immediate need to accept Bob's offer.  I'll try to squeeze out a bit more by counter-offering.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate another round of negotiation, potentially leading to a better deal.  It's a gamble, but with John as a fallback, the risk is mitigated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $1,500,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get a reasonable return and you to acquire the product at a competitive rate.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer but staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us, emphasizing the value of the product and the benefits of a mutually agreeable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed, but I'm not giving away too much.

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests and maintaining the potential for a profitable deal."
