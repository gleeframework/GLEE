"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a fair price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than Alice's value of $150, it's still more than Bob's maximum of $100.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is closer to his maximum, it's still above his target.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $110, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:  Bob is getting closer to his target, but $112.50 is still too high. At this point, the negotiation is getting too risky. Bob can secure the product from John for $100, which is his maximum.  It's better to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
