{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product, not just focusing on the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts.

**This strategy allows for:**

* **Potential for a good deal:** I might be able to get close to my desired price.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob counters, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses. 
* **Plan B:** If negotiation fails, I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, his willingness to negotiate shows he's interested. I can try to get a better price in the next round.
* **Avoiding the guaranteed $15,000:**  Selling to John would secure me a good profit, but I might be able to get even more if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""discount"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting the need for a solution that works for both of us.

**This strategy aims to:**

* **Keep the negotiation going:**  This counteroffer is more reasonable than the previous one and signals a willingness to negotiate.
* **Test Bob's willingness:**  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, it gives me more information about his price range.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it keeps me from being too inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is showing a strong interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to counter-offer.
* **Avoiding the guaranteed $15,000:**  While selling to John would be safe, I want to maximize my earnings.  Continuing negotiation gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and $9,000 is a good offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting the compromise and emphasizing that this price would be beneficial for both of us. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** While $9,500 is still below my desired price, it's closer to my target and still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By offering a compromise, I'm showing a willingness to work with Bob to find a solution.
* **Maximize my earnings:** While I'm not getting my ideal price, I'm still closer to it than before.
* **Maintain the possibility of selling to John:**  This is my last offer before I resort to selling to John. If Bob rejects, I'll move forward with Plan B and sell to John."
