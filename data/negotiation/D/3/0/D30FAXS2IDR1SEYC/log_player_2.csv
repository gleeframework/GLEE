Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and $9000 is a good offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9500?  This would be a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome.
