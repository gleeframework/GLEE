"Alice,  $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and $9000 is a good offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9500?  This would be a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",9500.0,Alice,5,
