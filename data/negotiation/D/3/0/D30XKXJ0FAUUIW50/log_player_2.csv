# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a very competitive price.  Let's discuss a deal that benefits us both.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than what John is asking. 
* **You still save money:**  While you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000), you are still saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
