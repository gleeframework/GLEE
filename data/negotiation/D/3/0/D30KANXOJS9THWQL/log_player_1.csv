Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,800,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive a subsequent lower offer as more reasonable.
* **Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the product's base value.

This strategy aims to maximize profit by leveraging psychological tactics. However, it's important to note that Bob could reject the offer outright."
