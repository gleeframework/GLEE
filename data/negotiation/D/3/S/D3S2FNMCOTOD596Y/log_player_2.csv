"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13,500. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:**  $13,500 is only $1,500 above Bob's maximum price, which is a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a better price in the next round. Alice might be firm on this price, and Bob could end up paying more or having to buy from John.
* **Time is a factor:**  While Bob wants to save money, he also wants to close the deal. Accepting Alice's offer is a good balance between saving money and avoiding further negotiation."
