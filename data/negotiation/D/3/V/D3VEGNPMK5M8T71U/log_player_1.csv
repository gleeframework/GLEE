Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $120 is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him incentive to negotiate. This also allows you to potentially secure a higher price during the negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is straightforward and focuses on the price, ensuring Bob understands your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:** While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still quite close to your minimum value. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  You have room to negotiate a higher price.  Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than your minimum.  A counteroffer could lead to a better deal for you. 

**Next Steps:** You can make a counteroffer to Bob that's slightly lower than your initial offer, but still higher than $100. This shows you're willing to compromise but also value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to go a little lower, how about $110?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to budge from your initial price, but still maintain a profit above your minimum.
* **Fairness:**  $110 is still a decent deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than his perceived value of $150.
* **Motivates further negotiation:**  This price might prompt Bob to either accept or make another counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process moving forward."
