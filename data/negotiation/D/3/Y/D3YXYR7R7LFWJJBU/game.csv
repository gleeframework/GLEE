"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $12000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $16000? This would still be a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm confident this product is worth a lot, but I'm looking for a price closer to $14000. Would you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
