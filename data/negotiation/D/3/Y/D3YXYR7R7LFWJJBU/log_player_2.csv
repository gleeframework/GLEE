```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $16000? This would still be a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still within my 10 rounds and haven't reached my ideal price. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
