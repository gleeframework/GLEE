{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to the right buyer.  I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:**  This is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. It highlights the value of the product to encourage him to consider the offer. 

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will give me an indication of his perceived value of the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** A friendly approach can lead to a more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to try to secure a higher price, especially since he expressed interest in the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with an offer slightly higher than $12,000, aiming to find a middle ground. This will allow me to gauge his commitment to buying the product while potentially earning a better price than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest,  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $15,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering $15,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** The message highlights the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter if necessary. 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Find a Middle Ground:** It aims to bridge the gap between our positions, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly, building rapport and increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Show Flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,500 is a significant improvement over John's offer and is closer to my desired value. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a better return than selling to John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of Product:**  $13,500 is still a good price for me, given my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation, saving me time and effort.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price, and it could also risk Bob losing interest. 

By accepting this offer, I secure a good price without risking further negotiation and potential lost opportunity."
