"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm also not giving away the product for too cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $98. This is a slight increase from his offer, but still below my ideal price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below what I'd ideally like, it's getting closer to my target and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to push for a higher price."
