You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $20,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal. He's offering $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. $14,000 is a midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's getting closer, Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

Bob is offering $13,000, which is closer to his maximum budget but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate. He's trying to find a middle ground that both parties can accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's likely that the negotiation is getting nowhere. Bob can always buy the product from John for $12,000, which is within his budget.  This guarantees him the product at a price he's comfortable with, rather than continuing to haggle with Alice and risking a deal that might not happen."
