"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we try $7,200? It's a small compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",7200.0,Alice,5,
