Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. It also gives you some room to negotiate down if necessary. However, if Bob rejects it, you can always make a counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at your minimum threshold.  While tempting, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a bit higher.  There's still potential to earn more, and you can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than your initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal, hopefully encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below your minimum threshold. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely he'll continue to lower his offers.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum value."
