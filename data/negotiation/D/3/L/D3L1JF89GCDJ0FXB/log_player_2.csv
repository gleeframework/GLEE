"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $950,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest in this product for the long term.  To make it truly worthwhile for me, I'd need to see a price closer to $850,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price much closer to Alice's bottom line. This shows he's serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights Bob's long-term interest in the product, making the lower price more appealing to Alice. 
* **Negotiation Range:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation within a reasonable range, leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to invest in our product for the long term. In light of that, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value:** At $900,000, the price is still significantly lower than buying from John and within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer might lead to further negotiations, but there's a risk of Alice getting stubborn and refusing to go lower, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John.

This decision balances the need to save money with the risk of losing the opportunity to purchase from Alice."
