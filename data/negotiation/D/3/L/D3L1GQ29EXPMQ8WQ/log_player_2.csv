"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes my limit early on and hopefully encourages Alice to come down from her initial asking price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also staying firm with my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and make this a quick deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12000, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $14000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go to $13000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?
