Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it holds."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's maximum valuation is $800,000, we don't want to start there. Opening with a higher price leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal for Alice. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies that the product's value might be even higher than Bob's estimation, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a strong fallback position with John, ensuring she won't settle for anything less than $1,500,000. This allows her to be firm in her negotiation with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
