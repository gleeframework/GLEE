Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  $10,000 is a good middle ground between your minimum and Bob's perceived value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth seeing if you can squeeze a bit more out of the deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him with another counteroffer, the risk of him walking away and you having to sell to John for $8,000 is too high.  It's better to secure the deal at $8,750."
