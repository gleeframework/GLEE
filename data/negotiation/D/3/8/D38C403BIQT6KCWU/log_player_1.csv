{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $1,200,000, so starting at $1,350,000 gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's fair to Bob:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's better to reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,250,000?  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your asking price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000.  This offer represents a significant saving for me while still giving you a fair price for your product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired amount.  Considering that John is willing to pay my minimum, it's safer to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  I'm not guaranteed to get a higher price from Bob, and it's not worth the potential for a stalemate."
