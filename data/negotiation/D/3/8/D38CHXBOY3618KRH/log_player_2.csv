This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $75,000 less than John's price and $175,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has clearly stated that $925,000 is her lowest price.  Continuing negotiations might frustrate her and risk the deal.
* **Time Value:**  While you have rounds remaining, securing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

It's a strong deal that meets your goal of saving money."
