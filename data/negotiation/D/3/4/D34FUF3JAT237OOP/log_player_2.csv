"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make it a great deal for you. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her perceived value, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at a much lower price."
