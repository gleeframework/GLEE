"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer, but I'm starting high to see what's possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a higher price. While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,000. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial price, this is a good deal. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
