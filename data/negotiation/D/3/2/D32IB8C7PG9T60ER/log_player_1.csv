# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and the risk of further rounds leading to a lower offer or even selling to John for $800,000 is too high.  $885,000 is a good compromise that secures a decent profit."
