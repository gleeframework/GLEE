Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a strategic investment for Bob.

By starting high but not unreasonable, Alice increases her chances of either:

* **Securing a premium price:** Bob might accept the offer outright.
* **Negotiating a favorable deal:**  Bob might counter-offer, leading to a final price closer to his maximum.

This strategy ensures Alice avoids leaving too much money on the table."
