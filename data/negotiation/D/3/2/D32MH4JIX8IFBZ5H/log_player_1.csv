Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is less than Bob's estimated value of $15,000, leaving space for him to counteroffer.
* **It shows you're serious:** By presenting a specific price, you demonstrate that you're ready to negotiate seriously. 

Remember, this is just the first step! You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
