Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to sell it for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance Bob might pay more than his personal valuation of $80.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price of $100. This price point is likely to be more appealing to Bob than a price closer to my guaranteed sale price.
* **First Offer Advantage:** By making the first offer, I set the anchor for the negotiation, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale above my minimum price and potentially maximizing my profit if Bob is willing to pay closer to my asking price."
