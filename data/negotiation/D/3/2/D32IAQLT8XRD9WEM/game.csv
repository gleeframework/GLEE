,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $78.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",78.0,Bob,4,
