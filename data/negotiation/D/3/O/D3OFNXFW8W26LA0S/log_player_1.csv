"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you have a budget, and while I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,250? Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my absolute limit.  If that works for you, we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum threshold, and I'm happy to close the deal. I don't want to risk him walking away or me having to deal with more rounds of negotiation."
