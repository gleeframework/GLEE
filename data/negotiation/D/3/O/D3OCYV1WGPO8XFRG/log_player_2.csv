Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully encourage her to negotiate further.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

While $1,800,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,500,000, which is halfway between Alice's last offer and my maximum budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

Alice is not willing to budge much further, and $1,950,000 is still above my maximum budget. It's time to move on to John, who offers the product at a price I can afford."
