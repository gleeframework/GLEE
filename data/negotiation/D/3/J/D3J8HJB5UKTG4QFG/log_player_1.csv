Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's fallback:** Alice is guaranteed $800,000 from John. This is her ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Potential for profit:** There's a chance to get more than $800,000 from Bob, but Alice needs to balance profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**A Strong Opening Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Aiming high:** Starting significantly above Bob's valuation increases the potential for a higher sale price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A high starting point allows Alice to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a price well above her minimum.
* **Confidence:** A direct, confident message can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Market research:**  If Alice has information about similar products selling for even more, she could adjust her price upward.
* **Bob's personality:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher to create more negotiation space. 
 
**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob to find a price they both find acceptable."
