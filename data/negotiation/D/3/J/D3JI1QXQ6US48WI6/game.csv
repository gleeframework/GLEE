"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,750? I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my means.",10750.0,Bob,4,
