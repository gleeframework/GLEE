"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $140 is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so it's best to reject this offer and go with your cheaper alternative."
