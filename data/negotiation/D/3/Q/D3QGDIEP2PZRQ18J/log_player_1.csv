Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.
