"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This opening offer is ambitious, aiming to secure a high price. However, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't immediately convinced.  I'm confident in the product's value and am willing to negotiate, but also prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price,  it's still higher than my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore counteroffers to try and reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial offer.  How about we compromise at $1,750,000? This still gives you a great deal and allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a strategic compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum.  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I believe in the product's value. The message emphasizes collaboration and a shared benefit, creating a more positive and open negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $1750000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my original offer and your last offer at $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, continuing to negotiate further risks losing the deal altogether.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John who is willing to pay the same amount, it's strategically sound to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
