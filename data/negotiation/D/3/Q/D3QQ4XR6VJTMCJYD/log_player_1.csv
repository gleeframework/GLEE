Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer aims to maximize my potential profit while still being appealing to Bob. Here's the reasoning:

* **My minimum:**  I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000, so this is my floor.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  Offering $11,500 splits the difference between my minimum and Bob's value. This makes it a potentially attractive deal for both of us.

If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and make a profit. If he accepts, I'll get a higher price and a bigger profit."
