It's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds and, even though Bob is showing good faith, the price hasn't quite reached my desired level. With the risk of losing too much money and time, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a safer bet than continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with an even lower price."
