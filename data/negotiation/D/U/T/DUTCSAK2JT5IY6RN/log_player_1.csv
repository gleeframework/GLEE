Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is still significantly above your minimum of $1,000,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's still room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious:** This price demonstrates that you're not just trying to get the lowest possible price, you're willing to negotiate fairly. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit, it's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  There's still room to negotiate for a higher price.  Let's see if we can push for closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're still trying to maximize your profit.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable middle ground:** It creates a fair compromise that both parties might find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is still higher than what John is willing to pay, it's getting dangerously close to my minimum.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that we could reach an impasse and end up with a lower price than John's offer. 

Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000, which is a comfortable margin. It's better to secure a sure thing than to risk a lower price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
