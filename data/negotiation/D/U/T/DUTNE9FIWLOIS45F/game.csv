"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you place on this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a reasonable price considering the value we've discussed.  I believe this offer reflects a fair middle ground for us both. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from here.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us, and I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. It's also well within my budget and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
