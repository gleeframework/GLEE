Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and accept, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to counter and even walk away to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price point. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and is a better deal than selling to John for $12,000."
