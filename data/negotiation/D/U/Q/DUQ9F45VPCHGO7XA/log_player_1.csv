I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a good starting point in the negotiation."

While I'm not happy with Bob's low offer, I want to try and see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at more than $80."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $90. Bob has already rejected this price once, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.  We are nearing the middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating for a higher price, I'm starting to run out of time.  Bob's offer of $87 is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll accept this offer and sell the product."
