"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000 for the product.  This still leaves you with a solid profit and gets us closer to a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to gain significant value from this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $875000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my desired price point to make this work. How about we settle on $890000? This offers you a significant saving while allowing me to secure a fair deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your need for a fair price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $880000.  This is a significant saving for me while still ensuring you make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal!",880000.0,Bob,6,
