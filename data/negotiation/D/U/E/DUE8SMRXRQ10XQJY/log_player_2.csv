"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose all the details at this stage, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice is asking for $1,500,000, which is more than your maximum.  Therefore, it's better to reject her offer and buy from John for a lower price."
