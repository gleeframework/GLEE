"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a bit less than my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. Let me know if that works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  Bob should continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $10,500.  There's still room for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for you, and I think it's fair for me too.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has returned to her initial offer of $12,000.  While this is a tempting price, Bob should reject it. He has already shown willingness to pay a bit more than $10,500, and it's possible to get closer to that with another counteroffer.  There's no need to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12250. This is as close as I can get to our previous discussions, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,250 is closer to Bob's target price than John's price of $15,000.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer.  While Bob could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice could walk away or the negotiations could drag on further.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids potential delays or complications."
