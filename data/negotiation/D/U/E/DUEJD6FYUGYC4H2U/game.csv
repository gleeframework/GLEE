"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise we can both be happy with. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
