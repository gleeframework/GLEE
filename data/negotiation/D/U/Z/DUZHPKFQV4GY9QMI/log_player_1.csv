"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This can help him understand why the price is high and potentially make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not closing the door on negotiation. I'm leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  We'll see how Bob responds.  If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all avenues with Bob before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we try to find a compromise at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my target, it's still not ideal. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a more favorable agreement within the remaining rounds. Selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference at $975,000? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our needs. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate by offering a price closer to Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting that this price is a ""fair compromise,"" emphasizing a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting ""Let's close this deal and make it happen,"" encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price with this offer.  However, I'm still holding out for a bit more. We have only five rounds left, and I need to carefully consider if it's worth risking losing the deal to John for the sake of gaining a few extra thousand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $975,000. How about we try $937,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds left, the time is running out.  Bob's offer of $937,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm now at a point where the risk of continuing to negotiate with him is too high. 

I've already shown flexibility and compromise, but it seems clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price.  Instead of potentially wasting the remaining rounds, I'll secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 by selling to John.  This decision ensures I receive the minimum I need and avoids the risk of ending up with a much lower offer from Bob."
