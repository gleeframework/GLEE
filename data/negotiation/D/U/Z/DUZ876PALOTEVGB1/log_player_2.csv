**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $775,000.  While we could try one more counteroffer, it's very risky. If she rejects it, we're left with her $775,000 offer or having to go to John at $1,000,000. 

At this point, cutting our losses and going with John's guaranteed $1,000,000 price is the safest option. It's better to overpay slightly than risk a much higher price if the negotiation fails."
