"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth less to Alice, so he can try to get a lower price."
