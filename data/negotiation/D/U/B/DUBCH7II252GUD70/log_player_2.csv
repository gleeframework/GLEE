"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great value at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay close to $12,000, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $12,000. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $13,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget of $12,000.  Bob can continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his limit.  There's still room for compromise, and rejecting the offer gives him a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a bit more. How about $12,750? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with this price."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $12,750, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's getting close, but with only a few rounds left, the risk of not getting a lower price is too high. Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $12,000, making it the best choice at this point."
