"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $12,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
