Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also signals the high value I place on the product.  I'm confident Bob will counter-offer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects my offer outright, I'll have to consider my options and potentially switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I hope Bob will find this offer more appealing, and we can finally reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $920,000 is a good price and it seems like Bob is firm on his position. It's better to take a good deal now than risk getting nothing at all."
