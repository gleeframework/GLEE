"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $120. Considering its quality and unique features, I'm extending this exclusive offer to you at a special price of $150. This is an opportunity not to be missed, as it's significantly below its market value.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $150 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, given it's the maximum I'm comfortable spending. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I would need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $125 for the product. This is still slightly above your offer but significantly below the product's market value. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend. I'm confident I can get a good deal with John, who is selling the same product for $100.  If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to pay $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find common ground. I am willing to sell the product for $115. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal suits your needs better.",115.0,Alice,5,
