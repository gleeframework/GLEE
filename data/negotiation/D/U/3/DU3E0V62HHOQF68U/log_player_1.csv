Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($120). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, it opens the door for counteroffers.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay $120. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer at $120, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, would $130 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing):**  While closer to your desired price, this offer creates the impression of moving towards a middle ground, which can encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but leaves room for further negotiation if needed while staying above your safety net of $120 from John.
* **Maintaining Control:** By offering a counteroffer, you maintain control of the negotiation's direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $130 is still a little high for me. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this deal work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer has increased, $95 is still considerably less than your minimum of $120 and the $120 you could get from John.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly in his offers. This suggests he might be trying to see how low you're willing to go before significantly increasing his price.
* **Alternative Available:** The risk of continuing negotiations is relatively low because you have the guaranteed option of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is just too far off from what I need to make this work.  If you're serious about buying,  would you be willing to consider $115?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal to Bob that you are serious and unlikely to go much lower.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering $115 is a small concession that might be enough to close the deal without losing too much potential profit.
* **Above Bottom Line:** Crucially,  $115 keeps you above your minimum acceptable price ($120) while leaving a small margin for negotiation if Bob makes one final counter.
* **Alternative Ready:**  You remain prepared to walk away and take John's offer if Bob rejects this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $105. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $105. He's signaled this by saying he'll walk away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer of $120. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** The potential gain from continuing to haggle with Bob (maybe $5-10) is not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $15 profit from John.  

By choosing John, you secure a sure profit and avoid potentially wasting time in a deadlocked negotiation."
