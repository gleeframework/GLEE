"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate and can come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,650,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a reasonable price considering our positions. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,525,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,462,500. It's a fair price that's closer to my budget and your asking price. This feels like a win-win for both of us.",1462500.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I understand this is a difficult negotiation, but $1,493,750 is still a bit higher than my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,425,000.
