Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a reasonable price considering our positions. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

While a higher price might be achievable, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are now above the halfway point between his initial offer and my asking price.  Accepting now minimizes risk of losing the deal entirely and secures a significant profit."
