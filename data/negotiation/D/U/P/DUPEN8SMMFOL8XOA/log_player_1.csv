Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high price. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
