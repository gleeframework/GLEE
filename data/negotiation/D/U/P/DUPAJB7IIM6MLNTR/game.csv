"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?  That's still a great deal for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $130 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That way we both get a fair price.",125.0,Alice,5,
