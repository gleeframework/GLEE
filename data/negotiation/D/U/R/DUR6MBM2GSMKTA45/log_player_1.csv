Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you value highly, for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safety net at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob allows for a strategic offer above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit."
