"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to her value of $800,000. You can always fall back on buying from John for $1,500,000 if needed."
