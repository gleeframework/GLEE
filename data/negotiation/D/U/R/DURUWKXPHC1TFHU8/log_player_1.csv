Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a tactic to see if he's willing to pay more than his initial estimate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm reducing my price to $95. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. It's still above his initial offer, but closer to his valuation.  I'm hoping this will entice him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100. I'll make another counteroffer, but if it's rejected, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $90. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's higher than his last offer. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $100, as it seems our negotiations are nearing a stalemate."
