Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm prepared to sell for $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let me know if this works for you.
