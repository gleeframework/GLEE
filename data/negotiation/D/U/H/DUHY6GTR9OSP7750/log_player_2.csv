Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final concession. If we can agree on $13,000, I'm confident we can close the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While $13,000 is getting closer to his budget, there are only a few rounds left and there's no guarantee Alice will accept his next counteroffer. It's better to lock in the sure deal with John and save himself the risk of further negotiation."
