"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value it holds for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
