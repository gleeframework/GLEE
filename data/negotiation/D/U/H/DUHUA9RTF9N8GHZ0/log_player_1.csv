"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  My initial offer is $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential for significant return on investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to negotiate further to secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value it holds for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I've already reached round 4 and there are only 6 rounds left.  This means there's a high risk that we won't be able to reach a higher price point in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John right now guarantees me the best possible outcome without risking further negotiations."
