I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price of $120."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it meets my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm offering $140. This is still more than my minimum but shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob will be agreeable to this price."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer and still above my minimum.  I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation."
