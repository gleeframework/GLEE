I am rejecting Bob's offer because it is lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to sell the product, it's essential to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I would like to sell to Bob, his final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees I meet my financial goals and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
