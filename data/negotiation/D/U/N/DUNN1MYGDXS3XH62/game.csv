"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $17500?",17500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $20000 and $17500, which would be $18750. What do you think?",18750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $18750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $16000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair considering its value to you is at least $15000",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to reduce the price to $18000, which is still above your initial offer but closer to your new offer. I'm confident that this price is still a good value for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $18000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $18000, which would be $17000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise",17000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $17000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll throw in a small bonus, worth $500, to sweeten the deal. This brings the total price to $17500. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $17000. I'd like to make a new offer of $16500. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise considering the bonus you're offering",16500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16500, but I'll throw in an additional bonus, worth $250, to make up for the difference. This brings the total price to $16750. This is my final offer. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer",16500.0,Bob,10,
