"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for potential concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $13,500.  I'll try to meet him halfway between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  That's still a good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. How about we meet at $12900? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $13,500. However, we're getting closer. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but I'm not going to drop my price too much further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a good deal here. How about we compromise again and meet at $13,050?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13050} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $12750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been negotiating for several rounds, and while Bob is willing to compromise, his offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal.  I'll take John's offer of $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price and don't waste any more time with Bob."
