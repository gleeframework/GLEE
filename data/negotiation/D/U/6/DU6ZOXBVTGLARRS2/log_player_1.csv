Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message sets a positive tone.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** Bob might counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to give away the product too cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85. Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** $85 is only slightly above my minimum of $80, which means I'm not getting a good deal. 
* **Potential for better:** Bob clearly values the product and is willing to pay more than $80. There's room for negotiation. 
* **No rush:**  I have John as a backup if negotiations fall apart, so I can afford to be patient and try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to $95.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you get from the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive, making it more likely he'll be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:** $90 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than my minimum of $80 and close to my desired price of $95. 
* **No need for risk:**  While I could try for $95, there's a risk Bob might reject my offer again and I'd be forced to sell to John for $80.  
* **Strong position:**  I'm in a strong position because Bob clearly wants the product and is willing to pay close to my desired price. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent profit without risking a lower price."
