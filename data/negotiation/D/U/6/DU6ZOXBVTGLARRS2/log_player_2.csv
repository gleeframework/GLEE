Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to $95.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you get from the product.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

* Bob will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
