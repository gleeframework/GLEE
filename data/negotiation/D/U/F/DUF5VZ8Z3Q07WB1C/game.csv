"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $750000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. My counteroffer is $1000000. This gives you a good deal while still being fair to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so my counteroffer is $900000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $950000. I'm confident that this product is worth that much to you, considering its value.  My counteroffer is $950000. Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to stay above $950000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to compromise, so my counteroffer is $920000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $920000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  My counteroffer is $940000. I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,7,
