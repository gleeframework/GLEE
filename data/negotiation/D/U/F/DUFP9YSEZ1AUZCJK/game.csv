"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects the fair market value and provides you with a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the full potential and uniqueness of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on this product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement this round.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
