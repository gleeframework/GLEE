Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects the fair market value and provides you with a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.
