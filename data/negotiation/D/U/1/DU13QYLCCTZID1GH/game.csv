"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential growth opportunities.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I see in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential growth opportunities. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the continued negotiations.  While I recognize your offer of $1250000 represents a step closer to my asking price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1275000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential growth opportunities. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $1275000 is still below what I consider fair for the product's value and potential.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1290000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a balanced price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
