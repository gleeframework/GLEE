Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $15,000 to $14,000, and now you're asking me to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250 just yet. I can do $12,000, which is my minimum price. I'm willing to hold out for that, but I'm also keeping an eye on the market, so I might need to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement.
