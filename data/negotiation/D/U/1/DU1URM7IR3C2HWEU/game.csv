"I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $15,000 to $14,000, and now you're asking me to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference between $10,000 and $12,500 and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250 just yet. I can do $12,000, which is my minimum price. I'm willing to hold out for that, but I'm also keeping an eye on the market, so I might need to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
