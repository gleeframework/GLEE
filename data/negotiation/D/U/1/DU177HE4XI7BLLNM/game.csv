"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about $12,200?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I'm trying to stay closer to $11,000. How about we split the difference and call it $11,600?",11600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $11,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about $12,000? That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's actually the price I was thinking of selling it to John for, so I'm motivated to close the deal with you if we can agree on this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
