Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $11,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about $12,000? That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's actually the price I was thinking of selling it to John for, so I'm motivated to close the deal with you if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** She's stated this is her lowest price and even mentioned she was considering John at this price.
* **Savings are good:** You're getting a $3,000 discount from John's price and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Time is ticking:**  While you have a few rounds left, there's no guarantee of getting a better price from Alice. 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing negotiations might risk losing the deal. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids potential complications."
