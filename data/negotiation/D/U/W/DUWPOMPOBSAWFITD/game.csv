"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident the product will bring you significant value. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable asset.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your commitment. However, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price. To demonstrate my continued willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd like to propose a price of $980,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can agree on this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your commitment to this deal.  However, $980,000 is still a bit too low.  To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope it reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting close to my target price, but I'd like to propose a price of $990,000.

"Bob, we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $990,000 is tempting, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
