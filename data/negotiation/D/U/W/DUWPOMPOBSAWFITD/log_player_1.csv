"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds great value for your business, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value for Bob's business to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to negotiate further, demonstrating flexibility.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price point where Bob is willing to pay, but I still get as close as possible to my minimum. By starting high and showing a willingness to negotiate, I can maximize my chances of getting a good deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I need to keep in mind John's offer of $1,500,000. If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I have a guaranteed backup. 
* **Bob's Worth:** I know Bob values the product at $800,000. This means there's a substantial gap, but also a good amount of potential profit. 
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** I need to be prepared for potential counteroffers and be willing to adjust my price based on Bob's reactions."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower to demonstrate flexibility. This will help keep the negotiation moving forward while protecting my interests.
* **Maintain Leverage:** It's important to maintain leverage by not accepting his initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm serious about maximizing my return.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,500,000. This gives me a safety net and a strong bargaining position.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum. This will hopefully convince Bob to come closer to my asking price."

**Strategy:**

By showing a willingness to compromise while still emphasizing the product's value, I hope to incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price point. My counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and potential agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Budget:** I need to consider Bob's stated budget and ensure my counteroffer remains within a realistic range.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase. Let's finalize the deal.

```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.  While I've shown flexibility throughout the negotiation, I cannot afford to accept a price that would result in such a large financial loss.

**Strategy:**

* **John's Offer:** I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is the best option to maximize my return and avoid a significant financial loss.
* **Time and Risk:**  With only one round left, there is no guarantee that Bob will agree to a higher price. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed deal with John.
* **Future Negotiations:**  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob, this outcome will provide valuable experience for future negotiations.

**Conclusion:**

By choosing to sell to John, I'm prioritizing my financial goals and ensuring a profitable outcome. While I would have preferred to reach an agreement with Bob, this experience has taught me the importance of setting a firm minimum price point and having a backup plan."
