"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great price for a product worth $150, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. Let's meet in the middle, I think that's fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
