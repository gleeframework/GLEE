Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor point.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, shifting the focus from the actual cost.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for Bob to potentially accept. Even if he negotiates down slightly, you're still likely to secure a significantly higher price than selling to John."
