Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is significantly above your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, leaving space for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **It sets a firm starting point:** By offering a specific price, you avoid getting caught in a back-and-forth that could lead to a lower price. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he counters, analyze his offer carefully before deciding whether to accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it leaves some room for profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to consider his offer, selling for less than your minimum would be a loss.  

**Next Steps:**

Since you've rejected Bob's offer, you'll need to make a counteroffer. It's important to be firm but reasonable. Here's a possible counteroffer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to your ideal price:**  It's still above your minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  It allows for another round of negotiation if needed.
* **Is respectful but firm:**  It acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal while maintaining your own needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about we settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to negotiate a price that is closer to his initial offer but still higher than his absolute minimum. By offering $1,075,000, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while trying to secure a better deal for himself. He is also attempting to appeal to Alice's desire to reach a mutually agreeable price."
