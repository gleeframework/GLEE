Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest price Bob might accept allows you to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While close to Bob's perceived value, the price allows for some potential negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if not explicit about John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit from Bob with the security of knowing you have a guaranteed sale to John if needed."
