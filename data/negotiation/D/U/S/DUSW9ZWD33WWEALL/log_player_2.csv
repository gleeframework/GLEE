"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, and there are 9 more rounds to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. This gives us some room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that is favorable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than my target. I have more rounds to negotiate and can try to lower the price further. Buying from John at this point would be significantly more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum price point and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, and we're only halfway through the negotiation.  While I could potentially try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and we might not be able to reach a deal. Accepting this offer saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
