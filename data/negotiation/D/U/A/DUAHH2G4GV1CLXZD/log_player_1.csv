"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$60 is far too low for me. It's not even close to my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll continue to counteroffer in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm dropping the price to $105. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it's right at my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm not going to give it away for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and the price is still below my minimum. I'm running out of rounds and I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. I'll sell to John for $100, which is a guaranteed profit."
