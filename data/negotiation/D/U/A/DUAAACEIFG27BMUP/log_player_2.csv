"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident it will be of great benefit to you, but I understand you may need time to assess its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its potential, but I'm flexible and open to negotiation.  If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer. Please let me know your decision.
