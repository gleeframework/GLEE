"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives us room to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.  We also want to make it clear that we are interested, but only at a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down a bit, but we're still aiming lower. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're inching closer to a price that works for us while still acknowledging Alice's desire for a higher price.  We're aiming for a balance between assertiveness and willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $82 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $80.50. It's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very close to her minimum price. We're going to play a bit of hardball here and see if we can push her just a little bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $75 is really my limit. If you're unable to do that, I might have to consider other options."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

We are sticking to our previous offer while hinting that we might walk away if Alice doesn't budge. This creates a sense of urgency and might push her to accept our offer, especially since it's only slightly above her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $79. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower.  This price is a good deal and it's not worth the risk of pushing her further and potentially losing the deal."
