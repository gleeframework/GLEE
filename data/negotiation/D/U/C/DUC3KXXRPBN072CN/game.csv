"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $82 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $80.50. It's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to you.",80.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $75 is really my limit. If you're unable to do that, I might have to consider other options.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $79. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $75.",79.0,Alice,7,
