"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($20,000) compared to your maximum budget of $10,000. It's not worth accepting.  You should reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, $10,000. This reflects my budget and leaves no room for further negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will accept, but if she doesn't, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget, even if it's lower than her initial price.  Since John is willing to sell the product for my maximum budget, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
