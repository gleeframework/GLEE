"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This would allow us both to reach a fair agreement.  Let me know if you're interested.",13250.0,Alice,5,
