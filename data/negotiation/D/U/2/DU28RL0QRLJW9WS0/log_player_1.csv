"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'll be interested in.  My asking price is $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage a positive interaction.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation, indicating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value still higher:**  $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still potentially get closer to my desired price point of $140.
* **Testing Bob's willingness:** Rejecting allows me to gauge how flexible Bob is and if he's genuinely interested in this price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer Bob, but $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still moving closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing the value of the product and Bob's potential satisfaction keeps the negotiation friendly. 
* **Specific number:**  Instead of a vague ""closer,"" I'm giving a concrete price point to encourage a clear decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $135. How about we try $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum threshold:**  Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Potential for better offers:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, there's no guarantee a future round will yield a better result. Accepting allows me to secure a sale and potentially use the remaining rounds to negotiate a higher price with John if I choose to sell to him later."
