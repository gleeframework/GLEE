"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I can do $8,500, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I like that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. Let's make this simple, I'll offer $8,200. That's a decent jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $8,600, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,7,
