"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm confident it can generate much more for you in the long run.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
