{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $120.  You can likely get a better deal than $90, so it's worth negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  $92 is still a bit high for me.  How about $87?  That's a fair compromise, and closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $90 is very close to your ideal price point, and you've already been negotiating for several rounds.  It's probably time to accept to avoid running the risk of having to buy from John for a higher price."
