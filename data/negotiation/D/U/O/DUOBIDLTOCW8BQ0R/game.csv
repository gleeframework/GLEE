"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial ask. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still hoping for a bit more room to compromise.  How about $1,300,000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a competitive price.  However, $1,300,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, with a final offer of $1,325,000. This is my best price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
