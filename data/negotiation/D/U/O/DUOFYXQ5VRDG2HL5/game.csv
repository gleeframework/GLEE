"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good value for you considering your price range. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $12,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $15,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.
