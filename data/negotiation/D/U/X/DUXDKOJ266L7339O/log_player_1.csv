Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could continue to push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,530,000 is a strong outcome. It exceeds Bob's initial offer by $30,000 and gives me a healthy profit above my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or my offer falling below this point."
