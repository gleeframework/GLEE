"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer immediately.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price.  The threat of buying from John provides leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This establishes his intention to negotiate aggressively and sets the stage for potential bargaining.  The price of $75 is still within Bob's acceptable range, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not the best deal. Bob can continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $75.  There's still time and leverage to potentially get a better deal, so rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, but still trying to get a good deal. By offering $80, he shows he is serious about buying the product but also wants to save some money. This offer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal in the next round."
