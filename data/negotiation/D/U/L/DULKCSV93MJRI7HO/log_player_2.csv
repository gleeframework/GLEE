"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than $900,000, so it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her estimated value. This makes it a reasonable starting point and gives Alice room to bargain without feeling like she's being forced to accept a deal she finds unfair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's previous offer, but still below his maximum price.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price, as there's still room for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise. However, he's staying below Alice's latest offer, indicating his desire to reach a price that's closer to his target. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving room for Alice to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's getting closer.  It's now below Bob's maximum price with John, so accepting this offer is the most beneficial option.  Continuing to negotiate risks ending up with a higher price or losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a reasonable price within Bob's budget."
