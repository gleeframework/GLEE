Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $17000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13000.  I think this is a fair price that would benefit both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I can't accept an offer that's below my minimum price point. I'll counter Bob's offer again in hopes of finding a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $13,000 is still below my minimum price point, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $15,500? This offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but I'm still struggling to reach $15500.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum price point of $15,000.  I've already made several concessions and it doesn't seem like we're going to reach an agreeable price.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $15,000."
