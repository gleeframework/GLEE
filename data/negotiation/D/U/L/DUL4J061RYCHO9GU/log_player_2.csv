"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. There's no reason to accept it immediately. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20,000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but it's still within your budget.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while establishing a strong starting point. You'll need to gauge Alice's reaction to see if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her original price, $17,000 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You should continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. You can potentially get the product from John for $12,000, so you have that option as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  I think this is a fair price that would benefit both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've shown a willingness to negotiate and move closer to Alice's price, but you're still holding firm to your budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $13000 is still below my minimum price point, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $15500? This offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made a significant concession, $15,500 is still above your budget of $12,000. It's important to keep in mind that you have a backup option with John, who is selling the same product for $12,000. There's no need to rush into a deal that is not financially advantageous to you. You should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but I'm still struggling to reach $15,500.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that you are willing to meet Alice halfway. $14,000 is still within your budget and is closer to Alice's minimum price.  It's a strong offer that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round.  You are approaching your maximum budget, so you'll need to weigh your options carefully based on Alice's response."
