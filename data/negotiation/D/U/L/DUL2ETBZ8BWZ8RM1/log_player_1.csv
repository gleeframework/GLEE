"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for the value it provides!  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but I know I can always come down. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value ($1,000,000) as possible. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, so Bob doesn't feel like he has no chance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is below my minimum value of $1,000,000, and I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I can come down a bit, but I'm still firm on selling for at least $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $900000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe there's still potential to get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  I can't go lower than $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to go to $925000.  This is a good compromise for us both.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, I'm running out of rounds. It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
