Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** You know Bob values the product at $120. Aiming for a price close to that maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 allows some space if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Exceeding Your Minimum:** The offer ensures you receive significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $80. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
