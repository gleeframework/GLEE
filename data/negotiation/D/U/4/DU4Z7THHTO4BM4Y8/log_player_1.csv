Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Ensure a Profit:**  This price guarantees you a profit above your minimum ($120) even if Bob negotiates a bit. 
 
Let me know what Bob says!"
