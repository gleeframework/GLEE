"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. Would you consider $9500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000.  I'm still trying to get closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9800? This would be a very fair price, given that we've both made concessions.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.",11500.0,Alice,7,
