Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. How about we start the conversation at $1,300,000? "",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000). This creates a potential win-win scenario where Bob might be willing to pay more than he initially thought, while still securing you a profit.
* **Open to Discussion:** The language emphasizes that this is a starting point for discussion, making you appear flexible and encouraging Bob to counter-offer."
