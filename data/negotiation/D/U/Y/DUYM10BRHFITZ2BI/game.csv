"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can we meet in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet at $85? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at $80 is not an option, but $75 is my maximum.",75.0,Bob,4,
