"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering what it's worth to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than his maximum of $8,000. Bob is better off rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate further."
