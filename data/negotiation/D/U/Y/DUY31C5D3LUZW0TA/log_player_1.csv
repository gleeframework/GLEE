Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer positively and highlighting the value for Bob.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price that's a good deal for Bob, I increase the chances of a quick sale.  However, I also leave room to negotiate if Bob isn't satisfied with the initial offer.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with a new price.  If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering what it's worth to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is showing interest, and there's likely room for a counteroffer that would be more favorable to me.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still offering a discount to incentivize a sale.  I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer, balancing my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:** My goal is to find a compromise that benefits both of us. I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my commitment to a fair deal and emphasizing the value for Bob at this price.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while remaining firm on a price I'm comfortable with. It's a good starting point for further negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, as it's closer to your offer and I'm ready to buy right now. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000, it's getting closer.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Negotiating further might result in a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk that Bob will walk away or I'll lose valuable time. 
* **Time is money:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid further negotiation. It's important to consider the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate.

**Decision:** Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice.  I can always sell to John for a higher price, but securing a sale with Bob at $9,000 is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
