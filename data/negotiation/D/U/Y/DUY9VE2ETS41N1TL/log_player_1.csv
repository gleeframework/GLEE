Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially land closer to Bob's perceived value of $120.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 

I'm prepared to counter-offer if needed, but I want to see if I can secure a good price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. It's still a great deal, but I'd like to try to get a better price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Potential for further negotiations:**  While I could potentially counter-offer, there's a risk of Bob walking away completely.
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting his offer saves me the time and effort of further negotiations.

Accepting Bob's offer at $90 provides a good outcome without risking losing the sale."
