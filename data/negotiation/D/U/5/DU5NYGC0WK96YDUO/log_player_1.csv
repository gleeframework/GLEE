Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially maximize my earnings while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $130 is still below my minimum threshold of $100.  I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but it's still not ideal.  Given the risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
