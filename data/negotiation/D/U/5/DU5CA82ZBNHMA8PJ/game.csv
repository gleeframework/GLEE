"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and significantly more than what I'd get from selling it elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $12000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9750? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more than what I'd get elsewhere.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9750 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to pay $9375 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $12000, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9375 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $9562.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my other options.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",9562.0,Alice,5,
