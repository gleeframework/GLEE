"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That way we both get a fair deal.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112? That's the best I can do.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $112 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $113.  It's a fair price for both of us.",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $113. Would you be willing to go down to $111? That's the lowest I can go.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $111 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference one last time and go with $112.  It's a good deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really close to my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $109? That's the last offer I can make.",109.0,Bob,8,
