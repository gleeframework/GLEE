Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so $11,500 is a fair asking price.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You value the product at $12,000, so you're still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **It shows a willingness to negotiate:** By offering a price lower than your minimum, you're demonstrating flexibility.

This approach allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still keeping you in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a better price.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired $12,000. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,250. This price reflects a significant discount for you while still allowing me to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping the price from $11,500 to $11,250.
* **Fair Price:** This price is still above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum, demonstrating a balanced approach.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm aiming to meet ""in the middle"" between our previous offers, making this offer appear reasonable.

This counteroffer offers a balanced approach that might sway Bob while still keeping my goal of a higher price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we perhaps aim for $11,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would like to get closer to my desired $12,000, Bob's repeated insistence on $11,000 signals that he's unlikely to budge further.  Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome in this situation. It ensures I get my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, potentially leading to an even lower price."
