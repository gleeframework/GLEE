"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that high just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. $990,000 is a very tempting offer, but I'm still hoping to get it just a little lower. I'm willing to pay $995,000. This price is a fair compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",995000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $995,000. I'm willing to meet you at $998,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",998000.0,Alice,7,
