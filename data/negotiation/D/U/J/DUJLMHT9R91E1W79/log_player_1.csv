Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price you're happy with. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's true willingness to pay is unknown. A higher initial offer helps gauge his interest and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 (John). This safety net allows you to be bolder in your offer to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
