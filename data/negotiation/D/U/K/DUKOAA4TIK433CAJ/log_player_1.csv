"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for you. It's also important to acknowledge Bob's perspective and frame the price as fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's still below your target. You want to see if you can get closer to your ideal price. By rejecting the offer and counter-offering, you continue to control the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $950,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle on this one. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I can offer $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your target price of $950,000, and it's still a significant profit for you. It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
