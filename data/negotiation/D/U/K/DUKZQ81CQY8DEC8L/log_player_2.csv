Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your firm stance, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to make one final concession. If you're willing to meet me at $980,000, we have a deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to push for a lower price, getting the product for $980,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I risk her withdrawing the offer altogether."
