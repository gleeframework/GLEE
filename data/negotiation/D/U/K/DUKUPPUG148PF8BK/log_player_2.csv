"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob is willing to spend a maximum of $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $11,000.
* **John's Price:** John will sell the product for $12,000.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. He's still within his budget, and saves $1,000."
