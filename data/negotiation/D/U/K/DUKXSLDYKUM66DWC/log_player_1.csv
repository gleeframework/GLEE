"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  My initial offer is $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, creating a sense of opportunity.
* **Flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate, which increases the likelihood of a deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, which is my fallback value with John. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While I could accept and walk away with $1,500,000, I have 8 rounds left to potentially increase the price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation alive and aiming for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still committed to finding a price that reflects the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  Let's work together to make this happen.  "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000, a mid-point between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to emphasize its worth and justify the higher price.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using a collaborative tone, suggesting a willingness to find common ground. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully observe Bob's response. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll analyze his counter-counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* With every round, I'll be calculating the optimal price that maximizes my earnings while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."

* I'll try to be strategic in my counteroffer, aiming to find a price point where Bob is likely to accept, but also maximizes my profit.
* I'll keep in mind my fallback option with John, but I'm not ready to sell yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Alice. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose $1675000 as a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have only 4 rounds remaining, and I'm not sure if I can push for a higher price with so little time. 
* **Risk of Loss:** If I continue to reject, I risk Bob walking away, and I'll have to settle for John's offer, which is my minimum.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees me a profit of $175,000.  The risk of losing Bob as a buyer and being forced to sell to John at my minimum makes accepting the current offer the most prudent choice."
