Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be of great value."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  Offering it for more than $140 risks Bob rejecting the deal, leading you to sell it to John for $100. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
