"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counteroffer at $9,200. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, I need to make a profit, and $8,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counteroffer at $9,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",9000.0,Alice,5,
