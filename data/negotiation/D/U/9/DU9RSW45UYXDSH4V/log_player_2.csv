Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I need you to be serious about this negotiation. $8,250 is my absolute lowest - it's a steal for what you're getting.  Take it or leave it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is getting impatient and firm on her price. While a slightly better deal might be possible, the difference is getting smaller and risking the $10,000 price from John isn't worth it now."
