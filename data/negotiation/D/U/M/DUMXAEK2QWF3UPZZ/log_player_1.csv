Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a sense that there's some flexibility in the price while also ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than selling to John, I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a little closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a good deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer, but I'm still not able to meet you at $110. Would you be open to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and $105 is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer. It's a good compromise, and better than selling to John. I'm happy to accept his offer."
