"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate the starting price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,850.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement.",8850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,100, which is the lowest price I can accept without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not quite there at $9,100.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to go up to $8,950.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit worried that we might not reach an agreement. If we don't, I'll have to consider selling to John for $8,000, and I think you know that's not the best deal for either of us. So, let's make a final push and see if we can meet at $9,000. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  We've both come down in price, and I think we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle one last time and go with $8,900?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",8900.0,Bob,10,
