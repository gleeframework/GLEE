"Hello Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm offering the product to you for $1,500,000. I believe in its value and think this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum. I'm confident in the product's value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000, so that's my absolute floor.  How about we split the difference and close this out at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we settle at $1,225,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
