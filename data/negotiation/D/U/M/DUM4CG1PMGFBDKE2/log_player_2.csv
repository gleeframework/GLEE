"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $14,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could try to get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer, it's risky. If you reject her offer, you're guaranteeing yourself a price of $15,000 from John. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 and ensures you get the product."
