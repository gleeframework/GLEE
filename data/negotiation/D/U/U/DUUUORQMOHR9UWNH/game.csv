"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see some flexibility on your part.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet closer to the middle ground. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,300,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,375,000? This represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
