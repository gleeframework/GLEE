"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $700,000. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a price of $712,500.
