Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you and the potential for future profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer, and me to potentially come down a bit.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the price in terms of value to Bob, suggesting a potential for profit. This might make him more willing to negotiate. 

**Note:** This is just my first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how much I want to prioritize a deal with him over the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, there is still room for negotiation. I believe I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Exploring Options with Bob:**  I want to explore whether I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I will factor in the risk of Bob walking away and my potential to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and its potential for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still hold a firm price.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's value and potential for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Finalizing the Deal:**  I phrase it as a final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By making this counteroffer, I am showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. I hope to reach a deal with Bob, but I am prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still aiming to keep the cost lower. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between reflecting its value and staying within my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm starting to feel the pressure. Bob's continued low offers suggest he may be unwilling to meet my price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  I need to weigh the risk of losing a potential deal with Bob against the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make one more counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. If Bob rejects this final offer, I will sell to John to avoid further risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to keep costs down, but this offer is still too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $1,125,000. This is a final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  "", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to create urgency and emphasize my seriousness.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing flexibility while still holding my ground.
* **Consequences of Rejection:** I clearly state the consequences of Bob rejecting this offer, reminding him of the potential loss of the deal and my ability to sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

This is my last attempt to get a price closer to my desired range. If Bob rejects this offer, I will move forward with selling to John to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a mutually beneficial price. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1,090,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome. He's shown a pattern of offering prices below my minimum, and there's no guarantee he'll budge further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than anything I'm likely to get from Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob if the price was right, the risk of continued negotiation and the possibility of a lower price outweigh the potential benefits. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further time and effort."
