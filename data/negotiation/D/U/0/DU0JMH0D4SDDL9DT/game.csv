"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is a great product that's worth much more, but I'm trying to be flexible.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $7,750 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $7,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",7200.0,Bob,6,
