"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is a good compromise, and it's still within my budget of $150. It's a better deal than buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in more back-and-forth without a significant price decrease."
