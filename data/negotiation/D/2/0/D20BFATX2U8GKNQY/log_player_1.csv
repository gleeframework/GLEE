Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
