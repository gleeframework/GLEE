"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $15,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This still leaves room for you to gain some profit while ensuring a reasonable cost for me. I hope you'll consider this offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering its value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
