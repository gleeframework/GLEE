Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially given that I have a backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum asking price. Given the product's unique value, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,700,000. This offer reflects a compromise, and I hope you consider it seriously. "", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, and with the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low. Considering the product's unique value and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000, which is closer to your original asking price. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which is higher than Bob's offer. I don't want to risk losing that guaranteed sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
