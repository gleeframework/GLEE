Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate. This gives me some room to bargain while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a price of $140. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell to John and ensure I get the best possible outcome."
