# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,300,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go that far below my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my valuation of the product. What do you think?
