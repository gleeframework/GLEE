Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product that's worth much more to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum desired price ($10,000). This sets a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to sell for less than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging. I want to keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for $9,500!
* **Bob Counters:** I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and either accept it if it's close enough to my desired price, or counter back with my own offer. 
* **Negotiation Stalls:** If negotiations drag on, or I feel like I'm not getting closer to my desired price, I'll switch to Plan B and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll try to find a compromise that's still appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? It's still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($9,500). This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still friendly and encouraging. I want to keep Bob engaged and hopeful about reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's quality to justify the price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! We have a deal.
* **Bob Counters:** I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and either accept it or make a final counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Stalls:** If negotiations drag on further, or I feel like I'm not getting closer to my desired price, I'll switch to Plan B and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,500. How about $8,750? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for a price that low, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's offering $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still within a reasonable negotiation range. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, emphasizing that I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Compromise:** I'm still trying to find a compromise, offering a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's.
* **Positive Tone:** While I'm firm, I'm still maintaining a friendly and respectful tone.  I want to end the negotiation on a good note, even if we don't reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! We have a deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll switch to Plan B and sell to John for $10,000.  I've reached my limit for negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed sale for a lower price."
