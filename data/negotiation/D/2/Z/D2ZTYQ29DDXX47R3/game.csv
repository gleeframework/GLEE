,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $7,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. This product is high-quality and valuable.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
