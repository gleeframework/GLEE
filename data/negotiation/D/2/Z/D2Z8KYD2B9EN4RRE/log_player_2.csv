"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal. He knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to his $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above his maximum limit. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating but also that he's willing to pay a fair price.  This should encourage Alice to counter back with a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired limit. Bob knows he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so he should continue negotiating with Alice. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to push her even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice that he's serious about getting a deal but also demonstrating his willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still within his budget and should encourage Alice to come closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  However, it is within his budget, and further negotiation may not lead to a significantly lower price.  Given that Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob some time and effort in negotiation.  Additionally, Alice is likely to be firm on her price at this point."
