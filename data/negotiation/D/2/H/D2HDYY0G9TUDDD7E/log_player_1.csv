"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $17,000 is still a good deal for me, considering my minimum price of $15,000. This allows for some negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. 
* **John as a backup:** I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it indicates he's still interested.  I can counteroffer and attempt to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500 to make this work.  This price still leaves me some room to make a profit and allows you to get a good deal on a valuable product. Let's try to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and framing this as a good deal for him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $15,500 is still a good price for me, and there's still room to negotiate slightly if Bob pushes back. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I am still unable to meet you at $15,500. I would like to propose $14,000 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not there yet:**  $14,000 is closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired outcome.
* **John's offer is still a better option:**  I can get a higher price from John without further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially get a higher counteroffer from him in the next round. 

**However, I'm carefully considering the time factor.  If we continue negotiating, there's a risk that I'll run out of rounds before reaching a satisfactory price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go down to $14,500 to finalize this deal. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to sell the product and you to get a valuable item at a good rate.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing risk and reward:** I'm making a small concession to Bob to keep him at the table while still remaining close to my minimum price.
* **Time constraint:** We are now in round 5, so I need to move closer to a deal quickly. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fair price"" aspect to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Finality:**  I'm suggesting this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency.

**If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John in the next round to ensure a guaranteed sale.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $14,000 as my final offer. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 6, and there is not much time left to negotiate with Bob. 
* **No significant improvement:** Bob's final offer is only $500 higher than his previous one, which is still lower than my desired outcome. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a higher price than Bob's offer, and it secures a sale without further risk or delay.

While I'm slightly disappointed not to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible and secure option at this point."
