"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her, getting closer to her $8,000 value. If negotiations fail, you can always fall back on John's offer."
