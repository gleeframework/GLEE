"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.**  Bob saves $150,000 by accepting Alice's offer ($1,500,000 - $1,350,000 = $150,000).
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000. 

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
