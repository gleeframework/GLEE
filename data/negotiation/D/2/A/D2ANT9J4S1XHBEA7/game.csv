"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, the price of $1,500,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the potential of this product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation, as I'm ready to buy now, and you'd be getting the price you need to move this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
