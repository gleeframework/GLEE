"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a fair price, given the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $105 is a bit better, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at this price.",100.0,Alice,5,
