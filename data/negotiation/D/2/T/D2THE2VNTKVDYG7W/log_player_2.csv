"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her. This gives us some room to negotiate and hopefully arrive at a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than my ideal.  There's a good chance that Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she rejected my previous counteroffer.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my ideal.  This is also a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current one, which might increase the chance of her accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer to my budget. Since I'm able to get the product for $1,000,000 from John, I'm going to try one more time to negotiate with Alice before resorting to that option.  There's still a chance that she might accept a lower price after rejecting my previous counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering Alice my absolute maximum price, which is the same as what John is offering. If Alice rejects this, I will buy from John. There is no point in negotiating further as I have reached my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and her latest offer is still higher than my maximum. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. It guarantees a purchase within my budget and avoids further negotiation that is unlikely to yield a better price."
