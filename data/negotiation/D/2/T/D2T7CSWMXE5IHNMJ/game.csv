"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but there's still a gap between our valuations.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While your offer is tempting, I'm confident this product can bring you even greater returns.  Would you consider $860,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",860000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $820,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",820000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems like we're on the same page about the product's potential. How about we settle this right now at $840,000?  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",840000.0,Alice,7,
