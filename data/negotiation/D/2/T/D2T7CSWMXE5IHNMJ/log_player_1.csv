"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but there's still a gap between our valuations.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches John's, I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to try and capture some of that value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While your offer is tempting, I'm confident this product can bring you even greater returns.  Would you consider $860,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $820,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to move upward in price, and we're still significantly above John's offer. There's room for negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're on the same page about the product's potential. How about we settle this right now at $840,000?  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 840000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm setting a firm tone this round while still leaving some room for negotiation. This offer is strong but also reflects a willingness to compromise.  By saying it's my final offer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept without further back and forth."
