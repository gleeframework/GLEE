"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $1,900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider a price of $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more affordable. Would you be open to $1,400,000? I believe this price reflects a balance between its value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
