"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking for $200. You want to save as much money as possible. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $175 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $185? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $185
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You are still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $185 is closer to your ideal price, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your $175 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm getting closer to your price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $180?  That's the most I can realistically do."", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
