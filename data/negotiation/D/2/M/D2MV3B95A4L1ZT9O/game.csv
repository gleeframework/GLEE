"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it can bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $600,000. How about $575,000?",575000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $650,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $620,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",620000.0,Alice,7,
