"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is my final offer.  This product is worth significantly more to you, and I believe this price reflects that value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,050,000. I think we're getting close to the product's actual value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'll counter with $975,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 just isn't enough.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'll counter with $987,500. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",987500.0,Bob,8,
