"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  I can go as low as $950,000.  This is my final offer, as it's a significant discount already.",950000.0,Alice,5,
