(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob is looking to save money and John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there is no advantage to buying from Alice. Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John to keep his options open for potentially finding a better deal in the future."
