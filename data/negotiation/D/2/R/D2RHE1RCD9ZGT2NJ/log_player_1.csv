Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, while still securing a good profit for you.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a fallback option."
