"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant improvement on your previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair compromise and a good step towards reaching an agreement.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
