"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's opening offer is much higher than both your maximum price and the product's value to her. There's significant room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work your way up.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will give you a better understanding of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price.
* **Backup Plan:**  You always have the option of going with John for $800,000, so there's no need to be overly aggressive right away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant improvement on your previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down significantly, $900,000 is still above your $800,000 limit and leaves less room for negotiation before you have to consider John's offer.
* **Gauge Flexibility:** By rejecting again, you can see how much further Alice is willing to go and if a deal within your budget is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Position:** This counteroffer shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still leaving some room for negotiation within your budget. 
* **Testing Resolve:**  Offering $750,000 will reveal if Alice is genuinely interested in making a deal or if she's fixed on a price closer to $900,000. 
* **John Option:** Keep in mind, you still have the option of going with John's $800,000 offer if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair compromise and a good step towards reaching an agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  $850,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Negotiating Position:** You're in a good position now. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you're very close to your fallback option.
* **Final Push:** By rejecting again, you're signaling to Alice that she needs to come down to your price point if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  You've reached your limit.  This message clearly states your final offer and the consequence of not accepting it.
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning ""other options"" (John's offer), you're subtly putting a time constraint on Alice, encouraging her to make a decision quickly.
* **Clean Break:**  This approach avoids a drawn-out back-and-forth and provides a clear resolution for both parties."
