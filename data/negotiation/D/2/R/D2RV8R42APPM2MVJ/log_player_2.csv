{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and gives us a good starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a reasonable price considering my initial counteroffer. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm not sure I can get it much lower.  I don't want to risk her getting frustrated and backing out of the deal."
