"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's $1,000 less than its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer is decent, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
