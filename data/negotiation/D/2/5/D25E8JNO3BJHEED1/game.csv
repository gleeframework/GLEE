"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $12000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'm currently only able to offer $10500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the value in this product,  $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $11000. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to add a small premium to account for the value it brings. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $11250. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",11250.0,Alice,5,
