I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and is still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too low.  It's important to recognize that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on that guaranteed profit."
