"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose all the details right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $15000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000, which gives you a significant potential upside. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $15000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.
