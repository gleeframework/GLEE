Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $120, which is your minimum.
* **It's not too high:** A starting price of $150 gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like you're being unreasonable.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps build rapport and makes the offer feel less transactional. 

By starting with a reasonable price and being friendly, you increase the chances of Bob accepting your offer or at least starting a productive negotiation. Remember, you can always lower your price later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. You can use this opportunity to explore if Bob is willing to meet you halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a reason for the price (fair profit, value of the product) makes it feel more justified.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  It's important to remember your goal is to maximize your profit.  Since John is offering $120, which is higher than Bob's current offer, selling to John is the best option at this point.  This guarantees you a profit and saves you the time and effort of further negotiation with Bob."
