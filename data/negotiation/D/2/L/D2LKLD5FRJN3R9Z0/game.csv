"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still hesitant to go up to $850000, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $825000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.
