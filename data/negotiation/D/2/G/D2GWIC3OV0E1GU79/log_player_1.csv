Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable enough to at least consider my offer, and I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, it doesn't meet my needs. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I want to stay in the negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away too much. I believe this is a fair and reasonable counteroffer that could lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that further negotiation will just drag this out.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and ensures a swift transaction.  It's time to move on."
