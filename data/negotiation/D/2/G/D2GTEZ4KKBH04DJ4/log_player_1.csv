Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for significantly more than Bob's perceived value increases the chance of reaching a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""unique value"" and ""potential for return,"" you frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Open for negotiation:**  The tone is not a hard sell. By inviting Bob's thoughts, you leave room for negotiation and potential counter-offers, maximizing your potential gain.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a deal significantly above your minimum and Bob's perceived value.**
2. **If Bob rejects the initial high price, you can negotiate down and still likely secure a price well above $800,000.** 
3. **Worst-case scenario, you sell to John at your guaranteed price.**"
