"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects a significant discount from its true value to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
