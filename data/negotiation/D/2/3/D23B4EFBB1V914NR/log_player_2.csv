"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it for $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,150,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous offer, it's still more expensive than what Bob can get from John. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is still higher than what Bob can get from John, but it's closer to his desired price.  There's a chance Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more from John.  Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product and save some money compared to John's price."
