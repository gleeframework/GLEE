"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows me to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 feels a bit low for me, considering the value you've described.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's potential, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise.  While it's higher than my initial counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,500,000.  It also shows that Alice is willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John."
