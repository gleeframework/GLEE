"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 feels a bit low for me, considering the value you've described.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's potential, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
