"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession for a quick sale.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
