"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $18,000 for the product. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair considering my limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and my overall budget. Let's see if we can agree on this number.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, $14,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
