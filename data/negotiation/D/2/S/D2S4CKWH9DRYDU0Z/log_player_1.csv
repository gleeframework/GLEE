I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,400,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a good profit margin for me. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to accept $1,350,000 for the product."
