Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $97.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While we could try to negotiate further, $97.50 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's close enough to our target price that it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
