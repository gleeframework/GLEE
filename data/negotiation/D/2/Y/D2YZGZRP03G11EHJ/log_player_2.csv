# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price tailored just for you. Given its immense value and your appreciation for it, we're extending this opportunity to acquire the item for $14000. This is a special offer considering its worth to both of us. We believe this price reflects the quality and benefits you'll receive, while ensuring a fair transaction for us. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm excited about the offer, but I have to consider my budget. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, I'm hoping to negotiate a better price. However, Alice's offer of $14,000 is still a bit above my target of $12,000. I'll have to think carefully about this.

For now, I'll reject Alice's offer and explore other options.
