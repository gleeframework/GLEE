"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a better price, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is within my acceptable range.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it. Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
