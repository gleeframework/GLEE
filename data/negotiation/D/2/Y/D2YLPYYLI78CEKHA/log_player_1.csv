Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" you subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""suggesting"" and ""What do you think?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in a negotiation. 

**Goal:** The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. While there's a risk he might reject the offer, the potential for a higher return outweighs settling for your guaranteed $1,500,000 upfront."
