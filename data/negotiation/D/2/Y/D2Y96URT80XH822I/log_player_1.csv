Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $950000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal with a counteroffer."
