{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price ($180) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone in the message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob to pique his interest.

This offer sets the stage for a negotiation where I can adjust my price based on Bob's response, while still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, I believe I can still get a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my initial asking price of $180."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $160 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $170? It's a good compromise and still represents a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $170, which is closer to my initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob that the price still represents a good deal for him.

This counteroffer continues the negotiation by showing I'm willing to be flexible but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $165? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $165 is not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
