Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about we compromise at $940,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset for you. "", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $930,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000

At this point, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and Bob is unlikely to budge much further. Accepting his offer of $930,000 is the best course of action."
