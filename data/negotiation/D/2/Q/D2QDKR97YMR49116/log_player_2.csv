# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $11,500, which is a good deal, but you can still do better. Rejecting her offer means you can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is still within your budget and ensures you get the product."
