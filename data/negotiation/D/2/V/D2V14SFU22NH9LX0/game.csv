"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850,000 for it. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $825,000, which is a good middle ground for us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I still need to get as much as I can for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",835000.0,Alice,5,
