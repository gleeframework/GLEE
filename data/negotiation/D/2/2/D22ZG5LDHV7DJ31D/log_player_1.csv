"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is seriously interested and to give me room to negotiate down. I'll keep in mind John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and it gives me some wiggle room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $15,000.  I'm accepting this offer to secure a better deal and avoid risking further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in talks."
