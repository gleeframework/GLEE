"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price. There's no point in further negotiation with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed sale with John."
