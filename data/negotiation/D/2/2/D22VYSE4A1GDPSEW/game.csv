,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,200? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another offer. How about $9,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,
