"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could consider letting it go for $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
