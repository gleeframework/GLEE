"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the current market.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
