"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still above my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm a bit of a savvy shopper, and I'm trying to get the best deal possible.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500. Can you meet me there?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $8,500 is still too far below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits everyone.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure we're getting any closer to a deal at $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, which would be $8,500. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you accept that price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be firm on your price, and I appreciate your directness. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,250. It's closer to your price, and it allows me to make a profit on the deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,500. I'm willing to give you a bit more room for negotiation, so I'll come down to $8,200. That's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",8200.0,Bob,8,
