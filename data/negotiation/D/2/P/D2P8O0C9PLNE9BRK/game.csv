"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good value for both of us. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $8,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can manage. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,6,
