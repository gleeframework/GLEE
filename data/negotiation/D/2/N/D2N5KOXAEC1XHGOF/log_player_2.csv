I look forward to discussing how this product can benefit your business further. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with this offer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Therefore, it makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
