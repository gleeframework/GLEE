"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value, and also gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get at least $15,000 for the product to make it worthwhile. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm prepared to sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which reflects the product's unique value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but $14,000 is still below my minimum. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more, but if he won't budge, I'm ready to take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer,  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to offer $13,500 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already reached my final offer and I'm not sure if he'll come up any higher.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
