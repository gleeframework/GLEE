"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay a premium and how much he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, and it's still below the product's worth to him. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, showing some flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiations in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below the product's worth to him.  I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm confident I can get a better price. I will try again with another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,550,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above the $1,500,000 minimum I'm willing to accept. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not in a hurry and I'd rather keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1525000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,525,000. This is a small concession, but it shows I'm still willing to negotiate and potentially get a deal done with Bob. It's also a price that is closer to the $1,500,000 I'd get from John, so if Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price. Even though I have two rounds left, it's not worth risking losing this deal to get a slightly better price.  It's important to be realistic and know when to accept a good offer."
