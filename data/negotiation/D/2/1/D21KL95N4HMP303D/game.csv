"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
