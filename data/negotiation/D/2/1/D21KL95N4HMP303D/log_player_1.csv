Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While Bob is slowly coming up in price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number I find acceptable. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk a prolonged negotiation with Bob that might not end favorably."
