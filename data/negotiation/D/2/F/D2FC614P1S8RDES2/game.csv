,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about $90? It's a fair price that's within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $105 and $90. I'll sell the product to you for $97.50. It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, but still a good deal for you. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,
