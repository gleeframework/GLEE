Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $125. Would you be open to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.5?  That's a very competitive price for this quality."",
""product_price"": 132.5
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $132.5 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $128.75.  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $128.75 is a solid deal. It's significantly higher than my minimum and John's offer, making it a good outcome at this point in the negotiation."
