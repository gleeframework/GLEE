"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There's room for Alice to lower the price as the product is worth $800,000 to her.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering it's closer to Alice's value of $800,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much, while also giving you a good chance of getting a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price by making another counteroffer.  While buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's offer and your previous counteroffer.  It's a reasonable middle ground that demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below $950,000.  This also gives Alice a chance to come down further from her last offer without feeling like she's conceding too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your previous counteroffer. However, it is still within the range of what you are willing to pay. By rejecting her offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price. Remember, you have 10 rounds to close the deal, and each round provides an opportunity to improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.  This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to move closer to her asking price while maintaining a good deal for yourself.  It also leaves room for her to counteroffer without having to drop her price too drastically, making it more likely that she will accept this offer.  We are halfway through the negotiations, so it's important to find a price that is acceptable to both parties to avoid having to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $996,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $996,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your upper limit, but it's still higher than your desired price.  It's worth trying to get a better deal.  It's also important to remember that the further the negotiation goes, the more likely it is that Alice might be more flexible with her price. You have 3 more rounds, so it's worth trying to get a better price, especially since you have the option to buy from John if the deal with Alice falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a final push to try and secure a price within your budget.  It's a significant compromise from your previous counteroffer, but still a better deal than Alice's latest offer.  With only 2 rounds left, you need to be decisive while still leaving room for Alice to accept without feeling pressured. It's a calculated risk, but it's worth it to see if you can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your budget, but it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  You only have one round left, and it's highly unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a slightly higher price, but it guarantees you get the product and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice in the final round.  It's the most logical choice at this point in the negotiation."
