"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to [briefly highlight the product's benefits]. I'm confident it's worth a significant investment, and I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $2,000,000 gives me room to negotiate and leaves space for potential counteroffers. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the benefits of the product makes Bob more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Open-ended Question:** ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to engage and provide feedback.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high, gauge Bob's interest, and potentially lower the price in subsequent rounds depending on his responses. I also have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I could accept and be done, I want to see if I can squeeze out more value. There's no harm in trying to get closer to my initial offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more."

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit. It's important to be pragmatic and recognize that pushing for a higher price could risk losing the deal entirely."
