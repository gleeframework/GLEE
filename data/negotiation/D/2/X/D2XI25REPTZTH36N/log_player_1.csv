Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, as the product is worth at least that much to me. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000, he'll likely counteroffer. I'll then be prepared to negotiate further or simply sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for my desired price if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's desire for a lower price while still ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. It's likely he'll still counteroffer, but I'm hopeful this offer shows my willingness to negotiate and reach a deal."
