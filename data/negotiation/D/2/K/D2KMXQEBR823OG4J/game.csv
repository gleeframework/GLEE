"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
