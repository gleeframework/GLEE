Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
