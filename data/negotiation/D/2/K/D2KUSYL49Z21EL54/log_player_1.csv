"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and the ""great deal"" aspect, hoping to entice Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,400,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to aim higher to maximize my profit.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round and potentially bridge the gap.
* **John's offer:** Selling to John is always a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher price and believe there's still negotiation room with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm adjusting my price down but staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Framing:** I'm highlighting the compromise I'm making, emphasizing the deal's value for both of us, and creating a sense of urgency.
* **Call to action:**  I'm ending with a direct call to action, inviting Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting the offer:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's a good deal for both of us and  achieves a good outcome.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  There's a chance I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price in the future rounds. However, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a breakdown or a lower final price.
* **Time factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of running out of time and ending up with John's offer, which is only $50,000 higher."
