"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, and I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
