"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a fantastic opportunity for your company. My asking price is $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is too high. While there's a chance Alice might lower her price during negotiations, it's still too risky to accept in the first round.  Bob can try to get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is still good for you, as it's well above your value for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  That's a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your company.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's preferred price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get closer to his target price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while I get a good price. Let's try to reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}
