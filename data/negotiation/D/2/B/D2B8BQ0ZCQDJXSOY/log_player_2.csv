"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  I understand it's a significant investment, but I believe the product will be very beneficial for your business.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $800,000."
