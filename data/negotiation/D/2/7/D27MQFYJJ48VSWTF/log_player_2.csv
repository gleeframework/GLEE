"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to us, I propose a starting price of $11000. This allows both parties to benefit from the transaction while ensuring we receive a fair return for our investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. There are 9 more rounds, and Bob can use this time to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower range for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  He acknowledges the value of the product but emphasizes his budget constraints. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  He signals that he's willing to negotiate further, leaving room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $10500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:**  Alice has come down from $11,000 to $10,500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Close to Target:**  $10,500 is within Bob's desired range (under $12,000) and  closer to his initial counteroffer of $9,500. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or rejecting future offers. Accepting now secures a good deal within his budget and avoids potential delays or losing the opportunity altogether."
