# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
