Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know the product is worth $120 to Bob, giving you a good negotiating position.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Benefit:** Offering it at $100 lets Bob feel like he's getting a deal (saving $20), making him more likely to accept. 
* **Maximizing Your Profit:**  This price point gets you the best possible price while still ensuring a sale. Offering it any higher risks Bob rejecting it and you having to settle for $80 from John."
