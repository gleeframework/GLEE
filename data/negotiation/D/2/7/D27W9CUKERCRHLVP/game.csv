"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000? I feel this is a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're able to continue negotiating. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
