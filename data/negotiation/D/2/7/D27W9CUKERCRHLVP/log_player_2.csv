"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're able to continue negotiating. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

``` 

This seems like a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Price:** You're getting the product for $250,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly less than John's offer. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away from the deal. 
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have five rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and you risk running out of time."
