""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the higher price without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""what are your thoughts"" signal your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

By starting at $15,000, Alice leaves room to potentially:

* Secure a price above both her minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* Negotiate down slightly and still achieve a favorable outcome. 

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed backup at her minimum acceptable price."
