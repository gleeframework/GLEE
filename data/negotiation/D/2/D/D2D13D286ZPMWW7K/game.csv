"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $950000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to your business.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it and your asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business and my initial asking price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows me to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
