Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By starting at $12,000, you leave room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's a fair price:**  While Bob values the product at $15,000, $12,000 is still a significant profit for you.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale.  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response, but always be prepared to walk away and sell to John if you don't think you can get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to you.  You have a good chance of getting a higher price if you counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price,  $9,750 is a good compromise.  It's a fair amount more than selling to John and still leaves Bob with a good deal. It's time to close the deal!"
