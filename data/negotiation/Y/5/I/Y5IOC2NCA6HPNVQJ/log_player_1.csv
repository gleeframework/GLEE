{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to buy. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob, offering it slightly above that might entice him.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The safety net of John buying at $150 provides leverage. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $145 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle."
