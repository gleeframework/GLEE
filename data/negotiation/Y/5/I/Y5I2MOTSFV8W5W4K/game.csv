,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much on the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is my bottom line, as it's the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile.  If you're still interested, let's close this now.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
