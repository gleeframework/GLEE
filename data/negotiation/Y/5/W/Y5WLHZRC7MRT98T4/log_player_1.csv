I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but it's taking too long and we only have a few rounds left.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price, and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
