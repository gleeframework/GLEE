Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could push Bob further, his ""final offer"" language suggests he's nearing his limit. Accepting $1,230,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of him walking away and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
