"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit below my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your budget considerations.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is closer to the product's value to you and also within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To show you I'm flexible, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $880,000, which is closer to the product's value to you. This is a fair price, and I believe we are close to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to reach a final number in the next few rounds.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I want to see this deal through.  How about $890,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise considering the product's value.",890000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go up to $885,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",885000.0,Bob,8,
