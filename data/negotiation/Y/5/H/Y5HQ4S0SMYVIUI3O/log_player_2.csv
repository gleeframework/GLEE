* **Flexibility:** The counteroffer leaves room to compromise if Alice doesn't accept the initial price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000.

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price point, and while I could potentially try to negotiate further, it's not a huge difference.  It's worth accepting this offer, especially considering that I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000 if I want to continue negotiating."
