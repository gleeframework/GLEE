,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $80.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",80.0,Bob,4,
