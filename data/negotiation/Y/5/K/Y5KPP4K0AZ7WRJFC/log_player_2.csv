"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which is a fair deal considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his target price of $10,000, and he has plenty of room to negotiate.  He should try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm genuinely interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $10000. How about we meet at $14000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his target price of $10,000. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his budget. There are still several rounds left, and he can always buy from John if he doesn't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and still gives you a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $12000. However, considering the value I place on the product, I need to make a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's close to his target price, and there are still several rounds left in the negotiation.  He should try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,500, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but I need to make a bit more. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value I place on the product. How about we try $14500? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer of $14,500 is too high, and he's already had a few rounds where she hasn't budged much.  He's getting closer to his goal with each round, but it's unlikely Alice will come down much further.  Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees he gets the product at his target price."
