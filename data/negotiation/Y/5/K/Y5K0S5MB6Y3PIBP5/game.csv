"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1300000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1900000. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you've done your research, but I'm not convinced the market value is that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1750000. It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a more realistic reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

It's a fair price, and I think it's a price that reflects the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options as well.
