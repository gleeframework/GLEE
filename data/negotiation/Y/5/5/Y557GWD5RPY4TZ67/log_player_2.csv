# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.

Bob should reject the offer.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000, which is still a great deal for a unique product like this. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, it's a better deal than buying from John, and while there's always the possibility Alice will go lower, there's also the risk she'll walk away or increase her offer.  Bob needs to weigh the risk of losing a good deal versus the chance of potentially saving a few hundred dollars.  Given that Alice has already dropped her price significantly, it's likely this is her final offer."
