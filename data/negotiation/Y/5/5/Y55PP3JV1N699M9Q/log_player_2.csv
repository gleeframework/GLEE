Given its value and potential impact on your projects, I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $14,000. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best possible deal while maximizing the return on investment for us. I look forward to discussing how this product can benefit your endeavors further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase from John at your desired price point."
