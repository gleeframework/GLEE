"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $120, Bob's offer of $112.50 is a reasonable compromise.  We're nearing the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
