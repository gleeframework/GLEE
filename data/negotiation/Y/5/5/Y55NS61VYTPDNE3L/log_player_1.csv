{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm looking to get $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a good middle ground. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not going to sell it for my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum price of $8,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering Bob's potential value for the product.  It's also a good compromise, and I'd rather make a sale than risk further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or even a rejection."
