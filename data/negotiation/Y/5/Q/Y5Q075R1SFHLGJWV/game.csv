"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests and allows for a successful transaction.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial pricing reflects the true potential and scarcity of this product. Let's find a middle ground â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price offers a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but need to see some movement on the price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to consider a significant reduction to $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession on my end, reflecting my desire to find a solution for us both.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making an effort to find common ground, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,600,000 is still out of my range. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $1,000,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the offer, and I'm encouraged that we're finding common ground.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, especially considering the product's potential value and our desire to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm glad we're making progress, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my financial capacity.  I'm sticking to my offer of $1,000,000. This is a price I can reasonably afford, and I believe it's fair considering the value I place on this product. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to see a bit more movement on your end.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
