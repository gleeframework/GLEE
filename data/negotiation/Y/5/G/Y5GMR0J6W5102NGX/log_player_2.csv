Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we offer the product at $90? It's still a great deal considering its value to you.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
