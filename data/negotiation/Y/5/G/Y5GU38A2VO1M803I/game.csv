"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and would still allow you to make a profit with this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $875000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price",875000.0,Bob,4,
