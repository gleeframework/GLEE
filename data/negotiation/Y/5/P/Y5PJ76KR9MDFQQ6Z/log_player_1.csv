Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for Bob while also highlighting my own needs. This builds trust and sets the stage for a potentially productive negotiation.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Room to negotiate:**  Starting high leaves space for counteroffers and concessions without immediately jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding immediate rejection:**  Offering a significant discount increases the likelihood of Bob considering the offer, which keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Setting a tone:**  The message emphasizes a potential win-win scenario, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is the maximum I am comfortable with, considering my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a compromise that benefits both of us.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $975,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints, but also emphasize the value of the product. This helps maintain a positive and cooperative tone.
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement. It also positions me to potentially get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price with further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given it careful consideration, but I'm still not able to meet you at $975,000. I'm willing to pay up to $960,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is within your range of acceptance. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of going through multiple rounds with Bob is too high.  It's unlikely that Bob will drastically increase his offer, and I don't want to waste time on a protracted negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids any further uncertainty."
