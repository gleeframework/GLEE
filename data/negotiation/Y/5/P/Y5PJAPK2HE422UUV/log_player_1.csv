Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.  
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it subtly implies added value by stating ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment.""
* **Backup Plan:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for your minimum acceptable price if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. He might be willing to pay slightly more than $12,000, but $18,000 is a good starting point to test the waters."
