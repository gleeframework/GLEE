Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $1,025,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000, but I'll throw in some extras, like a free maintenance package worth $25,000. That way, you'll get a great deal, and I'll still make a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the offer of a maintenance package is tempting, it's still above your target price.  You can try to negotiate a lower price or stick to your original target and try to get a better deal from Alice or John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the extra value with the maintenance package, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
