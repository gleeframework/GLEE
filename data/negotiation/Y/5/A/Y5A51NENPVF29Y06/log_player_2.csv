"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you should try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting her initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a range where she might be willing to negotiate. This initial counteroffer shows that I am serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her price from the previous round. While it's still above my target, there's room for negotiation. I'm not willing to buy at this price yet. Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer again and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, but still staying below my maximum.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also want to secure a good deal. Since John is offering the product at this price, it's a reasonable starting point for negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is consistently increasing her price, and we're already halfway through the negotiations.  It's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement within my desired price range.  To avoid potentially losing out entirely, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
