Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if vague like ""unique value"") can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating you're ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" you signal willingness to negotiate without seeming desperate.
* **Alternative Buyer (Implicit):** By mentioning ""listing it publicly,"" you subtly imply there are other interested parties, creating a sense of urgency without explicitly revealing John's offer.

**Goal:**  

The goal is to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) while staying below John's guaranteed offer ($15,000). Ideally, you'd aim for somewhere between $16,000 - $18,000 if possible."
