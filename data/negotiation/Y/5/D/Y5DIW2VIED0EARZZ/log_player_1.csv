Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and would be highly valuable to your portfolio. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000 before exploring other options."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  Offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) would likely result in immediate rejection. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies that John is waiting in the wings, which might push Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows for potential negotiation downward, closer to Bob's valuation, while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:** John guarantees you $1,500,000. By starting high with Bob, you maximize your chances of exceeding that amount. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring you don't miss out on John's guaranteed offer."
