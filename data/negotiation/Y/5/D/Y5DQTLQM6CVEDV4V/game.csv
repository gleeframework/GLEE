"Thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to spend. How about we consider $1600000 for the product?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While $1600000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
