Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, knowing it's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price. It also sets the tone that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $75 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
