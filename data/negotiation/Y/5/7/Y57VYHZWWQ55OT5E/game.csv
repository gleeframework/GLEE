"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,000. I know it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial asking price.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. This gives us both a decent deal and keeps things moving forward.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,500. I'm trying to get as close to my target as possible, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me.",7500.0,Bob,6,
