"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,500 is too low for me, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial asking price.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his willingness to meet halfway, $8,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground in the next round, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. This gives us both a decent deal and keeps things moving forward."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,500. I'm trying to get as close to my target as possible, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

I'm selling the product to John. Bob's offer of $7,500 is too low, and I'm not confident we can reach an agreement that's fair for both of us. John is offering my minimum price, so it's the best option at this point."
