"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.  I'm also keeping in mind my floor price of $1,500,000, which I can always get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price significantly from the first round, but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to continue negotiating. I'm also considering that the longer we negotiate, the more likely I am to lose interest and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still too low. I want to see if he's willing to go higher. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time only slightly. I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I'm getting closer to accepting his offer, but also that I'm not willing to budge too much further. It's a bit of a gamble, but with only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough. We're at a critical juncture - with only 4 rounds left, I need to start closing the deal. However, selling to John would guarantee my minimum price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer in the next round.  If he doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This is my final offer to Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John. I'm hoping this last offer is enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm more likely to get a better deal from John than continue negotiating with Bob.  With only 2 rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get a significantly better price from Bob. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
