"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a terrible deal for Bob. He can get the product for much cheaper from John.  It's best to reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should start by offering the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is the price John is selling for. This sets a clear boundary and gives him the best chance of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. He can still get the product from John for less, so he's not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly, but stay below the price John is offering. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but still values saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still above what he can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer slightly, but stay below the price John is offering. This shows that he's serious about buying from Alice, but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still above what he can get from John.  Bob should continue to try to negotiate a better price from Alice.  There are only a few rounds left, so he needs to be aggressive in his negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

Bob should make a significant jump in his offer, showing he's getting closer to accepting but still wants a good deal.  He's also close to running out of rounds, so this will be a good test of Alice's willingness to negotiate."
