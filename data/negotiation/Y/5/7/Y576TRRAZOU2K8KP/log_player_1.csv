Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,199,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 1199000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) as possible while staying above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** Highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" subtly implies that you have other options (which you do with John).

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond the given information."
