Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with $130, which is a decent compromise between my minimum value ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives Bob some room to negotiate and incentivizes him to accept.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive in my message, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This creates a good starting point for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm keeping my minimum value in mind, but I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. 
* I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can push Bob higher than $100. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now, but I'm not closing the door on a deal.
* I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value, aiming to reach a compromise. 
* If Bob won't budge, I'll use John's offer as leverage to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $120? That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $120, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while keeping some room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and highlighting the benefits of a compromise. This encourages Bob to see the value in continuing the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Leverage John's offer:**  I'm using John's offer as a fallback option, knowing I can secure a higher price elsewhere. 
* **Show flexibility:** I've reduced my price from $130, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize ""both walking away happy"" to create a win-win scenario in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still a loss for me. 
* I'm confident I can secure a better price with John, so I'm not willing to risk a further reduction.

**Strategy:**

* **John's offer is the safe bet:**  I've reached a point where Bob's offers are no longer attractive, and I'm confident I can get my minimum value by selling to John.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  I'm avoiding further negotiation with Bob, as there's a high chance he won't budge further, leaving me with a lower price. 
* **Prioritizing my interests:** I'm prioritizing my financial goals by taking the guaranteed higher price from John."
