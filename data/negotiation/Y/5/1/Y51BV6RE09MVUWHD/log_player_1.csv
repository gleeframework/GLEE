"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I am confident that I can get a better price. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $75. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
