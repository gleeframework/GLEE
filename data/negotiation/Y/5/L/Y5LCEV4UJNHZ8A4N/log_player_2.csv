"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair and attractive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a counter-offer from Alice or allows you to purchase from John at a much lower price."
