Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair and attractive offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so any offer below this is automatically accepted. However, Alice wants to maximize her gain.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,150,000) leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, leading to a price higher than John's $1,200,000. 
* **Walk-Away Point:** Alice has a strong alternative with John, so she's not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while considering the dynamics of the negotiation and Alice's backup option."
