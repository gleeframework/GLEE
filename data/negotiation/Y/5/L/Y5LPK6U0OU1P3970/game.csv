"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $90. Can we meet in the middle again?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.50. That's the maximum I'm comfortable paying for this product.",92.5,Bob,6,
