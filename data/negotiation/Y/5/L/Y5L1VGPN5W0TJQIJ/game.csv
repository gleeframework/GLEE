"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $180 for it. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find the product a good home, $100 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you do $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product. How about we split the difference and meet at $135?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $125? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
