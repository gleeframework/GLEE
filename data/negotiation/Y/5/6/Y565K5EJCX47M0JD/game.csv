"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $140. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  $140 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
