"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that considers the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,400,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,3,
