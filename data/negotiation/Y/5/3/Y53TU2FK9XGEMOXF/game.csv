"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $16,000?  This would be a fair price reflecting the product's worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $8,000 is a fair price given my current budget. I would like to stick to this figure. If you could meet me halfway, that would be great.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront.  $8,000 is simply too low, and I wouldn't be doing myself justice selling it at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement on your end. How about $14,000? This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal, but I still feel that $8,000 is the most I can realistically afford. I hope you can meet me at this price point. If not, I will consider purchasing the product from John.",8000.0,Bob,6,
