{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers incredible value, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14999 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $8,000, there's room to negotiate above that. Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $14,999 feels like a significant discount compared to a rounded $15,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Backup Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides a strong safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
