"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $925,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $935,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",935000.0,Alice,5,
