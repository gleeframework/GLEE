$115 is still more than your budget.  You can try a counteroffer closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

Alice is still above your budget. While $110 is closer, it's not worth it to risk further negotiation when you can get the product for $80 from John."
