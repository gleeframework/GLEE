Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to me, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $130 than $120, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
