``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price considering the product's value to him ($150) and my minimum acceptable price ($120). It gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:
