"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider my minimum selling price, and $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
