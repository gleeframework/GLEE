"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this to be a fair offer considering what it can do for your business.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This price reflects the value I know it holds while still giving you a competitive edge.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
