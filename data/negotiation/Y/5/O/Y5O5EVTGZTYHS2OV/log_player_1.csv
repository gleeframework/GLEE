Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still giving me a decent profit.  

I'll keep an eye on how Bob responds, and I'm prepared to make further counteroffers or walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm offering $12,500, which is the middle ground between my last offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're both trying to find a good deal, Alice. How about $11,500?  That's a compromise I can live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob completely, and John is always a safe option at $15,000. Therefore, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
