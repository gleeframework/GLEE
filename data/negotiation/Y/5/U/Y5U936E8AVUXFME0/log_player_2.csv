Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $500,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further,  Alice's offer of $550,000 is a good price, especially considering John would charge $800,000.  It's a good compromise that saves Bob significant money."
