"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. I'm really interested in this product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible.  While $9,250 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate lower. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer, but it's worth trying before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9,250 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That's a fair compromise and a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, which was $9250. I'll offer you $9375. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,375 is getting closer to Bob's budget, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal.  It's a good price considering John is selling the product for $10,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $625 compared to buying from John."
