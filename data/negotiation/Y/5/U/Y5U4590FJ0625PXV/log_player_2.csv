"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  It's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to our goals. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $11,000 is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You have 7 rounds remaining, and you can still potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too far from my goal.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is getting closer to your budget, but it's still a bit high.  You have 5 rounds left and you're only $900 away from your ideal price. It's worth pushing for a slightly lower price to see if you can get it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10800} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $10,850.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's wrap this up and close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,850 is just $850 above your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, you only have 3 rounds left.  Given that John is offering the same product for $10,000, it's safer to accept Alice's offer and secure the product.  It's a good compromise, and you're still saving $150 compared to John's price."
