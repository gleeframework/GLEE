"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item valued at $15,000 by you, at a price that is higher than my cost but still within your perceived value range. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within your budget. In response, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,500 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the transaction while still providing you with a reasonable saving compared to the original asking price. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $13,500, which is still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000 and is a good compromise.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that is less than John's offer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
