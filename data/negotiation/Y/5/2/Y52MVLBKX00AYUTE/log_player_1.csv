Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a very slow rate. We're getting into the later rounds of the negotiation, and it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark that guarantees we don't lose money. Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price."
