Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price?

While $10,000 is my minimum, I can likely get more from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference: $10,250.  I'm willing to make this my final offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, can you meet me at $9,900? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but $10,250 is still a bit out of my range 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly less flexible with his offers, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  At this point, it's wiser to sell to John and guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
