"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a truly valuable product. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Given its potential worth, I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but well above my minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** The language is positive and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for discussions"" signals my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask. While it's still above my minimum, I believe I have room to negotiate a better deal.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ would you consider $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving significantly closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  I'm still holding firm on the product's value while providing a reason for my counteroffer (""undervalues the product's true potential"").
* **Meeting Halfway:** This tactic can be persuasive as it suggests a fair compromise. 
* **Strong but Not Too Aggressive:** I don't want to appear inflexible, but I also want to signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price far below what I believe is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored around the $1,000,000 mark. While I could likely push for a bit more, $1,075,000 is a substantial profit margin and a good deal. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations further."
