"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, so I'll offer you $95. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell it to you for $97. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",97.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $94?",94.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer you a final compromise: I'll sell it to you for $96. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a final compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $96 and my original offer of $90, so I'll offer $93. Can you consider that?",93.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $93. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. Good luck finding a good deal elsewhere!",100.0,Alice,9,
