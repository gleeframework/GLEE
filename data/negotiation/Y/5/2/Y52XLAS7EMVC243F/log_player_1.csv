Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $85?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway.
