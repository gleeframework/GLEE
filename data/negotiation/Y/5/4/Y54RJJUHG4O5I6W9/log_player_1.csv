Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer sets a high bar, aiming to maximize profit. It also provides a message that emphasizes the value and uniqueness of the product to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the target of maximizing profit. Rejecting allows for further negotiation to try and secure a price closer to the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit low for the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $975,000? This reflects the unique nature of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $960000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While a bit lower than the target, $960,000 is still a good deal, especially considering the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or Bob backing out entirely. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential for a lower sale or selling to John for a significantly lower price."
