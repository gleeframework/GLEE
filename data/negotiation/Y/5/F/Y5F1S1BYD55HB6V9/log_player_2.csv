"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [product description] for a price that I believe is mutually beneficial. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This price allows you to make a significant profit while ensuring I receive a fair value for my investment.  Consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident you won't find a better deal. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you can get the product for a slightly lower price from Alice, the difference is relatively small and still allows you to achieve your goal of buying the product within your budget."
