Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $175 offers a reasonable markup while still being potentially attractive to Bob, considering it's worth $150 to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price."
