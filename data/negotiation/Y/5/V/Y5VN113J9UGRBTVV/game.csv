"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, how about we split the difference and go with $9250?  ",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal and move forward.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I'm starting to run out of time, so I'm going to have to be firm on this.  $8700 just isn't enough.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers and settle on $8850?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a great product.  Let's make this happen.",8850.0,Alice,7,
