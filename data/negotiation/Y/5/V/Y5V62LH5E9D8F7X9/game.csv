"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a solid margin. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This gives you a substantial gain, while still allowing me to reach my minimum goal. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers and pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you to close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
