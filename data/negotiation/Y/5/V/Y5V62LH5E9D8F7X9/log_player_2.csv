"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a solid margin. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This gives you a substantial gain, while still allowing me to reach my minimum goal. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and you should aim to get a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers and pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
