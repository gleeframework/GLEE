**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently making small incremental increases in his offers, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 guarantee with John. You've demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, but further haggling with Bob might not yield a worthwhile return compared to the guaranteed sale with John."
