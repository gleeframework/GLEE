,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $14,000. Could we perhaps aim for $12,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
