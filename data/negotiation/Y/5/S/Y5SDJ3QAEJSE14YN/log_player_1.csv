Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $14,000. Could we perhaps aim for $12,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining the product.
