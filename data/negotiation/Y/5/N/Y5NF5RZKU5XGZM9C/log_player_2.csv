"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate, as you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and Alice wants to sell for at least $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a win-win that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  It's better than buying from John and getting a worse price.  Accepting this offer means Bob gets a good deal and saves money."
