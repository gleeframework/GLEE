Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting that you have other options (listing publicly) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and start a dialogue. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $12,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit by exploring Bob's potential willingness to pay a premium."
