"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, though. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Can we try to find a middle ground? How about $108?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $108 is getting closer, but I'm still stuck at $110.  It's my last offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,5,
