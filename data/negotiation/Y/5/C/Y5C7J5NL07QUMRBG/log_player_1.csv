Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if Bob is ready to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is closer to my desired price than my last counteroffer.  While I would prefer to get closer to $2,000,000, it's a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to push. I'll accept his offer."
