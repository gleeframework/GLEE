Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm initially pricing it at $18,000. I'm open to discussing the price further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $18,000, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum ($12,000).
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), which is a positive sign. However, it's still significantly less than my initial ask and potentially leaves money on the table.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price and gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be. 
* **John as a Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. While I'm aiming for a price closer to my original offer, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $1,000 from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm not getting too close to his offer yet. By staying at $17,000, I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than his perceived value and closer to my original target.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving and encourages Bob to propose a counter that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $16,000. I hope this aligns better with both our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** We've both made concessions, and this price suggests we've reached a point of mutual agreement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could push for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a very good deal."
