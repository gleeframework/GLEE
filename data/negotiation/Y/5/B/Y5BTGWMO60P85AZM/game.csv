,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm confident you'll still find this a good value considering the product's worth.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference at $9,125? I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll receive.",9125.0,Alice,5,
