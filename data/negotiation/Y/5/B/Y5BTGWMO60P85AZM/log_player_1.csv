"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm confident you'll still find this a good value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to do $8,750?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference at $9,125? I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 9125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has been a helpful negotiation. I can tell we are getting close.  How about $8,900?  I think that's a fair offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer once more and see if we can finally reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant discount for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
