"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is truly unique and goes beyond typical market comparisons. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $2,100,000? This allows both of us to find some common ground.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
