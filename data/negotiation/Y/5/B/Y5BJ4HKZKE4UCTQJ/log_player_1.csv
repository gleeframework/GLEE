This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate downwards if needed. The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the conversation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be comfortable paying $12000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it is still below my minimum value. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now above my minimum value of $10,000. It is also closer to my desired price than John's offer. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer."
