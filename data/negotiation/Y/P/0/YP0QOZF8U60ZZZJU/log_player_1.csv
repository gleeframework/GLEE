"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $1,000 difference leaves space for negotiation and potential for a win-win scenario. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the tone friendly and encouraging helps build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I still have 9 rounds to reach a more agreeable price.  
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer.  
* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference, $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  It's been a few rounds, and further negotiation may be time-consuming.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower offer or a longer negotiation, costing me time and potentially leading to a deal with John."
