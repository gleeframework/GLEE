"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price of $1,200,000 as possible. What are your thoughts?
