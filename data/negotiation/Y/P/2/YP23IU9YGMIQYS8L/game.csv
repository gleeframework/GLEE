"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still provides a good return for me while being closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,350,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
