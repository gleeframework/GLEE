{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is advantageous to me while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers, and I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a good amount, it's too far below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to John's offer that it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation.  This deal secures a good price for me while also finalizing the sale quickly."
