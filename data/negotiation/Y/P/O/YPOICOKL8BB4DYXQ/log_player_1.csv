Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase [product name] for $1,000,000. This is a unique product with significant value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Gauging interest:**  A high initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, you can adjust accordingly.
* **Justification:** While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you can highlight the unique aspects of the product and its potential for future returns to justify the price. 

**Important:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but securing the sale is also crucial."
