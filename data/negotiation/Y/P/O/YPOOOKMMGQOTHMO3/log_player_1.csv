Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It also signals my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
