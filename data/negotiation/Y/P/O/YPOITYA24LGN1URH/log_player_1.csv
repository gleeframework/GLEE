Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I still believe I can negotiate a higher price. There are 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $887,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go down to $880,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still a little lower than my ideal, I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a significant risk that if I keep rejecting, I might end up with nothing. Accepting Bob's offer at $880,000 is a secure choice, as it's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000."
