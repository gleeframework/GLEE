"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is considerably higher than that.  I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to find a middle ground here. While $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to accept $16,000. This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $14,000, which is a fair price given the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a meeting point.",14000.0,Bob,6,
