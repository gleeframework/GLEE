You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is exactly $15,000, there's no reason to reject the offer or buy from John. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice as it gets you the product at your maximum price point."
