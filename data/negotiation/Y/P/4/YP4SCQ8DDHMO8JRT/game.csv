"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product has higher potential, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
