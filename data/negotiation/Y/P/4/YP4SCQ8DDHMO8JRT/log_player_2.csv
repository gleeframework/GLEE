# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing further.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
