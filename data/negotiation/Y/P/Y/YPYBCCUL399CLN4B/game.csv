"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider a price of $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
