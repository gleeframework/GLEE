"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though you want to save as much as possible, Alice's offer of $90 is still cheaper than John's offer of $100. 
* **You still get a good deal:** You value the product at $100, and Alice is selling it to you for $90, so you're still getting a $10 discount."
