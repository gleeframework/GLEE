Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,350,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  We have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,275,000 is getting closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I have four rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still need to be closer to my desired price. Let's split the difference and go with $1,287,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last two rounds, and I've been unable to reach an agreement with Bob above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me a secure profit."
