"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire this unique item, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Target in Mind:** My goal is to buy the product for under $800,000. Starting at $700,000 gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying within my budget.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and expresses continued interest, which helps maintain a positive negotiating environment."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is still higher than John's price of $800,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, having moved from $950,000 to $850,000. There's a good chance she might go lower.

I'll aim to get closer to my target price in the next round."

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** I'm moving up in smaller increments now ($700,000 to $750,000) to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how much further Alice is willing to go. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm keeping John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a fallback option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000.
* **John's price is better:**  John's offer of $800,000 is still the most financially advantageous option.
* **Limited potential savings:** At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her sticking to her price or the deal falling through entirely, leaving me with no savings.

While it's possible I could squeeze a few thousand more out of Alice, it's not worth risking the guaranteed savings of $25,000 by going with John."
