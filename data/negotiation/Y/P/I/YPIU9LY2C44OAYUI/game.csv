"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",10500.0,Alice,5,
