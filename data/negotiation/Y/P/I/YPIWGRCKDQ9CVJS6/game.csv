,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $10,200.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm still not willing to sell at $9,900, but I'm willing to meet you at $10,400. This is my final offer.",10400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said $10,400 was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still make a deal.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,400 and $10,000, so I'm offering it to you for $10,200.",10200.0,Alice,9,
