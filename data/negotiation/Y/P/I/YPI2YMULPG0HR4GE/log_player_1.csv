Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what I could get from John. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $140. This is a compromise that demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a price closer to my desired value. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $150. I'm also hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $135.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise but also that I value the product.  It also leaves room for a potential final agreement, as $135 is halfway between our last two offers. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to accept John's offer and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures that I get at least my minimum desired value for the product."
