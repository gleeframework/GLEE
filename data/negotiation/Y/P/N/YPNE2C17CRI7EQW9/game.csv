"Hey Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a little out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",87.5,Bob,4,
