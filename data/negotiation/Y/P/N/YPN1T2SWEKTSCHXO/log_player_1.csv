Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This avoids confusion and sets a clear expectation for the negotiation. 
* **It's friendly and inviting:** This helps build a positive rapport with Bob and encourages him to engage in the negotiation.

If Bob rejects the offer, you can then analyze his counteroffer and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($120). While it's tempting to accept his offer considering his rejection, it's crucial to hold your ground and maintain your profit margin. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your position:** It signals to Bob that you are serious about your price and not willing to drastically compromise.
* **Negotiate a better deal:** You can use this opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to your preferred price.
* **Test Bob's seriousness:** By rejecting his first counteroffer, you can see if he is genuinely interested in negotiating or simply looking for a bargain.

In the next round, you can offer a counteroffer closer to your minimum price but still lower than your initial offer, perhaps $105. This approach demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
