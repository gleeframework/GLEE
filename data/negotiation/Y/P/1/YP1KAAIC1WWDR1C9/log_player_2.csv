"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, saving himself $50,000."
