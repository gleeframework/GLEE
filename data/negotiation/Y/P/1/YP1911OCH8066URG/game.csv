"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is great, but I can't justify paying $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a very close offer to your last one, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $910,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $910,000, so I'll offer it to you for $912,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,7,
