"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and there are more rounds to negotiate.  Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a profitable transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  This counteroffer starts a negotiation process and presents a lower price that is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price.  It leaves room for further negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at a price of $875000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price.  While there's potential for a lower price, the risk of further negotiation failing and being forced to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price."
