{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** I need to sell the product for at least $150 to break even (since I have another buyer lined up).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it to Bob slightly below my minimum allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit than $150. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price that might be appealing to Bob (as it's higher than his perceived value of $100) while still giving me a good profit margin if he accepts. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I can always negotiate or move closer to my minimum acceptable price."
