"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can get the product for a lower price from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
