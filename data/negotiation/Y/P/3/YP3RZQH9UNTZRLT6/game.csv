"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $130 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That gives us both a good deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we go for $128? I really think that's a fair price for the product.,128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $128 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $132.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal!",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. How about we meet in the middle at $129? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,129.0,Bob,6,
