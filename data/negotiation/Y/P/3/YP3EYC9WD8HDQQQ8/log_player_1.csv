Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept.  Here's why:

* **It's more than my minimum:** $120 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $120 is still a good deal for Bob since he values the product at $150. 
* **It's a good compromise:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $80, so there's little risk in offering this price."
