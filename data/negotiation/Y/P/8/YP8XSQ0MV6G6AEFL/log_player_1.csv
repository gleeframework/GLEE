Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my $800,000 limit. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which reflects its value while keeping it within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
