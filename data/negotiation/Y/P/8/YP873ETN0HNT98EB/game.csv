"I appreciate the offer, but $180 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  If you're interested in making a deal, let me know. ",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",130.0,Alice,5,
