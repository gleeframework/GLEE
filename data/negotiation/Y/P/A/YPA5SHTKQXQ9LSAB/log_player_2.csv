"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profitable price for her. By starting low, we can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to her bottom line, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer shows Alice we are willing to move, but also sets a firm target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you want. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has now met her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal. Accepting at $8,000 secures you a good price and avoids the risk of having to pay John's higher price."
