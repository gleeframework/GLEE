"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
