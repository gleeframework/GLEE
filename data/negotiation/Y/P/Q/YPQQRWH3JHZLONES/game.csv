"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to own a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to discuss this further, but my initial counteroffer is $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value is still a bit higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too far off for me. Let's keep moving towards a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's reach an agreement before we run out of time.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your latest offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's make this happen before time runs out. ",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,075,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to offer, considering the product's value to me. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a personalized setup service, worth $20,000, if you're willing to meet me at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
