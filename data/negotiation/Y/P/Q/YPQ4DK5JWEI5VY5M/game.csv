"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. It's a steal at $18,000, and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I want to find a solution that works for us both. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  This feels fair considering the value this product will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While it seems like a good deal, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
