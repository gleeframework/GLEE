"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
