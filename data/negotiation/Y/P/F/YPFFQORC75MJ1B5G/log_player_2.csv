"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still too high for him, considering his maximum budget is $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $7,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. This is still a great deal, considering the market value of the product is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $8,500 is closer to his desired range, he can still try to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  At $8,750, Bob is saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. 
* **There's a risk of losing the deal.**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and he could end up paying more or even losing the opportunity to buy the product.
* **Time is running out.** Bob has fewer rounds left to negotiate.  

While $8,750 is not the ideal price, accepting the offer in this round is the most strategic choice to maximize savings and secure the product before potentially losing it."
