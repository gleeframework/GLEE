"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you have a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but that's your maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price point, but you're still aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you another opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me and allows us both to make a deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,250. It's a fair price that reflects the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is within your budget and is only $250 more than your last counteroffer.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product without further negotiation and saves you $3,750 compared to buying from John.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential benefit of saving another $250."
