"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility, but I think $98 is the lowest I can go. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",98.0,Alice,5,
