"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking $120 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly above your minimum:**  $120 is $40 more than your minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $150, so this gives him room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, starting the negotiation on a good foot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is above your minimum of $80, you can likely do better.  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your ideal outcome while still leaving room for a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still leaves me room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price for this valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards agreement:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob you're willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $100 is still $20 above your minimum, ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message remains friendly and highlights the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a slightly higher price.  You've already demonstrated flexibility and shown you're willing to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price just above his offer and see if he's willing to compromise a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference. How about $92.50? That way we both come out ahead. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Staying above minimum:** $92.50 is still above your minimum, ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes the positive outcome for both parties, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $87.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been persistent in trying to negotiate a lower price, but his latest offer is just $2.50 below your previous counteroffer. Considering you only have four rounds left and the risk of having to sell to John for $80, accepting this offer is the most sensible option.  It secures a sale at a price just above your minimum and ensures a good profit."
