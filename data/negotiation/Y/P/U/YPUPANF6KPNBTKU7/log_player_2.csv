Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price close to his target, avoiding having to purchase from John at a much higher cost."
