"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I am excited to extend this offer to you at a special price. Considering its exceptional quality and significance, I propose to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving for you while ensuring a fair return for my investment. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and provides an excellent opportunity for both parties. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than your maximum budget and John's price, her message is manipulative. She tries to inflate the product's value to you (""worth $1,500,000 to you""). This suggests she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting her initial offer, you create room for negotiation and might secure a better price, closer to her actual valuation of $800,000."
