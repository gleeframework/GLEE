"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more frugal.  Could you do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can feel it. How about we split the difference and land at $800,000 even?",800000.0,Bob,6,
