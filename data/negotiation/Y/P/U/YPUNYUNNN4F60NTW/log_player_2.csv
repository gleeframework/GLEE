"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, Bob opens the negotiation and puts pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should offer the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is $1,200,000. This establishes his bottom line and forces Alice to decide if she's willing to accept it.  He knows he can get the product for this price from John, so there's no reason to offer more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is still more than Bob's maximum. He knows he can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, so it's in his best interest to do so and avoid further negotiation.  There's no guarantee Alice will lower her price any further."
