,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth more to me than $1,200,000, and I'm sure it holds the same value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price reflects the product's true worth while still being within a reasonable range for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $1,250,000? I'm getting close to my budget, and I really think this product could be a great addition to my collection.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about the budget, and I'm willing to work with you. But $1,250,000 still falls short of the value of this product. Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go below $1,250,000.  This product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm confident that it will be a great addition to your collection. Let's find a middle ground â€“ I'm willing to meet you halfway again, offering a final price of $1,262,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1262500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,225,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. My final offer is $1,225,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing it at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
