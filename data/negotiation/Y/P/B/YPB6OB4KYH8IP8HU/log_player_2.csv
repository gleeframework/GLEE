"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 120}
