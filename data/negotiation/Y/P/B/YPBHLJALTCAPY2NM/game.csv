"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $16750. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",16750.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $16750, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I think this is a fair price. If you're still not willing to meet me at $16750, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16750, but I need a decision soon.",16750.0,Alice,9,
