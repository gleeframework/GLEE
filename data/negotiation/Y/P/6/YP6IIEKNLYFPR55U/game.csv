"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe we could come to an agreement that would be beneficial for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $105 is still a bit out of my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
