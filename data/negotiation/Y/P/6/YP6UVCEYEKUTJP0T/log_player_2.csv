"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it could significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to profit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
