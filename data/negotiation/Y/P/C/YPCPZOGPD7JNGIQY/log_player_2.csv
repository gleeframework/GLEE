"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $15,000, and I know you're looking for something just like it. I'm willing to let it go for $16,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
