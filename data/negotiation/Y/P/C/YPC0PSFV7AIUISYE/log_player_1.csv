Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a ways off from what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant step for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating and try to push him a bit higher, it's getting risky. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the potential of Bob walking away in later rounds."
