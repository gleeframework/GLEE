"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm looking for a price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a ways off from what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to bridge the gap.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $16,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant step for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",14000.0,Bob,6,
