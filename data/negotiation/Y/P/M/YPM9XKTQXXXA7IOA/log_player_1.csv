Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies high demand (""interest I've already received"") to justify the high price, even though John is your backup.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet closer to your desired price.

**Important Note:** While you aim high, be prepared to potentially negotiate down if Bob shows resistance. Your absolute floor should be $15,000 to ensure you don't lose money compared to selling to John."
