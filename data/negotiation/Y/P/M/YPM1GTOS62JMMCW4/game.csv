"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go lower than $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's a significant discount from my original offer and a good opportunity for you to secure this valuable product. Let's make this deal happen.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about buying from John for $1,000,000. Can you really go any lower?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
