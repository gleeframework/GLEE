Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,250,000 is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum and still profitable for me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and leaves room for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum gives me confidence to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but no more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Better Outcome Possible:** I believe there's room to push for a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Compromise:**  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the benefits of the deal for both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm still leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Plan B in Mind:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Although Bob is offering closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to meet my needs.
* **Higher outcome possible:** There's a good chance that by continuing to negotiate, I can get a higher price. 
* **Plan B is a safety net:** I'm confident that selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go lower than $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's a significant discount from my original offer and a good opportunity for you to secure this valuable product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""good opportunity"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Closing Statement:**  I'm  emphasizing the need to finalize the deal. 
* **Plan B Backup:**  I'm still aware that I can sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about buying from John for $1,000,000. Can you really go any lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Bluff:** Bob is clearly bluffing about buying from John for $1,000,000.  He knows John is willing to pay more. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
* **Better Deal Available:** John is offering a significantly higher price, ensuring a much better outcome for me.
* **No Further Negotiation:** It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly. 

Selling to John is the most financially advantageous decision at this point."
