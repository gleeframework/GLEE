"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
