Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly from her price. At this point, the negotiations are unlikely to result in a price significantly better than John's offer. Accepting John's offer of $1,200,000 saves time and avoids the risk of the price going up further in future rounds."
