"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. It holds a value of $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will bring significant returns. My asking price is $1,250,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's worth and allows you to secure it at a price lower than its value to you. Please consider this offer carefully, as it represents a rare chance to acquire a highly sought-after asset.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
