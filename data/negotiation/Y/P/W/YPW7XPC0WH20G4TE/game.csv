"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do see the value in the product,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's try to close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
