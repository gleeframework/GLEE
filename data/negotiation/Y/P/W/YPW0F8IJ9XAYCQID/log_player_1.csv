"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and would be a worthwhile investment.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but well above my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I signal that I value the product and believe in its worth. However, the message also clearly indicates my openness to negotiation.
* **Alternative Option in Mind:** It's important to remember that I have John as a backup buyer. This gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price of $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  It's early in the negotiation, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but hold firm):** I'm signaling willingness to compromise by significantly reducing my initial asking price. However, I'm still holding firm above my minimum and aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob. 
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** By suggesting a specific price, I'm encouraging Bob to counter with a number closer to my range. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Time Consideration:** While we have several rounds left, it's good to make progress in each round. This ensures we have ample time to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to come down a bit more. Would you be open to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Stronger Position:** While I could potentially push for a bit more, Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to my range. It's a good sign that we're reaching a point of agreement.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a profitable outcome."
