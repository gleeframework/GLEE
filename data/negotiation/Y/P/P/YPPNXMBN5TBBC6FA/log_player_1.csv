Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, getting Alice closer to her ideal selling price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $12,000 might be perceived as trying to take Bob's entire perceived value, making him less likely to accept.  
* **Secure a Sale:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's offer ($10,000), making it more likely Bob will accept to avoid missing out."
