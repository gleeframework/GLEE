"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering your desire to sell and my desire to purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
