Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **Bob's Perspective:** While the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, he doesn't know your minimum price or John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The slightly lower price than $15,000 might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential profit before resorting to the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
