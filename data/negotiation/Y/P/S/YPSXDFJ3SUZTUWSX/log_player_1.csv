Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive by stating this is my ""final"" price. I'm leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've achieved a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counter-offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or move on to John if the price isn't satisfactory."
