"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $650000. I'm confident we can work out a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $680000. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $725000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
