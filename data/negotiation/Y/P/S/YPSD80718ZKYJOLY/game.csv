"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $700,000.  This product is incredibly valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
