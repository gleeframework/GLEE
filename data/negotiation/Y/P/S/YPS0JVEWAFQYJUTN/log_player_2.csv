"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.**  This is more than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).
* **John's offer is $1,500,000.** This is also more than what the product is worth to you, but it's the best you can get if you reject Alice's offer. 

**Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price with John, or find another seller altogether.**"
