"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me. It also leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  While I'd like to make a deal,  $60 is a significant loss for me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $100.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still ensures I make a profit.  I believe this price is reasonable and may be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This is a further concession, but I'm still confident I can make a decent profit. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is getting closer, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.  I have a few more rounds to go, and I'm not ready to settle for anything less than $90 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $85.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair offer and finally accept. If he doesn't, I'm running out of time and might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and while $80 is a reasonable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I've made several concessions, and there's a risk that Bob might continue to lowball me. To avoid the possibility of a disappointing outcome, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $120.  While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it ensures I make a profit and avoids further risk."
