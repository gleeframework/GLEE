{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $135 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than your minimum value, leaving some room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $125?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can still try to get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. $125 is closer to what I had in mind. I'm willing to go down to $130. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
