,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $110 to make this deal work. Let's find a solution we're both happy with!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too low on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Can we make it work at that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $108. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",107.0,Bob,6,
