"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,800 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's try $8,000.  That's my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of this product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
