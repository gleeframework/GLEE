"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $7,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $7,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Strategic Goal:** Our ideal outcome is to get the price somewhere between Alice's value ($8,000) and our maximum ($10,000). This counteroffer starts the negotiation process towards that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  This is still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice came down from $9,500 to $8,500, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** $8,500 is still closer to Alice's desired price than ours. There's room to meet closer to the middle. 
* **Limited Risk:** We have plenty of rounds left, and John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we agree on $7,500? That would work well for me."",
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving up in smaller increments now, showing Alice we're serious but also being mindful of our budget.
* **Middle Ground:** $7,500 is a reasonable compromise, halfway between our previous offer and her current one.
* **Positive Tone:** We want to keep the negotiation collaborative and avoid a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $7,500 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Alice's Value:** Alice has come down to her product's value of $8,000. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Good Deal:**  This price is well below our maximum of $10,000 and a significant saving compared to John's offer.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids potential further back-and-forth and guarantees we secure the product."
