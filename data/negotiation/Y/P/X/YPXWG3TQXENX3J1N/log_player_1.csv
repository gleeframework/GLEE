Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we agree on $7,500? That would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $7,500 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
