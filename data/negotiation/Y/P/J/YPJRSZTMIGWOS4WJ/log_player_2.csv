Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to invest. However, $850,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm going to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go below $900,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's risky. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000, saving yourself $100,000 and avoiding potential further stalemate."
