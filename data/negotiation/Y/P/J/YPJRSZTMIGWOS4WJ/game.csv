"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $825,000? I think that's a fair price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on your price, but I have to stick to my budget.  How about $850,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to invest. However, $850,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm going to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,7,
