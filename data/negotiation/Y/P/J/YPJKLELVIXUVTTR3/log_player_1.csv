"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 
Let's start high to give ourselves room to negotiate.  We want to create the impression that the product is worth significantly more than Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than our minimum. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and the option to sell to John secures our minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than that, especially considering its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe it's a competitive offer."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

We're coming down, but still aiming high. We want to signal that we're willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could push for a bit more, $14,000 is a solid offer exceeding Bob's perceived value and giving us a good profit. It's better to secure the deal now than risk Bob lowering his offer or walking away in later rounds."
