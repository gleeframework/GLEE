"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and expressing confidence in the product's appeal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum value. I'm also reiterating my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to keep working with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That seems fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm offering a price in the middle of our last two offers, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  I'm also trying to build momentum and express confidence in reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $92.50 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $91.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still slightly below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum value.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next rounds, and it's getting late in the negotiation.  It's better to secure a sale at a decent price than risk losing the deal entirely."
