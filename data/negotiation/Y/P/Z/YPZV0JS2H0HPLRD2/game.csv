"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $9,000? This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
