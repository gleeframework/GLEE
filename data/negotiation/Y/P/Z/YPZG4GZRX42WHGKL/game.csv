"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this valuable asset.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to $7,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,200. It's a great price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you, and I think it's a fair deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
