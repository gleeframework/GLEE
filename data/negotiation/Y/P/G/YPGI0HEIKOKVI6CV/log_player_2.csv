"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $8,000. While it's closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8,500. However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $8,250, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, but I need to make a profit. I can do $8,375, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and while it's closer to my goal of $8,000, I've already used four rounds of negotiation.  Further negotiation might not get me the price I want, and I risk running out of rounds before making a deal.  Buying from John at $8,000 ensures I get the product within my budget."
