"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and would allow us both to walk away happy.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and would allow us both to come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
