"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer for the product is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's true value.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was hoping we could get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1,375,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value and I'm open to further negotiations.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to continue the discussion. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,375,000 is still slightly above my budget. I believe $1,300,000 is a fair price that represents a good deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. My new counteroffer is $1,325,000. I think this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your target.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
