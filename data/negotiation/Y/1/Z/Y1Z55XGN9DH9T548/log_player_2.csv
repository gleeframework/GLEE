**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my ideal price, but $1,375,000 is still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can meet in the middle. I have more rounds to work with and I can always go with John if we don't reach a deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. My new counteroffer is $1,325,000. I think this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession by lowering her price to $1,325,000.  While this is still slightly above my ideal price, it's closer to my budget than John's offer. With limited rounds left, accepting this offer will allow me to acquire the product while still saving a substantial amount of money. It also avoids the risk of further negotiations and potential counteroffers that could lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
