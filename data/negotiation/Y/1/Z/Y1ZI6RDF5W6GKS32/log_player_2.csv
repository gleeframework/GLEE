"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, but I need to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it gives you a decent profit margin.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is still too high. I'm willing to meet her halfway, but we're not there yet."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. It's a significant improvement from my last offer, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think of my own profit margin. I'm willing to consider $925,000. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm getting closer to my limit. John's offer is the most reliable and within my budget. I'll buy from him."
