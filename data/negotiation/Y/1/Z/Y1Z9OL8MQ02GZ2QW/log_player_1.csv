"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).  This gives me some room to negotiate and also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price. 

Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he's likely to counteroffer. This will allow me to gauge his level of interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe I can get closer to my target of $15,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price point.  

It's important to remember that Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so a price of $14,500 is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I want to see if I can get even closer to $14,500.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John at this point, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my price to $14,000. This is another compromise to show Bob I'm willing to be flexible.  However, this is still a good deal for me, as it's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  

We are now halfway through the rounds, and it's important to balance pushing for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still not satisfied with $13,800.  Even though we are getting closer, it's still not close enough to my desired price point.  I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my target of $14,000.  

With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the possibility of having to sell to John at a lower price.  However, I'm still determined to get the best possible deal for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13900}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 3 rounds left, I'm going to be a bit more aggressive. I'm offering $13,900, which is closer to Bob's offer. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal and that I'm willing to meet him halfway. I believe this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, and may be enough to convince him to accept.  

I'm taking a calculated risk here, but I think it's worth it to see if we can reach an agreement."
