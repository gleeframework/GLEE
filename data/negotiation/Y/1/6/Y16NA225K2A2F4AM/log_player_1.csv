Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you're in a strong position.  Starting with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Profit:** There's a chance Bob might value the product more than he thinks or is willing to pay a premium for a quick and easy purchase. 
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything. You can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
