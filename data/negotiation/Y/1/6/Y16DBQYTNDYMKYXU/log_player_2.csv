"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1450000.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1200000 to you.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price. Let me know your decision, and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you. You can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better price."
