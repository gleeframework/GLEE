"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,500? It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me some wiggle room.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750.  How about we settle at $11,250? It's closer to your last offer and still gives me a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!",11250.0,Alice,5,
