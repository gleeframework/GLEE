Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Range:** There's a potential $200,000 surplus that you and Bob could split.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value and might make him walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to capitalize on its potential."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 allows Bob to still gain $50,000 in value while you secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it as ""a fair reflection of its worth.""

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to allow room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a more generous offer might be strategic.
