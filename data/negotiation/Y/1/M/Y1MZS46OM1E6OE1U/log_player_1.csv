"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at that price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $110 is too low for me. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more than my minimum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try and counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
