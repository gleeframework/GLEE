**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to pressure me with his ""final offer"" tactic. While I've been negotiating, I have a solid offer from John for $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's final offer would mean losing $65,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob. Selling to John guarantees the best outcome for me."
