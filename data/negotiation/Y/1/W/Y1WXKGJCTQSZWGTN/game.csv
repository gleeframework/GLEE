"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I think we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $880000 for the product?",880000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $880000 is still quite a bit below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $920000.  This reflects a substantial discount for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'll consider it, but I would like to propose $890000 as a compromise. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within my budget.",890000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $905000. This is a very fair price considering both of our needs. Let's close this deal.",905000.0,Alice,5,
