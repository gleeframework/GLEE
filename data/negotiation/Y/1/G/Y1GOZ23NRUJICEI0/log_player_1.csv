{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open. I'm prepared to adjust the price depending on Bob's response, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell the product for a loss. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a price that is closer to my desired value. I will likely counter with a price closer to $150, but I'll be mindful of Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand $175 was a bit high.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price for this great product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's concerns:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns by saying I understand $175 was too high.
* **Offer a compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to reinforce the fairness of the price.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm lower limit for the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue to negotiate, the potential for further concessions to reach a profitable price for me is diminishing.

Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable value, and it's a faster and more certain outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
