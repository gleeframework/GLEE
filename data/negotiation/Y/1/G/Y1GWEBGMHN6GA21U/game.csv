"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really benefit from it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. While I see its value, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $10500.  This would still be a profitable sale for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit higher than where I can go right now. I understand this product is valuable, but I'm firm on my offer of $10500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11200. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I truly believe this deal is beneficial for everyone involved. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm offering the product to you for $10750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,7,
