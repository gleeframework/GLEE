"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $7,000. While it's tempting to accept, I'm holding out for a better price. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered me my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's time to accept his offer and close the deal. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
