"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is impressive, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $725,000? I think that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still interested.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $787,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",787500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $787,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
