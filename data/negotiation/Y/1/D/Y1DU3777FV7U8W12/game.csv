,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so I'll offer $825,000. That's the best I can do.",825000.0,Bob,4,
