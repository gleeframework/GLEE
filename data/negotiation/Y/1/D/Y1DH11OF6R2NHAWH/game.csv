"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $108 just doesn't work for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $109.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to go down to $107? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm getting closer to selling to someone else.  $107 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's settle at $108. It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to cover my costs.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to selling to someone else, but I'm really interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so I'll go down to $107.50. Can you meet me there?",107.5,Bob,8,
