"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $9,500. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $10,000.
* Alice's offer is $9,500, which is a good price, but you can do better.
* Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially get a lower price from John, or negotiate further with Alice."
