"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $100 to Alice, and $150 to you. This means there is room for negotiation.
* **Alice's Offer:** $125 is too high, especially considering you have a backup option at $150. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $110 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for a potential compromise.
* **Communication:** The message is friendly and polite, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** By offering a lower price, you are signaling your willingness to negotiate while maintaining your goal of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be really happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $115 is a good price, considering it's below your maximum price of $150 and closer to your counteroffer of $110.
* **Value:** You are likely to get a good deal at $115, and it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Strategy:** Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiations that might lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the deal."
