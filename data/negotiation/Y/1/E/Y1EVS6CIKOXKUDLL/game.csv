"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stick to my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I can't go lower than $10,750. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",9500.0,Bob,6,
