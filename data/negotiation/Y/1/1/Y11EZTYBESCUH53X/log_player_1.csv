Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible, while still ensuring a good profit margin.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's worth to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept a higher price. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80."
