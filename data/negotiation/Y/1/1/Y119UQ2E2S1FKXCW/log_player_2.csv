"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for your business.  This product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount and allows you to acquire it for a price well below its true market value.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
