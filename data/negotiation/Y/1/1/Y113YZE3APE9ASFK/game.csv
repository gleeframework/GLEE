"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Is that something you'd consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be completely frank, I have another interested buyer who sees its full potential.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty about the other interested buyer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
