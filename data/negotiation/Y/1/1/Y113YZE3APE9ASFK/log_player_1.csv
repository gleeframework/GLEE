Explanation: 

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $1,050,000 offer.  While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, accepting his offer risks:

* **Losing both buyers:** Pushing Bob further might make him walk away entirely.
* **Time wasted:** Further negotiation rounds might not yield a significantly better outcome. 

Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000, avoids further negotiation hassle, and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
