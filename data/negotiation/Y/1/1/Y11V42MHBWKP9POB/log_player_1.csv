Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights and I wouldn't want you to miss out. I'm asking for $1,750,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Value-based language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob (""significant value,"" ""your insights""), subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims for the highest possible profit. However, a very high starting price might cause Bob to immediately reject the offer without counter-offering. There's always a risk-reward balance to consider in negotiations."
