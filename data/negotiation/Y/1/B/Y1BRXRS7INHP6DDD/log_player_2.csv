# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

While Alice has come down a bit, the offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Since you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's still room for negotiation. It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can get the price lower than $1,325,000."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $1,300,000, which is only $100,000 more than your last counteroffer. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a much lower price through further negotiation.  Accepting this offer will save you $200,000 compared to buying from John."
