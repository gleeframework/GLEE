Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $130. It's a fantastic opportunity to get something you'll love at a price below what it's worth."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting at $130 aims to capture the maximum amount of Bob's perceived value ($150) without going too high. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate a bit further. 
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling for anything above $80 ensures you make a profit compared to your backup option (John)."
