Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so I can walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is still room for negotiation. I can try to meet Bob somewhere in the middle, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low price right now.
* **John as a Backup:**  It's important to remember that John is still an option if I can't get a better price from Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? This would still be a good price for you and allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.  $11,000 is a good compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to continue.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" and ""fair profit"" aspects to make my counteroffer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still a significant difference.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the effort, especially considering that I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower offer. 

Given the circumstances, it's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid the potential of a lower price or a longer negotiation process."
