{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$500,000 is a very good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  It's worth seeing if we can get an even better deal by counter-offering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 30% discount from Alice's initial price.  This is aggressive but shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.  We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}
```

Alice has shown some flexibility.  I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly, but still aim for a price that is significantly lower than her current offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved further away from my counteroffer,  $425,000 is still a very good price considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal. It's time to secure the product at a reasonable price."
