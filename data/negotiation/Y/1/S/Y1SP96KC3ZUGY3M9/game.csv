"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1300000.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1300000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1700000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while still respecting your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000, which I believe is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
