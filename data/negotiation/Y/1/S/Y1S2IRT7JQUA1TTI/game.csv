"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $2,000,000 is still too high for my budget. I can do $1,000,000.  I need to see some movement towards a more realistic price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some frustration, but I assure you I'm negotiating in good faith.  $1,000,000 is too significant a gap from where I value this. To move things along, let's try $1,750,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but that price is still not feasible for me.  To be frank, I'm working with a maximum budget of $1,200,000. If we can make a deal around there, I'm ready to close. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
