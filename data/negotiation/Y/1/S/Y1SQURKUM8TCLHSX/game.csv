"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but $9800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'm also keeping the option to sell it to John for $10000, so I'm going to make a slightly higher counteroffer of $10700. This is my final offer for now.",10700.0,Alice,5,
