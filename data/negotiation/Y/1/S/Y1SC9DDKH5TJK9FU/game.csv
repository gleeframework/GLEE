"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm really hoping to get this product, so let's see if we can make it work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still hoping to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but my budget is limited. How about we settle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm going to offer you the product for $92.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,
