"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm thinking $1,050,000. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $1,050,000 is still unfortunately below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $1,025,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
