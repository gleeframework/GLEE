Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.
