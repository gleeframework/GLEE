"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to meet you halfway. This price still allows me a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit higher than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $9,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,
