Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done my research and I'm not sure the product is worth more than that to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with accepting it. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better price closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This represents a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, which would be $8,875. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,875 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  I have a backup offer from John, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,875 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,125.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident that we can find common ground at this price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise, but $9,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I am getting closer to my goal with Bob's offer, it is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to secure a better price. I've already had multiple offers and counteroffers from Bob and am getting closer to my ideal price, but it's not enough to make it worthwhile. It's time to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
