Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the fact that I have another offer for $1,000,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,250,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value to me and my alternative offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that makes sense for me. At this point, the difference in our valuations is significant, and it's better to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
