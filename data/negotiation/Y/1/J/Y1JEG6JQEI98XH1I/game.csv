"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,162,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,162,500 is closer to your budget, I can't let it go for less than $1,190,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
