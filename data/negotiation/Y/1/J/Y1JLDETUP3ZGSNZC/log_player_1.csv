"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will either entice Bob to accept or give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product through his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is a respectable offer, it's still below my ideal target. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and counter with my own to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not yet ready to settle. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, and I'm not willing to lose out on potential profit. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,600,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's becoming clear that Bob is firm on his price point. This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to settle. With only 4 rounds left, I'm hoping to push for a bit more. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to accept a price that feels too low. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

We're getting close to the end of negotiations, and I need to find a balance between getting a good price and securing a deal. I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to accept. If not, I'll have to weigh the potential of getting a higher price in the remaining rounds against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price. However, with only two rounds left, I don't think there's time to push for a higher price.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
