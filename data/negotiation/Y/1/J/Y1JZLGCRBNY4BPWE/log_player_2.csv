"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's desired price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let's start with $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is too far below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a good compromise and give you a great deal on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better deal than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet at $900,000? It's closer to my budget and would still be a profitable deal for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. This is a good compromise, and it's a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $925,000 is getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his target. There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $925,000. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $912,500 is still below my target. How about we settle on $920,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and negotiation rounds.  While Alice's offer of $920,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is too high. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
