"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by me. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay. However, I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in discussing a price that suits both of us? If not, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to establish a high perceived value for the product. 
* While she mentions John is willing to pay $150, this could be a negotiation tactic.
* You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so there's no need to settle for $140. 

By rejecting the offer, you can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further down or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
