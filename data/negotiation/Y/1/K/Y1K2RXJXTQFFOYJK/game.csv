"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000?  I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1400000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider a price of $1300000? This would be a good starting point for a final agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $1400000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
