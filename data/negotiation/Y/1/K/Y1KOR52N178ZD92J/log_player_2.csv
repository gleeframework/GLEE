"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her true value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get the price down even further.  He has more rounds available and can always choose to buy from John if he's not satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is a significant step closer to my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:**  He could try to negotiate further with Alice, but there's no guarantee that she will lower her price, and he's already in round 5, leaving only 5 rounds left.

2. **Buy from John:**  This is the most logical decision. John is offering the product for $10,000, which is within Bob's budget. There is no need to risk further negotiation with Alice when John is offering a guaranteed deal."
