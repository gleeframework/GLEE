"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $95, which is still more than you are willing to pay from John for $100. 
* Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
