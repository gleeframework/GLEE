Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Stay Above Your Minimum:**  It's important to stay above your $150 minimum to ensure you're making a profit.

By offering the product at $140, you strike a balance between trying to maximize profit with Bob while also ensuring a profitable sale regardless."
