"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I can offer it to you for $100. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $80, and I'm already giving you a discount.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $85? ",85.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer it to you for $95. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",95.0,Alice,5,
