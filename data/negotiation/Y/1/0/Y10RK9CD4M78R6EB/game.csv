"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $160. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a good compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",180.0,Alice,5,

"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to accept this price, I'll take the product.",150.0,Bob,6,
