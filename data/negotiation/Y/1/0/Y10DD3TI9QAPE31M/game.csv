"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $12,000. How about we split the difference at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but $16,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $15,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $16,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, which will bring the total value of the deal to $17,500. What do you think about this revised offer?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added value, but  $16,500 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference on the price and call it a day.  I'll take the product for $16,000,  that way we both get a deal we can feel good about.",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'll meet you in the middle again, but this time at $16,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product and the extras I'm including. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,7,
