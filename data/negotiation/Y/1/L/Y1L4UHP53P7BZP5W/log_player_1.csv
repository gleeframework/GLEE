"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so starting significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and even my minimum ($1,500,000) provides room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and allows him to counter. 
* **John as Leverage:**  The knowledge that we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't mention John directly, as it's generally better to keep alternative options private in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate and John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the full potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  We're showing flexibility by coming down from the initial offer, but still aiming high.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning the ""full potential"" reinforces the idea that the product might be worth more than Bob currently thinks.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're moving closer to our minimum but leaving space for further negotiation if needed.  We're getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes a serious alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
