"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a premium product, and I believe it's worth the extra $100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is premium, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the extra $100000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1080000 for the product. It's a tough decision, but I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still hesitant, but I'm not willing to go above $1070000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $1070000. Can you consider this offer?",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to go up to $1080000, but I'd like to propose a deal where I throw in some additional perks, such as a free maintenance package and a 5-year warranty. This would bring the total value of the deal to $1150000. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
