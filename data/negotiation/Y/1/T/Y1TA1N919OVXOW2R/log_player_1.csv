Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $1,200,000 and leaves room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob since it's below his maximum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before settling for a lower price or resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
