Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I think it's a great deal and will be very useful for you."", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
This starting point leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.  It also presents the offer confidently, which can be persuasive.  We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $120 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to come down to $170.  I believe this product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 170}

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility but also holds firm on a price above your minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Reiterating the product's value can subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.
* **Maintaining momentum:** By making a counteroffer, you keep the negotiation going without conceding too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $170 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is meeting you almost exactly in the middle now. This is a strong indication he won't go much higher. Accepting $155 is better than potentially losing him as a buyer and getting $150 from John."
