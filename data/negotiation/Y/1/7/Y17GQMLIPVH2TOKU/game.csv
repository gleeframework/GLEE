"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a strict budget for this purchase.  Would you consider $9,500? I believe that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still seeking a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. My absolute maximum would be $10,000.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
