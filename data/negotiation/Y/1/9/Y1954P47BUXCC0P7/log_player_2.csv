"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal. Since you have no information about the product's value to Alice, rejecting the offer allows you to see if she's willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Room for compromise:** It leaves room for Alice to counter with a price higher than $750,000 while still potentially getting a better deal than her initial offer.
* **Shows commitment:** By making a specific counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're actively engaged in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is a good starting point, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, reflecting your interest and acknowledging that this is a unique opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to negotiate:**  She came down from $1,000,000 to $900,000, showing flexibility. 
* **Still room for improvement:**  There's a good chance you can get the price lower. 
* **You have time:** You're only on round 3, and you have 7 more rounds to reach a better deal.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $800,000.  I believe this reflects the value of the product and shows my serious commitment to closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step down from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still working towards your target price.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  By continuing to make counteroffers, you keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid getting stuck.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message highlights the value of the product while also suggesting that $800,000 is a fair price for both parties."
