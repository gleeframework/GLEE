"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us! This is the best price I can offer, but if you decline, I have another buyer lined up at that price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John, rejecting the offer maintains the possibility of finding a better deal later.  There is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as rejecting it provides the same outcome."
