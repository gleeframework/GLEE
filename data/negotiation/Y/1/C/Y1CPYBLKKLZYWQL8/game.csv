"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $110. This is a fair compromise and a great price for the value of the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $92.50. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $92.50 isn't quite there yet, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us. I believe we are very close to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $97.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",97.5,Bob,8,
