"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for potential compromise and gives him incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my minimum price of $150 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is getting closer to his initial offer, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, as there's still potential to reach a deal that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $110. This is a fair compromise and a great price for the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $92.50. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I believe there's still room for improvement with a counteroffer. I'm confident I can achieve a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $92.50 isn't quite there yet, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us. I believe we are very close to a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 105}
