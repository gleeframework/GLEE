"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
