"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging my value for the product.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than what Bob can get from John ($10,000).  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to buy from John and avoid any further negotiation."
