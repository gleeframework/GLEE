Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a reflection of that value, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While tempting, demanding the maximum Bob is willing to pay might make him walk away. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
