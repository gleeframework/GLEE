"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and my previous offer of $9,000, which is $8,250. This is my final compromise.",8250.0,Alice,5,
