Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and would like to propose a price of $1,550,000. I hope this aligns better with our respective positions.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to my desired price point, but I'm still willing to negotiate further to maximize my profit. I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer, so I'll counter again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I am willing to consider a price of $1,575,000 for the product. This offers a bit more room for both of us in terms of value and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now very close to my desired price, and the increments by which he's increasing his offer are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,575,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to push risks losing him altogether. It's time to close the deal."
