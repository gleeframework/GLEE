"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're having a conversation, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $110? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",110.0,Alice,7,
