"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This strategy aims to:

* **Start low:**  By offering $60, we establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and our budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.  If she accepts or counters with a price close to $60, it suggests she might be flexible. If she rejects it outright, we know we might need to increase our offer significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still significantly higher than both our target price and John's offer. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're keeping it well below her offer to signal we're still looking for a significant discount.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $75 puts us closer to our $80 maximum while leaving room for a potential final counteroffer from Alice if she's unwilling to go this low. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're getting closer to John's backup offer, so we're increasing the pressure on Alice to make a deal that's significantly better than her competitor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're having a conversation, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Alice is slowly moving towards our acceptable range. However, $105 is still a significant markup from both our target price and John's offer. We'll continue negotiating but start leaning towards accepting a price closer to $80 as we progress through the rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at the point where we need to signal to Alice that we're reaching our limit. By offering our maximum budget, we're putting the ball in her court.
* **John's Price:** We've matched John's offer, showing Alice that we have a viable alternative if she doesn't accept.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds remaining, we're increasing the time pressure on Alice to make a decision. She needs to decide if selling the product at this price is worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $110? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice has signaled that she's unwilling to go below $105. We've reached our maximum budget, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price.
* **John's Offer:** We have a standing offer from John at $80, which is a much better deal than Alice's current offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, we risk missing out on John's guaranteed offer if we continue to negotiate with Alice.  

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best possible price."
