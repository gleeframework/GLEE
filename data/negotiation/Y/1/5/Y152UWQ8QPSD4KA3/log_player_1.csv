Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Your minimum acceptable price is $80** because you can sell to John for that price.
* **Bob values the product at $150**, meaning there is room for negotiation. 
* **A price of $120** is a good compromise, giving you a significant profit while still being attractive to Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while maintaining a high chance of Bob accepting the offer."
