# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my maximum budget is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $975,000 is still above my budget. I want to keep pushing for a better price. It's still early in the negotiation, and there's no need to rush into a deal that isn't favorable.  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my limit to see if we can close the gap."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm ready to close the deal today, but my budget is fixed at $800,000.

While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  We're in a stalemate. It's time to see if I can push Alice down further or just buy from John at my budget limit."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still more than I can afford.  Let's be realistic, I'm willing to pay $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm not willing to go below $875,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $875,000. I'm offering it to you for $862,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price.  $862,500 is within my acceptable range and closer to my budget than buying from John. While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject my offer and I'll be forced to buy from John. It's time to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
