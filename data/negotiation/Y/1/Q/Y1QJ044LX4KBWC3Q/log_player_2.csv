{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product to me and gives you a considerable discount. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $725,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $800,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the value the product holds for you. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

At this point, Alice has met your maximum price. There is no benefit to trying to negotiate further, as you can get the product for the same price from John.  Accepting Alice's offer closes the deal."
