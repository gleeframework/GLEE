Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I still have time to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product to me and gives you a considerable discount. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $725,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $800,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the value the product holds for you. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
