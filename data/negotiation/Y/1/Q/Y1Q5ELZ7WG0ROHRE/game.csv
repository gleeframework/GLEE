"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm prepared to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $8500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9200. Would you be willing to consider that?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8800.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still significantly less than what John is selling it for.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,4,
