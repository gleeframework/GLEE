Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've set a floor of $8,000, and $12,000 is significantly higher.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so he has room to bargain and potentially reach a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a specific price, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.

Remember, you can always lower your price later if Bob counters with a lower offer, but it's generally better to start high and work your way down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, it's still lower than what you initially offered and what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range.  

You can use the information Bob provided to formulate a counteroffer that is likely to be more appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to be flexible while still protecting your interests.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  By emphasizing that $11,000 is still a great deal for him, you're reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""make this happen"" promotes a collaborative and optimistic tone."
