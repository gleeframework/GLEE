"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your original price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $10,000 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
