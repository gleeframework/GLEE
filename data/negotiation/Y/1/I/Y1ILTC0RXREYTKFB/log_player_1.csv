Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being substantially higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Time Value of Money:** A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price than John's offer, has its advantages. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes a degree of risk tolerance. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading to a sale at the guaranteed price to John."
