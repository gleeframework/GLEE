"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 was a bit too high, but I can do $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I can offer $970000. This is my best and final offer.",970000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher, but $970000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980000 and $970000, so I can offer it to you for $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $975000. I can offer $960000, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. This is my final offer.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $990000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle.",990000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $990000. I've already offered you $960000 and $970000, and I'm not going to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",980000.0,Bob,10,
