"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,500,000 to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,260,000? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",1260000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,260,000 is a reasonable compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer you the product for $1,280,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
