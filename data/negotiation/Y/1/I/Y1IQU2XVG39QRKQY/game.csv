"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's start at $800,000 and see if we can find common ground. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference and go with $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that respects both our positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's a reasonable compromise from my original offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
