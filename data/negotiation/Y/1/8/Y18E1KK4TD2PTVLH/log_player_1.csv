Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's a fair compromise between my minimum price and the product's value to Bob.  I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, showing flexibility but still pushing for a price closer to my target. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90. While it's still lower than my initial target, it's better than selling to John for $80.  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to push for a higher price."
