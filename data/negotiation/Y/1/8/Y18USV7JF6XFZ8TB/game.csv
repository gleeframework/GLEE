"I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll meet you at $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  That's a significant discount from your original price and a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $16,250. It's a small increase, but it's the best I can do. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $16,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $16,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal right now.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,050. It's a small increase from your previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16050.0,Alice,7,
