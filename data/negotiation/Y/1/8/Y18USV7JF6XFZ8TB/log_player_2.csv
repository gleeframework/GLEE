"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I think it's a fair deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $15,000 from John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll meet you at $17,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate further. There are still 7 rounds left, and he can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  That's a significant discount from your original price and a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $16,250. It's a small increase, but it's the best I can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's already shown that he's willing to pay up to $16,000, and Alice is only $250 away from that. There are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can continue to push for a better price. He can likely get closer to his $16,000 target with a few more counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $16,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $16,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal right now."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,050. It's a small increase from your previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's only $50 more than his previous offer of $16,000, and he's already spent several rounds negotiating.  With only 3 rounds left, he might not be able to get a lower price.  Also, buying from John would cost him the same amount, and there is no guarantee that he'll get a better deal from Alice later."
