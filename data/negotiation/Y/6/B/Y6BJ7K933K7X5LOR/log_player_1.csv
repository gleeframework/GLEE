Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's a bold move, hoping to pique Bob's interest and start the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's far below my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product, and this counteroffer should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I believe I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with this offer. It's a significant decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating a commitment to reaching a deal.  However, it's still above my minimum. I believe this counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court and might convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I've already lowered my price significantly.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000. It's a safe and secure option, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
