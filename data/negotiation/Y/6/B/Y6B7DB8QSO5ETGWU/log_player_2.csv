"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You know John will sell you the same product for $800,000, which is the best possible price for you.  There's no need to negotiate with Alice further."
