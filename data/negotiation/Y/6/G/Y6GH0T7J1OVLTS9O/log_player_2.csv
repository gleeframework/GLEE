Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a price of $925,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the market value, and I believe it offers a fair compromise. Please let me know if this revised price meets your requirements.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still within your budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next offer and you'll end up paying more than $925,000.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
