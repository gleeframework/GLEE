"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for significant negotiation room and sets a strong starting point. It's crucial to remember that I'm aiming for as much profit as possible while also considering the possibility of a counteroffer from Bob.  If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate based on his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  The option of selling to John at $1,500,000 is a safety net, but I'm hoping to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to hold out for a much higher price.  $500,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000, let alone the $2,000,000 I initially aimed for. I'm rejecting this offer and will counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's lowball offer. It signals that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly. This price should be attractive to Bob, but still allows for some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds. I'll need to carefully assess his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value and what I believe the product is worth. I'm rejecting his offer and will continue to negotiate for a higher price. I still have several rounds left, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum. I'm willing to accept this price because it is my minimum value for the product. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal but that I'm not going to sell it for less than what it's worth to me.  If he rejects this, I will sell to John.  This offer puts the pressure on Bob and gives me a chance to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum and guarantees me a profit. It's time to cut my losses and move on.  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it seems he's not willing to meet my price. It's best to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
