"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000, but I need to be honest with you, if we don't come to an agreement, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $800,000. I'm hoping we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To be frank, I'm aiming to keep this under $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to keep the price under $1,000,000, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the price, but I have a tight budget.  My final offer is $975,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will add significant value to the product. If you're still interested, I can meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
