"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and discuss further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
