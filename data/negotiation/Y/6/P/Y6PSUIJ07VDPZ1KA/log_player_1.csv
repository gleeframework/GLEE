Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to be confident in the product's value without seeming overly aggressive or greedy."
