"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was a bit steep for you, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $130 is still a little more than I want to spend. How about $125? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $125, but I'm not ready to accept that just yet. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $135. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you.",135.0,Alice,5,
