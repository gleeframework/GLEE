"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $90 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  That's still a great price for such a valuable product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $110. I'd be willing to meet you at $100. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $100 is closer, but I'm still looking for something a little higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not willing to go up to $105. I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer of $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95. That's the highest I'm willing to go.,95.0,Bob,6,
