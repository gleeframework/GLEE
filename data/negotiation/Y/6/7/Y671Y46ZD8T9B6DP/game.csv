"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close, but I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
