"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to its market value. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is significantly below its true value, I understand we need to find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,600,000? This reflects the product's unique aspects and potential for return.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit, but $1,600,000 is still far beyond what I had in mind. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about the investment. Would you consider $750,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart on price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, but I need to see you move closer to my valuation as well. Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
