{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above my budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, as I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $18,000, it's still well above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a price closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, $14,000 is still too high. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a price closer to my target of $8,000.  If I can't get it down further, I'll still have the option of buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $13,000.  This is my absolute top limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my target of $8,000, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I've only got a few rounds left, but I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal.  If not, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,725 is still significantly higher than my target of $8,000, and I'm running out of rounds. It's more beneficial to me to buy from John at $8,000 to ensure I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
