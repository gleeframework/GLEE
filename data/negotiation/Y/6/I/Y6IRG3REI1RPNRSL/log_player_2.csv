"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  I'm really looking for a good deal, and I think that's fair considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a good price considering you are willing to pay up to $150.  While you could try to negotiate further, there is a risk Alice will reject and you'll be left with John's higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price."
