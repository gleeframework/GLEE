"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a very fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
