"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit.  $1,200,000 is a significant price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the value to Bob helps him see the potential benefit of the deal. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly approach can encourage Bob to engage. 

**Note:**  This is just the initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:** While $900,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my target and what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **More room for negotiation:** There are still 9 rounds left, and I believe there's potential to get a higher price.
* **Staying firm:** Accepting now would mean leaving a lot of money on the table.  I'm going to try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a very fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but still maintain value:**  I'm dropping the price, but not by a huge margin.  $1,050,000 is still closer to my target and leaves room for a final compromise if needed.
* **Reiterate the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the benefits he'll gain, hoping to sway him toward a higher price.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm remaining friendly and optimistic, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:**  Bob is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not satisfied.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  We have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a higher price.  
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:**  Accepting now might leave me with regret, as I believe a more favorable outcome is possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise, but still holding ground:** I'm only dropping the price by $50,000, showing I'm serious about getting a good price but also willing to be reasonable.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair for both of us, which could appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Closing pressure:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting we close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $985,000 to get this deal done today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're close, but not there yet:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, but I still have room to push for a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:** With 5 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Risk of settling too soon:**  While $985,000 is a good offer, accepting now might leave me with regret if I could have gotten more in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference at $992,500?  That's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 992500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Sense of urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the need to close the deal, hoping to push Bob towards accepting.
* **Maintaining value:** While I'm lowering my price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. 

**Note:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between securing a good price and avoiding a stalemate. This compromise should feel like a win for both of us."
