"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that my initial offer was a fair one. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000.

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to consider your request. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
