Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with my ideal price, $1,000,000. While I know Bob values it lower, it's my baseline and gives me room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and consider whether to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to sell for $1,000,000, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. It's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to the middle ground. This should encourage further negotiation while still protecting my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to negotiate more, I'm getting close to John's offer.  Selling to John guarantees the highest profit at this point, so I'll take it."
