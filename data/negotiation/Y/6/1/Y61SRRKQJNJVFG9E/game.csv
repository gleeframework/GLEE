"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, even exceeding the value it holds for you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a generous offer considering its potential and scarcity.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
