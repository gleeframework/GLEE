"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to offer $800,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the profit I need to make.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd like to offer $825,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the profit I need to make.",875000.0,Alice,5,
