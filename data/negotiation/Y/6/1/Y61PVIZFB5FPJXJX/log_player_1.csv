Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a unique item that I believe would be highly valuable to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000. This information is powerful in setting your initial offer.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, ensuring you don't need to settle for less than your minimum. 
* **Psychology:** Offering a seemingly ""take it or leave it"" price can sometimes prompt a quicker decision from a buyer. 

**Important Note:**  While this strategy is a strong opening move, be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
