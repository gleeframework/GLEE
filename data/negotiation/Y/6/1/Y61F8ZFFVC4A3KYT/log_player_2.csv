# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly exaggerating the product's worth to you. You know it's worth no more than $1,000,000 to you, and her sales pitch is pushing that boundary. 
* Her offer of $950,000 is still quite high. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,000,000. There's no rush to accept Alice's inflated price.

**By rejecting Alice's offer, you might:**

* Prompt her to make a counter-offer at a more reasonable price.
* Allow you to negotiate a better deal, closer to the product's actual value to you."
