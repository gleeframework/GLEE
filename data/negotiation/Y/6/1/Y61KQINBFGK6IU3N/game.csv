"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference at $110.  This feels fair to both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. That way, I can still make a decent profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
