{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the $15,000 value for Bob, but I'm also aware of John's offer of $12,000 as a safety net.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? That's still a significant saving for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so how about $12,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,200 is close enough to my minimum of $12,000 and John's offer.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
