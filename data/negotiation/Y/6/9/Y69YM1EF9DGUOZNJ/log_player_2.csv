# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Considering its potential, I'm initially offering it at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, so accepting it would not be the most cost-effective solution.  Since there's room for negotiation, rejecting her offer allows you to attempt to secure a better price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than my ideal price.  While it's closer to my budget, I want to try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to $850,000."
