"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $950,000 is a bold move, but it's within his budget and leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for further negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and secure a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget with each round.  $975,000 is a compromise that's still significantly less than Alice's last offer.  It shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, and with only 5 rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer from her are slim.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
