"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for sale. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $160?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $160, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $165.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $165, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit higher than that. How about we try $172.50?",172.5,Alice,5,
