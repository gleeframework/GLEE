"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,500 is still too high for him. He can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8500? I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm still a bit above the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I can do $9000 for you, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not his ideal price, it's still lower than John's price and closer to his own valuation of the product.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Alice will walk away or counter with an even higher price."
