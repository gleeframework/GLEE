"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a profitable sale.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a friendly and optimistic note. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm confident this is a strong starting point, I'll need to assess Bob's reaction and adapt my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $90 is closer to my minimum price ($100), it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  
* **Reject and Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and hopefully get closer to my target price.

**Next Round:**

* I will use the next round to send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $90 and my initial offer of $110.  I'll adjust the specific price based on how confident I am in closing the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's last offer ($90). This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Message:**  The message is still positive and focuses on the benefits of the deal for both of us.  I'm emphasizing fairness to hopefully encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further, stick with my minimum ($100), or sell to John.  My decision will depend on how determined Bob seems to be and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $95 is very close to my minimum price of $100.  While I'd ideally get $100, accepting this offer will still allow me to make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation.
* **Selling to John:**  While I could sell to John for $100, there's a chance I might be able to secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. 
* **Negotiation Risk:**  I've already rejected two offers from Bob, and further rejection could potentially lead to a stalemate or a lower final price.

**Decision:**  Considering the proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum and the potential for further negotiation risk, accepting his offer is the best strategy at this point."
