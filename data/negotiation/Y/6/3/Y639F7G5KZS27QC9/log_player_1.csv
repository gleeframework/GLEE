Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a worthwhile investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully and act quickly."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have a strong position.  Your goal is to see if Bob will pay a premium over your minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts.  
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to its value to him ($1,000,000).
    * You make a $150,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act swiftly and reduces the chance he'll try to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you still have a guaranteed sale to John at your desired minimum price."
