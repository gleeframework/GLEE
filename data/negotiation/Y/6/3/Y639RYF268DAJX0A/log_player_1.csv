"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible outcome.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this initial offer allows room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept that. While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, I'd like to try and get more from Bob. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's still less than what I initially wanted, but  given the remaining rounds, it's a good deal.  I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity."
