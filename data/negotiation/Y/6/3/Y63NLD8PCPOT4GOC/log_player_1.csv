"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a higher price. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10,750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $10,750 is a good deal and still above the price John is offering.  It's important to reach a compromise to ensure a successful negotiation."
