"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let me know if that works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $125. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
