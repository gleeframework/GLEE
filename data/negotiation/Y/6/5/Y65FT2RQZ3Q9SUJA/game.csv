"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for the right price. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to keep it under $10,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get closer to my target price of $9,000. How about we meet at $10,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
