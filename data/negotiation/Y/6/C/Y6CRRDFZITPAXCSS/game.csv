"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's worth a substantial investment, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential returns.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is a bit high for me. To make this work, I'd need to come in at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's potential and your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $1300000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product and the cost savings we could both achieve.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1300000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's potential and the initial offer I made.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
