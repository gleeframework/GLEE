"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a more flexible proposal. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable margin for my business. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $825,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with both our interests.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $762,500?",762500.0,Bob,4,
