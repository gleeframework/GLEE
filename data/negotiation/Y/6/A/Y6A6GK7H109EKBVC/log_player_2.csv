"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is offering it for $14,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to get a better deal, so rejecting the offer allows for potential savings. 
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you still have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a significant counteroffer:**  You're aiming for a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. A $1,000 drop shows your seriousness in negotiating but leaves room for further bargaining.
* **Staying within your budget:** This price is still below your maximum limit of $15,000, ensuring you're not overpaying. 
* **Assessing Alice's response:**  Alice's reaction to this counteroffer will indicate how flexible she is and if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's moved slightly from her previous offer, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Time for another counteroffer:** You have more rounds to negotiate, and by rejecting this offer, you can try to push for a lower price again.
* **Staying within your budget:** You're still comfortable with the risk of buying from John, so you're not pressured to accept anything above your limit.
* **Aiming for the middle ground:**  Alice's offer suggests she might be willing to compromise, making it worthwhile to try another counteroffer closer to the middle ground between your last offer and hers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  By offering $13,500, you're splitting the difference between your last offer ($13,000) and Alice's latest offer ($14,500). This demonstrates your willingness to compromise.
* **Staying within your budget:** This offer remains within your maximum price limit, minimizing your risk. 
* **Assessing Alice's flexibility:**  Alice's response to this counteroffer will reveal how close you are to reaching an agreeable price and if she's prepared to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is your maximum limit.**  She's offering the product at the price you're willing to pay, but no lower.
* **No further negotiation is likely:**  Alice has shown a reluctance to lower her price significantly, making further counteroffers unlikely to succeed.
* **John offers the same price:**  Since John is offering the product at the same price, there's no advantage to continuing to negotiate with Alice.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Buying from John guarantees you get the product without further delays or potential for further negotiations that might not result in a better price."
