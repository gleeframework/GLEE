"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me start by offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer and potential for a more favorable price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
