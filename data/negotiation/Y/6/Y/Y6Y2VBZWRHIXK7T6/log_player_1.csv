Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a potential saving of $1,000, making it an attractive deal. This price also earns you a significant profit.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($12,000) if Bob rejects your proposal, ensuring you don't lose out completely."
