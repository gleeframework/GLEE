Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1750000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1375000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This offer is a significant compromise from my initial asking price and should be within your budget.  Let's try to make this deal work.
