"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product,  which is a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference and settle on $1375000.  I believe this price is fair considering both our positions and would allow us to close this deal efficiently. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000 at this point.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm also starting to feel like John might be the better option, but I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,375,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $1500000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close the deal within my budget.  Let's reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

This is a great offer from Bob, it meets my minimum price point and I have no reason to go back and forth further. It's time to close the deal!"
