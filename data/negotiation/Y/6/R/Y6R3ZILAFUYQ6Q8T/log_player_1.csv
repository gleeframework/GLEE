"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the value of the product to me. It allows for a potential profit while also considering the fact that Bob values the product higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I will counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe $1,400,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer secures a profit of $150,000, which is a significant gain.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal altogether to John is too high."
