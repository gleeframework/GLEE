"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1050000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1075000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
