Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment at a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's maximum ($1,100,000) allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum. 

By setting the initial price high, you aim to secure the best possible deal from Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
