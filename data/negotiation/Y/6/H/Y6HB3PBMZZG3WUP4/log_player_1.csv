"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to offer it to you at the special price of $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $120 for it. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his maximum budget of $120, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's little incentive to continue negotiating, as I'm unlikely to get a better offer from him. Selling to John ensures I get my desired minimum without wasting time on further negotiation."
