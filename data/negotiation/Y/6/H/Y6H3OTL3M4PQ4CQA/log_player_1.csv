Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  This price demonstrates an understanding of the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive, which could scare him off.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a strong fallback with John at $1,000,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
