"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Alice's offer is higher than that, so it's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range that's reasonable for both parties.  It leaves room for negotiation, but also demonstrates a willingness to be serious about the purchase.  By offering a lower price, you're also signaling that you're aware of the value of the product and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000.  It's more advantageous to buy from John, saving $25,000. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
