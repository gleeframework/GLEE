"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase it. However, based on my research and personal valuation, I am only willing to pay $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your valuation. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline at $16000. Based on my assessment, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my initial proposal of $8000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between these figures?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
