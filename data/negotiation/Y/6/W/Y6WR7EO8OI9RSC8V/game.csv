"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $875,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little over budget. I'm prepared to offer you $860,000. This is my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced we're at a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a deal.",880000.0,Alice,5,
