"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price limit.**  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  You have 10 rounds, so rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This gives you a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A $20 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point. It shows you're serious about negotiating but also acknowledges the product's potential value. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Leaving space for further negotiation allows for potential compromise in the following rounds.
* **Avoiding ""too low"" offers:**  A significantly lower offer might risk Alice immediately rejecting and making the negotiation more difficult."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your maximum.**  $90 is within your budget, and a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or the negotiation will drag on.
* **Time constraint:**  You have limited rounds, and each rejection takes you closer to having to buy from John at full price.  

This decision balances getting a good price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
