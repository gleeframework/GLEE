"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still leaves me with a significant profit. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our values.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I still get a fair return on my product.  How about $1,400,000?  That's still well below your estimated value and gives us both a good outcome.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,375,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
