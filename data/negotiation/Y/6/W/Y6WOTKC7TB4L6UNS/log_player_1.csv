Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still leaves me with a significant profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is too low, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I still get a fair return on my product.  How about $1,400,000?  That's still well below your estimated value and gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on my calculations, I am willing to consider $1,350,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,375,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered your proposal and I'm willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $1,360,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $10,000 less than my last counteroffer, and I'm worried that if I reject it, we may not be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if this deal falls through."
