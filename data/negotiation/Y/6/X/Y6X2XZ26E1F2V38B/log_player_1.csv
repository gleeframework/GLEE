Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

This approach is based on the following logic:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a higher price gives me the potential for greater profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  By starting high, I have room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **Worst Case Scenario:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John, so I'm not taking a significant risk.

Let's see what Bob decides!"
