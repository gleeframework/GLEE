Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's still significantly more than the product is worth to Bob, but it also gives me some room to negotiate if necessary. I'm confident I can get a better price than $15,000 from John, so I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to get a higher price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer, but still leaving me with a profit above my minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's value and my need to earn more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a price lower than John's offer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to secure a guaranteed profit."
