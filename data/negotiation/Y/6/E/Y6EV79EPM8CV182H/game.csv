"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Considering the potential value of this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding common ground, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me at this stage.  Considering the product's potential value to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
