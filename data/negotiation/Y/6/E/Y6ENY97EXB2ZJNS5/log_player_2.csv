"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than both your walk-away price and Alice's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to your target price while still leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is still significantly above your target price. While her offer has come down, there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

We're getting closer! This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer and our last one. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below our walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tricky one. Alice is employing a common tactic by stating the product is worth $12,000 to me, trying to anchor my perception of its value. However, I know my walk-away price is $12,000.  There's still some room to negotiate, and I'm willing to push a bit further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you have a bottom line, Alice, and I respect that.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,750? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to agree on that price."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

This counter-offer:

* **Acknowledges Alice's position**: Showing you understand and respect her limit helps build rapport and trust.
* **Proposes a specific compromise**: Splitting the difference again demonstrates a willingness to negotiate fairly. 
* **Conveys a sense of urgency**: Saying you're ""ready to agree"" at this price adds a bit of pressure for Alice to accept. 

This is a calculated risk.  We're getting closer to our limit, but it's still a better deal than John's offer.  It will be interesting to see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but that's as high as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're close enough:** $9,200 is only $200 away from our last offer and significantly below our walk-away price of $12,000. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Alice is signaling this is her final offer. Pushing harder could make her walk away, forcing us to accept John's less favorable deal. 
* **A good deal is better than no deal:** Holding out for another $200 might not be worth the risk of losing the product altogether. 

While we didn't get our ideal price, this negotiation outcome still saves us $2,800 compared to John's offer."
