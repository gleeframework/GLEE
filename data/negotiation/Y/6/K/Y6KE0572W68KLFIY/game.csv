"Alice, your product sounds great, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1050000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  Let's try to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is a bit above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
