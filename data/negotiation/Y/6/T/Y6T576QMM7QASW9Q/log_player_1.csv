{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and what the product is worth to Bob.  I'm also being friendly to encourage a positive negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $8,000, and it seems like he's truly interested in the product.  It's better to secure the sale at $9,000 than to risk a lengthy negotiation that might end up with me selling to John for less."
