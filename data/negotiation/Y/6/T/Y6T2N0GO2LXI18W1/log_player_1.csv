Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, you aim to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly mentioning that you'll list the product publicly if Bob declines creates a sense of scarcity and a small incentive for him to act quickly. 

While you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming higher initially maximizes your potential profit."
