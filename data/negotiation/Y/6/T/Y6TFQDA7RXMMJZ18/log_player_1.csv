Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high demand and value, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You earn a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down to a price still comfortably above $800,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price. 

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still ensuring you don't lose the sale."
