"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your budget, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be honest, $10,000 is still quite low for me, and I'm making a significant compromise.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $12,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and yours - $11,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
