Alice's offer is way too high, and I'm definitely not going to accept that. It's time to counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your budget, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$14,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll try to get closer to my budget with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be honest, $10,000 is still quite low for me, and I'm making a significant compromise.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not ready to accept it. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $12,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and yours - $11,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
