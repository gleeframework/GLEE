Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the higher price. 

This strategy attempts to secure the best possible outcome with Bob, knowing I have a safety net with John if needed."
