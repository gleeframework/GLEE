Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm asking for $950,000, an investment reflecting its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Slightly below John's offer:** Offering it slightly below John's price ($950,000) makes it seem like a good deal to Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Value-based language:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant returns"" aims to justify the high price to Bob. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a much higher profit than selling to John."
