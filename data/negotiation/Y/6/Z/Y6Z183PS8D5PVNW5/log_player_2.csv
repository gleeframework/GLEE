"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $140. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $140.  You can get it for cheaper from John.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $132.50 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  Since I can get the product from John for $120, it's best to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation."
