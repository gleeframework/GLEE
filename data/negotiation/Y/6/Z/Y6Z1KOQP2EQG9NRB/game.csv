"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $90?  I'm really hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to make this work too.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's try to close this deal!",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $92.50 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me at $91?  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
