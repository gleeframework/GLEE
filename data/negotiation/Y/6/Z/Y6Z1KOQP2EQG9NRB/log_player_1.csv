"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone helps build rapport. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I've highlighted the potential value of the product to Bob, which might encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation room:** I want to leave some room for negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John's offer:** While $100 from John is a guaranteed sale, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum of $100. This shows I'm open to negotiation but also  firm on my value.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $90?  I'm really hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is still under my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's offer:** While I'm getting closer, John's offer of $100 guarantees me a higher profit with no risk. 
* **Negotiation window:** I still have some rounds left and a good chance of potentially getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to make this work too.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we close the deal, reminding Bob that we're getting closer to the end of our negotiation window. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $92.50 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me at $91?  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer of $91 is very close to John's offer of $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll accept my next offer. It's getting risky.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John offers a sure thing. Selling to him guarantees me a profit of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

It's time to lock in the deal and avoid the possibility of a lower offer from Bob or a potential breakdown in negotiations."
