"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $120, so you have room to bargain. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102 is better than $110, I'm still hoping to get the price down further. I have room to negotiate since I'm willing to pay up to $120.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue bargaining with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $102 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $98.  This feels like a fair price that's within both of our budgets."", ""product_price"": 98}
