"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can make a decision right away.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $127. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",127.0,Alice,5,
