"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time. I believe this price is fair given my current budget and the potential value of this product to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1400000 for this product, and I believe this price is fair given the value it holds for my business. Let's meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $1400000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1650000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still allowing me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $1650000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1500000 for this product. I'm confident this price is fair and represents a good value for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that's reasonable. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
