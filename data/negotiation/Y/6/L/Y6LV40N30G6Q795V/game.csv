,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the product's potential significantly.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $1,100,000. I think that's still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer. I'd like to emphasize that I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
