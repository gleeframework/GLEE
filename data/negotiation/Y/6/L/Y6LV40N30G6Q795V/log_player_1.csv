Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While we could push for more in further rounds, accepting $1,075,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's a $75,000 profit over our minimum and John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation lowering the price.
* **Negotiation Success:** We've moved Bob up from $1,050,000, showing our willingness to compromise while still achieving a favorable outcome."
