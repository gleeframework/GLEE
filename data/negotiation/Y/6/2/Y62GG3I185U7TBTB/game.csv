"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $110? It's a good price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal that I think you'll find hard to pass up.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to $120. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price considering the value the product offers, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item.",125.0,Alice,5,
