"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've said the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $975,000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
