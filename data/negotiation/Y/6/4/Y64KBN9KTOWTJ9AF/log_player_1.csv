Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I let it go for $112.50?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still can't go above $100 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I've already lowered my price significantly. While I could keep trying, it seems like the negotiation is going nowhere.  Selling to John ensures I get a guaranteed $100, which is better than potentially getting nothing if I continue negotiating with Bob and he ultimately rejects my offer."
