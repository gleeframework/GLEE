"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price:** This means there's room for negotiation and potential savings.
* **You have 10 rounds:**  There's time to explore a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you can start a counteroffer negotiation and aim for a price closer to your $1,000,000 threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (600,000) than Alice's initial offer (800,000) shows your intention to negotiate aggressively and potentially get a better deal.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While this counteroffer is ambitious, it still leaves space for Alice to counter and reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** A lower counteroffer increases the chance of Alice rejecting it, but it also sets a higher potential for saving money. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy is risky. It's a gamble that Alice is willing to negotiate significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price:** While closer to your target, $750,000 is still above your ideal price point.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate:** You've already established your willingness to negotiate and have 7 rounds remaining. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you signal your commitment to finding a more favorable price.  You can now counteroffer again, aiming for a number closer to your preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  Increase your counteroffer incrementally. A $50,000 increase shows you're willing to compromise but are still aiming for a lower price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to meet you halfway.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Continuing the negotiation process keeps the pressure on Alice and signals that you're serious about finding a deal.

**Important Note:** If Alice rejects this offer, you'll need to consider if your next counteroffer should be a more substantial jump or a smaller increment.  Assess her reaction to your previous offer to make the best decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your ideal price:** While still higher than your ideal, $725,000 is getting closer to the price you're aiming for.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** You've already used half of your rounds, and time is running out.

This is a strategic decision. Accepting the offer ensures you secure the product at a reasonable price, but it's possible you could get an even lower price if you continue negotiating. However, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional discount."
