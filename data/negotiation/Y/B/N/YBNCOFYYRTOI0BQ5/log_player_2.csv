"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is under your $10,000 limit, you know you have a backup option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, getting you a better deal."
