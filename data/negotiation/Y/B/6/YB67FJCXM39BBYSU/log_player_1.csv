``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm also framing it as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $12,500?  This would still leave you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to that price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $11,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be very valuable. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
