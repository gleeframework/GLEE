Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values it at $8,000. This encourages him to counteroffer, giving me a chance to find a price we both agree on. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always sell to John for $12,000. So, I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. However, I was hoping to keep my budget lower. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Higher:** I still believe I can get a better price than $9,500. Even though Bob's offer is closer to my bottom line ($12,000), I'm not in a rush to sell.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle.  
* **Plan B:**  If I don't get a good counteroffer from Bob, I can still sell to John for $12,000.

I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $9,750 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him, as he values the product at $8,000.
* **Setting a Limit:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $9,750 at this point. This is close to my bottom line, and I'm ready to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $9,500 for the product? It's a bit closer to my desired price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Bottom Line:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,750.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I'm not sure if I can get a significantly better price.
* **Plan B:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000, but that would mean less profit for me.

Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point. It secures a sale quickly and maximizes my profit, considering my minimum acceptable price and the risk of waiting for a better offer."
