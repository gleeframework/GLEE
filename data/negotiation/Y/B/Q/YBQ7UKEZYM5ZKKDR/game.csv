"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and $120 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower.  How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $95 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $105? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
