You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $95 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $105? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105. It's better to secure the product from John for $100 and avoid further back-and-forth with Alice."
