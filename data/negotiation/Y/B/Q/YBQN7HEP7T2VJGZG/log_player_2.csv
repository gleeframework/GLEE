You have three options:

Alice's offer is more than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $105. Let's make this happen!

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still over your ideal price point.  You can likely get it for closer to $100 by continuing to negotiate."
