"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that can significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $12,000 for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, so it's best to reject Alice's offer and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product more accessible to you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he's willing to pay.  He has a clear target of $8,000, and he can still get that from John.  Therefore, it's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To accommodate your budget, I am willing to lower the price to $10,000 for the product. This still offers a good return for us, while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for the $8,000 price point.  While $10,000 is closer, he has a backup option with John and can continue negotiating with Alice. It's possible that Alice will come down further, or Bob can make another counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate you working with me. While $10,000 is getting closer to my budget, I can only go up to $9,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
