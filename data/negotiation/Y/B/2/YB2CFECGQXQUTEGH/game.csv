"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product more accessible to you. Please let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. To accommodate your budget, I am willing to lower the price to $10,000 for the product. This still offers a good return for us, while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate you working with me. While $10,000 is getting closer to my budget, I can only go up to $9,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
