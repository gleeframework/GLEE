Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I recognize its value, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair offer, considering I can buy it from John at that price.

Bob is unwilling to budge past his valuation, even though he knows I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.  It's time to move on to John."
