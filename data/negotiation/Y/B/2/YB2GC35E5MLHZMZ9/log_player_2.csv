"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  $14,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.
* **There are more rounds to negotiate.**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  Bob has this as a backup if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. How about $13,000? I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject and the price might go back up.
* **John's offer is a safe option, but not the best.**  Bob can get the product for a lower price from Alice. 

At this point, it's a good risk/reward calculation. Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John, and there's a chance that he could get the price down further in the next few rounds."
