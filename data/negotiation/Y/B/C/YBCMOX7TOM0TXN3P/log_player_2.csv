"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This gives us both a good deal, and I know you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within my budget and a good price for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept her offer."
