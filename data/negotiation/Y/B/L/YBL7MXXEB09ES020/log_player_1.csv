Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to keep my investment under $1,000,000. Let's start with $1,100,000. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value you place on the product.  I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm open to discussing it further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This price would allow both of us to secure a good deal. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get him to come up a bit more in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value I place on this product. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000.  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
