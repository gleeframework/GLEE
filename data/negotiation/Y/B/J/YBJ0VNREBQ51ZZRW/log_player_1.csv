Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might get me a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is still a significant profit above my minimum ($150). This price gives Bob a perceived discount while still netting me a good return. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling quickly to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, can be more advantageous than waiting for a guaranteed sale to John.

By setting the price at $140, I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
