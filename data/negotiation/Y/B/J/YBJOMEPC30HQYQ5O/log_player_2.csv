"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since the product is worth $100 to you. You can likely get a better price than $95."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?

While $90 is better than $95, it's still above your target price of $80.  You should try to negotiate further with Alice."
