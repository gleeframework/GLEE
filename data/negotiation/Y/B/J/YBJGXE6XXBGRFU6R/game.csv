"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product for a price of $950,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, and I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still represents a great deal for you, given the product's value to your business.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $875,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I understand we're close, but $875,000 just isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference at $887,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $880,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
