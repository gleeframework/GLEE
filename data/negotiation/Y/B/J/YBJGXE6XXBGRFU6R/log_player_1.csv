Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still represents a great deal for you, given the product's value to your business.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $875,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round.  I want to get as close as possible to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I understand we're close, but $875,000 just isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference at $887,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 887500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $880,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $887,500.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept it rather than risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer of $800,000."
