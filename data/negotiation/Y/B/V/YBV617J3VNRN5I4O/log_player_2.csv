"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.**  $9,250 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer of $9,000 and closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.
* **Risk of going to John:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge and Bob could end up paying John $12,000.
* **Time is running out:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer provides a good deal and avoids the risk of running out of time.

**Overall:** Accepting the offer is the most logical choice, as it balances the desire to save money with the potential risks of continued negotiation."
