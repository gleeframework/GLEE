"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $9,500. How about we aim for $8,500? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is too low for me. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not yet at the point where I'm willing to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it leaves me some room to make a profit. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $8,750 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you can consider this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not ready to accept Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $8,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $8,900. This would be a win-win for both of us, and we could finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
