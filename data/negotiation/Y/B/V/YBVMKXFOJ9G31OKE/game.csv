"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,000,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'd like.  How about meeting halfway between our last offers at $2,000,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial ask and recognizes the value this product brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we seem to be reaching an impasse. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. However, I also have other interested buyers, and if this offer isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider those opportunities.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
