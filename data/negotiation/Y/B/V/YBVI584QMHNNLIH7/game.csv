"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a fair price, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
