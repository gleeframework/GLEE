"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential gains. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $1,075,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  The value of this product is undeniable.  Let's try $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to go up slightly more, but I need to see some movement on your end too. How about $1,100,000?  That's my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
