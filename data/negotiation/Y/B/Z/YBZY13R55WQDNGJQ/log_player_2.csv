# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above my maximum budget. I can try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down any further, and I'm not comfortable risking a stalemate. Therefore, it's more prudent to buy the product from John at his fixed price of $1,000,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
