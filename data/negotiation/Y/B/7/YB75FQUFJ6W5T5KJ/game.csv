"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $10,500 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking $14,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's keep this negotiation going.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  If we can agree on this price, I'm happy to seal the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $13,000 is still a little high. How about we settle at $12,500? That's the best I can do.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still slightly below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a little further and come down to $12,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",12800.0,Alice,7,
