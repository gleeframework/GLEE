"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $7,000. How about $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  However, $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I think we're getting close, though. How about we meet in the middle between $7,500 and $8,000? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,800.",7800.0,Alice,5,
