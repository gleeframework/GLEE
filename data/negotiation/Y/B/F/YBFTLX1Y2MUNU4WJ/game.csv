"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a counteroffer of $825,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you can understand my position. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to meet you closer to your price. Would you consider $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a counteroffer of $815,000.
