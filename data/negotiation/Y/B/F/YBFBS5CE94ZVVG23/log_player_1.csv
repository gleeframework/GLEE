"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this will encourage Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us and hopefully avoid further rounds of back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
