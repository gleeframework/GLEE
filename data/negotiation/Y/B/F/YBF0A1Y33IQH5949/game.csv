,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $130. That's still a great price for this product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $120.  This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll get good use out of it.  Let's meet in the middle at $120, and we can close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
