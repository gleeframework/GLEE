Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $80 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $150."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $130. That's still a great price for this product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
