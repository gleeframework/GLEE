"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
