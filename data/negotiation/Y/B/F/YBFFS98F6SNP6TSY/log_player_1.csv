Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering at $175. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price or having to sell to John.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
