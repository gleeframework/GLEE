Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to counter if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than my initial offer and closer to his own valuation. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,200 is slightly better than what John is offering, and it's getting close to my minimum.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
