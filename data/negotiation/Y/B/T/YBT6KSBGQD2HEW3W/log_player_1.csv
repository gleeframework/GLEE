Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation ($14,000) maximizes the chance of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While John offers a safety net at $12,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is preferable.
* **One-Shot Deal:** This is a single negotiation. There's no indication of further bargaining rounds. A strong initial offer increases the chance of a quick, favorable outcome."
