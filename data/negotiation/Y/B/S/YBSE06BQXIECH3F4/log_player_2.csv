"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is less than the $1,000,000 you'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down further by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a significant price reduction. It's more than Alice's minimum value of $800,000, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. This aggressive approach aims to see if Alice is willing to make a quick deal and potentially push her towards accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than what John is offering and still leaves a reasonable profit margin for Alice. Continuing to negotiate might result in further price drops, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
