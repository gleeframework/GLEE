"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer,  $8,500 is a bit low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $9,250.  Let me know if that works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,250 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
