Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still provides substantial value to Bob (a significant gain from his perceived worth of $800,000).
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates urgency and encourages Bob to decide quickly."
