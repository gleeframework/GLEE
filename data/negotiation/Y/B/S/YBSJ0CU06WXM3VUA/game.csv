"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you say?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for a product like this.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, though. Would you be willing to go down to $110? It's a fair compromise, and we could both be happy with the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $110 is still below what I can accept for this product. How about $115? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's make this happen!",112.0,Bob,6,
