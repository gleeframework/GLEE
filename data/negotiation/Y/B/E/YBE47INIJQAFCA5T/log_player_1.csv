Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving you the opportunity to bargain.
* **It's not too high:** This price may make Bob more likely to accept and avoid a protracted negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. Keep in mind John's $10,000 offer as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
