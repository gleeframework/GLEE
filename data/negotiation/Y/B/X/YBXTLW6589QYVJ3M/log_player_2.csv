"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $8000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is offering $9,000, which is still above Bob's desired price. He has already indicated he wants to pay $8,000 and Alice has rejected that. There's a good chance they'll continue to haggle, but Bob is guaranteed the lowest price from John and has the advantage of buying it immediately."
