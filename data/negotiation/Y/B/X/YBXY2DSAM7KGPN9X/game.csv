"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I believe you'll find it highly valuable as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to profit from the sale. I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. It allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm hoping we can close this deal this round.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",990000.0,Bob,6,
