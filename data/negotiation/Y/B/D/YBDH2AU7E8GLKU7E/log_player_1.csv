Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get.  I think I can still get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,500. This is a final compromise, as it's only $500 more than Bob's last offer. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm worried that if I counteroffer again, he'll just continue to lower the price, and I'll end up selling it to John for less than I'd like. So, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting an even lower offer from Bob."
