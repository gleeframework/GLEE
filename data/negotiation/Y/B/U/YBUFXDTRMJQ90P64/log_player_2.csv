"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than his maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further concessions if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, but still above what Bob is aiming for. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can secure a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,500, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. This offer is still below Alice's latest counteroffer, demonstrating that Bob is actively negotiating. The goal is to find a price that works for both parties without resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. However, Bob is still hoping to secure a better price.  He's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final attempt to bridge the gap between his desired price and Alice's offer. At $10,000, he's offering a price that's closer to her perceived value while still saving a significant amount compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely have to buy from John to avoid further risk of exceeding his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting dangerously close to Bob's maximum budget. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of going over budget becomes too high. While Bob could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept.  Buying from John at $12,000 ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget. It's the most logical choice at this point."
