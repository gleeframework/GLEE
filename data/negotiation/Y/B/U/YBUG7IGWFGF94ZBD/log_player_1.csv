Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob without giving away too much of the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at a point where it's just slightly lower than my counteroffer and is a good price that's closer to my initial target. It's unlikely that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round, so accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
