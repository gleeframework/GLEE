"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $13,000 is closer but still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's split the difference and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob should accept Alice's offer. $13,500 is still a better price than buying from John for $15,000, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price."
