# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but there's room for negotiation.  $800,000 is still a significant profit for Alice, and I can likely get a better deal.  I'll reject and try to counteroffer for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm determined to get the best deal possible. I'll reject again and try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Given our respective valuations, I believe a price of $750,000 would be fair.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $750,000. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000. While I'd prefer to pay less, this is a good deal for me. It's still significantly less than what I'd pay John, and it allows me to acquire the product with a healthy profit margin. I'm going to accept this offer."
