"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Given our respective valuations, I believe a price of $750,000 would be fair.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $750,000. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
