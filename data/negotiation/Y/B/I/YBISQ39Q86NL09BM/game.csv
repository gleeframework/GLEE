,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway - how about $10,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $9,800 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,150? This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,5,
