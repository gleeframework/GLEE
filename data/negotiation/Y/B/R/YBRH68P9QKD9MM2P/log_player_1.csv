This offer allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's offer, while still leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and how much he's willing to pay."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend closer to $800000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  I'm offering you $850000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is a good deal, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to counter with another offer closer to my desired price point.  We're getting close, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
