"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $8,000 minimum.  I'm also highlighting the value to Bob to make him consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I get the lowest amount I'm willing to sell for, and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection, which could lead to a lower price or selling to John for the same amount."
