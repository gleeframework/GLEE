"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $13,500 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still only able to offer $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential for a sale. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $10,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob."
