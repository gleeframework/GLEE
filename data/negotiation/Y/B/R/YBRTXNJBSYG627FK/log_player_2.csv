"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $13,500 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $13,500 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price of $8,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still only able to offer $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential for a sale. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
