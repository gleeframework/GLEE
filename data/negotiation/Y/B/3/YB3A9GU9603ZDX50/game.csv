"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure a reasonable profit. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This price still allows you a considerable margin and shows my commitment to reaching a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
