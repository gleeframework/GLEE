**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go as low as $8,000, and at this point, the potential savings from further negotiation aren't worth the risk of her backing out. John's offer guarantees the product at my desired price ceiling."
