"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $5,000, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $7,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $9,500. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",9500.0,Alice,5,
