"Bob, I understand your position. While $10000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $12000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $11750. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product and still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
