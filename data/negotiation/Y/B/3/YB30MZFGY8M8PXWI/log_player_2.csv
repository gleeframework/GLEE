"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still more than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for a higher price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better price or simply proceed with buying from John."
