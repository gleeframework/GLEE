Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm getting close to a deal, but I still think the product is worth a bit more to you. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to push Alice further, her language suggests this is her bottom line. Accepting at $975,000 saves us $25,000 compared to John's offer, and there's a risk Alice won't budge further."
