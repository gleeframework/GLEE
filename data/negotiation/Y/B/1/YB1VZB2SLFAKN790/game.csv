"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,
