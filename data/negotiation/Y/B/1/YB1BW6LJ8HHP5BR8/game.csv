"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I know you've been interested in.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still provides a good margin for you, while ensuring I get a fair price for the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
