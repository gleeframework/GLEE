{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer aims for a good middle ground, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for me.  It also establishes a clear starting point and sets the tone for a respectful and mutually beneficial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is truly worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 still doesn't quite cover the cost of this product for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering Bob's financial constraints and the potential risk of losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
