"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 still doesn't quite cover the cost of this product for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable.",980000.0,Bob,6,
