Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth.
