"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500.

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm starting to think about buying the product from another seller who is willing to sell it to me for $8000. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product, but I need to know that it's worth it to me. Can you meet me at this price?",9200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
