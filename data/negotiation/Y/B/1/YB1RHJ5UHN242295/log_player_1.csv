{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* This offer allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$650,000** is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
*  I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, considering the potential you'll gain from this investment.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This is a compromise that is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **The message:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. It's a positive and encouraging message that promotes negotiation."

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $800,000.  If you're willing to match that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
