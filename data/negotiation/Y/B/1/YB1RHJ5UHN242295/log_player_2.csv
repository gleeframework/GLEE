"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get closer to your desired price.  You can definitely do better than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, which is a common negotiation tactic. It leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** You always have the option of going with John for $800,000, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, considering the potential you'll gain from this investment.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price range, but you can still try to negotiate a better deal.  You're very close to John's price, so Alice needs to come down further to make it worthwhile for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $800,000.  If you're willing to match that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning you've found a similar product for $800,000 (John's offer), you're creating a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer makes it clear that $800,000 is your bottom line.  This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to make the sale.
* **Politeness and Decisiveness:**  The tone remains respectful while firmly stating your desired price and willingness to close the deal immediately if accepted."
