"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, given its value to you, and it's a very fair price for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not at that price. How about $1,000,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $950,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a significant reduction from your original price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
