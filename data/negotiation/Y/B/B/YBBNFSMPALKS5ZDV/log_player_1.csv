Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob thinking seriously about the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept that right away. Bob's offer is low, and I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing a willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This will hopefully encourage Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,250,000, taking $1,150,000 is a reasonable compromise that significantly outweighs selling to John for $1,000,000."
