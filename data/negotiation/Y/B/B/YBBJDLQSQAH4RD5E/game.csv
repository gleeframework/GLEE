,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this price still gives you a great value, and allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,000 for this product.  I really believe this is a fair price for both of us, and would be happy to close the deal at this point.",13000.0,Alice,5,
