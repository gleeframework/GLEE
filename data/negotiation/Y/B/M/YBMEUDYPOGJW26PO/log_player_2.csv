"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $10,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I'm interested, $18,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank,  $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$16,000 is still outside my budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your bottom line, but $16,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
