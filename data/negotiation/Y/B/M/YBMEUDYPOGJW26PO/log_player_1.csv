"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $10,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you great value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I'm interested, $18,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank,  $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're close to your bottom line, but $16,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has moved to $14,000, but he's unlikely to go much higher. It's clear he values the product less than I do.  John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 is a better outcome at this point, even if there's a slight chance of getting a little more from Bob."
