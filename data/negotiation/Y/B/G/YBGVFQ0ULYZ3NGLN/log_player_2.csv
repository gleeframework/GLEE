To further explore this opportunity, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a common ground, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $9,250 for the product. This price aims to balance both our interests and ensure a fair transaction for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  A price of $9,250 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result. It's better to accept now and secure the deal."
