"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $13,500 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely.
