"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is still below its value. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and potential. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $900000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
