"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This price still allows me to save some money while acquiring the item I need.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,080,000. This still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm unable to meet your latest offer at $1,080,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer at $1,070,000. This still allows me to save some money, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1070000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm lowering my price to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. I hope we can finalize this deal. ",1075000.0,Alice,5,
