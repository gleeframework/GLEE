Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, highlighting the potential for a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I anticipate Bob will counteroffer, so I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This price still allows me to save some money while acquiring the item I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:**  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  If the negotiation with Bob falls apart, I can still sell to John for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,080,000. This still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Strong Justification:**  I reinforce the value proposition for Bob while making it clear that I have a limit.
* **Clear Goal:** This counteroffer positions me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within a couple of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm unable to meet your latest offer at $1,080,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer at $1,070,000. This still allows me to save some money, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **One More Counteroffer:** I'm willing to give one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I can always sell to John for a higher price, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."

**Reasoning:**
