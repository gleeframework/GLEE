"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I need something closer to $900,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
