Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you would find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value ($15,000). This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$8,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for a price closer to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$10,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, and it seems Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
