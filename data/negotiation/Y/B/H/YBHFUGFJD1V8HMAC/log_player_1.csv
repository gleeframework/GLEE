Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to him, I'll aim for a price that's slightly above the minimum value I'm willing to accept, which is $1,000,000. Let's say I'll offer Bob a price of $1,500,000.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $1,000,000, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $1,000,000, but still lower than my initial offer of $1,500,000.

Let's say I'll offer Bob a price of $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 1200000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
