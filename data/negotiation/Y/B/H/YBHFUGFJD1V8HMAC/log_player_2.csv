Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price point that's a good compromise for both of us, while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and risking further negotiation as I could end up paying more or even lose the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether.  Buying from John at the same price doesn't offer any advantage."
