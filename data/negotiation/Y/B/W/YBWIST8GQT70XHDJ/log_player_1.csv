Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000. This price is still beneficial for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
