Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I'm explicitly mentioning the product's worth to him, highlighting the potential benefit he'd get from buying it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using positive language like ""Let me know what you think"" to encourage a conversation and avoid a hard ""take it or leave it"" stance. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to negotiate further.
* **Explore higher options:**  A counteroffer could potentially lead to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoid settling too early:**  Accepting Bob's offer might lead to regret later if I could have secured a better deal. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, perhaps $1,100,000, and continue to explore if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still maximizing my potential earnings.
* **Positive language:**  My message focuses on the benefit to Bob and uses phrases like ""great deal"" and ""fair profit"" to create a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Direct negotiation:** I'm proposing a concrete number ($1,100,000) to encourage a quick decision and move the negotiation forward.

By offering a counter-offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to work with him to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
