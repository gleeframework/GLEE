"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $10,000. Considering its unique features and benefits, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable compromise. 
* It's still a better price than John's offer of $10,000.
* Further negotiation might be possible, but the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
