Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, and I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. Could you do $12,500? It's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price without several more rounds of negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further hassle."
