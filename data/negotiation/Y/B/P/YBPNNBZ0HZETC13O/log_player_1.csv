Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
