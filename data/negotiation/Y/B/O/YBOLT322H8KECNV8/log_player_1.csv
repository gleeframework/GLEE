Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $10,000.  He's incrementally increasing his offers and seems stuck around the $9,500 - $9,750 range. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a potential gain of only $250, especially when you have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John."
