{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than what he can get from John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in Round 7 is the same as her initial offer in Round 1. It is clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate further.  Bob has only 3 rounds left, and there is a high chance that the negotiation will continue to stall.  Since Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it is now the best option to secure the product and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
