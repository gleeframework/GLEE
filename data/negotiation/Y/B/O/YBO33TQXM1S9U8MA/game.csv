"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately it's well beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product. It's the maximum I can offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $800000. How about we aim for a price of $1200000? I think it's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $900000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1100000? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $1100000 is getting closer, it's still a bit above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
