"Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  While I agree your product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000 to start the negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $8,000 is significantly below its true worth. Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a higher amount. Would you be willing to consider $15,000? This would be my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
