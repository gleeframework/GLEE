"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While $750,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to hold firm on a higher amount for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on reaching a deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? This recognizes the value you see while acknowledging the premium this product offers."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I can appreciate the need to recognize the value of the product, and I'm willing to stretch my budget. Would you consider $800,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now met his maximum valuation of the product.  While I could push for more, there's a risk he walks away or we waste valuable time in further negotiation. Accepting his offer secures a significant profit and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
