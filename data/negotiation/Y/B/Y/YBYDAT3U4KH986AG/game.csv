"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $10,500 is closer, I need to ensure a fair return on my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $10,750. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal!",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to be at $10,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. Can we finalize the deal at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to compromise one last time to reach a deal, but I need to stay at $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.  Let's end this on a positive note and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
