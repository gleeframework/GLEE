"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I really appreciate it. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $115 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $115 is getting closer, but I'm still at a loss at that price. I'm willing to come down to $120, but I really need to be at least at that price to make this worthwhile for me.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $118 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise given our previous negotiations.",118.0,Bob,6,
