"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for my budget right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some real willingness from you to make this work, and I appreciate that.  Let's try this: $16,000, and that's my final offer.  It's a fantastic price for what you're getting.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still above my budget. I can offer you $13,000. This is a fair offer, considering the alternatives I have.",13000.0,Bob,6,
