"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for my budget right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider something closer to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some real willingness from you to make this work, and I appreciate that.  Let's try this: $16,000, and that's my final offer.  It's a fantastic price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still above my budget. I can offer you $13,000. This is a fair offer, considering the alternatives I have. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to go above $13,000.  While we could try to negotiate him up slightly, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
