"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John.  Accepting the offer saves you $10 compared to John."
