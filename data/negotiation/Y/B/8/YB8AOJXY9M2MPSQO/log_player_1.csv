Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. It's a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to me and $80 to him. This gives us both room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm offering $120.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $120, $110 is still a decent profit, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from him.  There's always the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer, or me being stuck with a lower price than I want."
