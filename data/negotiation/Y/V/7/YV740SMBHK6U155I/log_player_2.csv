"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice's offer is already at $950,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Since you have 10 rounds, you can try to lower the price further. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While buying from John is an option, it's the least desirable outcome as it's the most expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum.  
* **Room for compromise:**  This leaves room for Alice to counter with a price that's still beneficial for both of us. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, so I'm not rushing into a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still far above my ideal price.
* **More negotiation needed.** There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** I want to exhaust all other options before resorting to paying the full $1,200,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between my previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still room for compromise:** There's still a $75,000 gap between my offer and Alice's, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **Strategic positioning:**  With 6 rounds left, I'm keeping the pressure on Alice while also demonstrating a willingness to reach a deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the offer slightly:** This shows Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal and am willing to budge.
* **Still within my budget:** This offer is significantly below my maximum price and leaves room for Alice to make a concession.
* **Building momentum:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high.**  While it's getting closer to my ideal price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay right now.
* **Time is running out, but I have room to negotiate.** With only 3 rounds left, I need to be strategic. However, I'm confident I can still get a better price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive yet realistic:** This offer is a significant increase from my previous offer, but still significantly below Alice's current offer. It shows a willingness to meet her halfway.
* **Time pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, I'm putting the pressure on Alice to make a decision. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'm likely to be forced to buy from John. However, I'm willing to take this risk in hopes of securing a better price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** This is the last round of negotiation with Alice.
* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's very close to my maximum, and I'm not confident I can get a better price in the remaining time.
* **Buying from John is the safest option:** While I prefer to pay less, buying from John ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice. 

I'm taking the guaranteed deal with John to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
