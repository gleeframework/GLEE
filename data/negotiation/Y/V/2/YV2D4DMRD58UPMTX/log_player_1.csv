Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest possible price within Bob's potential valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

By offering the product at $14,000, Alice positions herself to potentially gain an extra $2,000 compared to selling it to John. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance Alice can secure a price higher than her minimum."
