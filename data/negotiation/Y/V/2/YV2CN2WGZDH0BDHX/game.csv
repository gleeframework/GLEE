"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and to be fair, I could offer it to another buyer for a much higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
