Alice's offer:

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, you're still better off rejecting this offer. You can still get the same product from John for $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further or going with John."

You should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Alice, or simply go with John for a guaranteed lower price."
