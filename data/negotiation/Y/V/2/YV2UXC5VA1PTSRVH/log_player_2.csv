# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $700,000. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is only $50,000 above your previous offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you consider $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $815,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's $1,200,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks pushing Alice away entirely."
