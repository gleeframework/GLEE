Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $800,000.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $950,000, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly better than my minimum while still being attractive to Bob.  He'll likely be willing to pay a bit more than his ""next best alternative"" (which is not buying the product).

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
