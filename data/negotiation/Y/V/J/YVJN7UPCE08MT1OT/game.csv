"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it too.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, at $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,6,
