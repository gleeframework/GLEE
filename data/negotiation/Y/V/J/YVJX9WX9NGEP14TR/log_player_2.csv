"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by myself. Given its high quality and unique features, it's worth more than what you would find on the market. Considering its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your needs. Would you be interested in exploring this further? Let's aim for a price that makes sense for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
