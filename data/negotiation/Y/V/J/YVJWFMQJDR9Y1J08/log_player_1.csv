Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Above Bob's value:** $14,000 is still higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off.
* **Below your minimum:**  This is still above your minimum of $15,000, leaving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly opening:**  A friendly opening increases the chances of a positive negotiation. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation with a high price but leaves room to compromise if needed.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $13,500?  This seems like a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your proposal, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to go up to $13,200 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,200 is only $300 below my last counteroffer.  It's not my ideal price, but it's getting close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $15,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
