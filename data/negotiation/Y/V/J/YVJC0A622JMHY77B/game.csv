"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify spending that much.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part but feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000.  However, to show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000.  This represents a substantial concession on my part, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny for your business.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to work with me is appreciated. $850,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $750,000 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about we settle on $800,000? This price would give you a fantastic deal on the product and allow me to make a reasonable profit. It's a win-win situation! Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,7,
