"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
