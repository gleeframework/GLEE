"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to secure such a valuable item at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, you're aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your target price, you can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. How about $8,750? This feels like a fair compromise given our current positions."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In light of our ongoing discussion, I would like to offer you the product for $8,900. This is my final offer within the remaining rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While you can continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John for a higher price.  $8,900 is a good compromise and ensures you get the product at a price lower than John's offer."
