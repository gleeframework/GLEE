Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we don't want to scare him away with a price too close to that. Offering it at $1,100,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a strong fallback option with John at $800,000. This gives us leverage in negotiations with Bob.
* **Clear Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will receive, justifying the high price. 

**It's a balancing act:** We want to price high enough to maximize profit but not so high that Bob walks away. This offer attempts to find that sweet spot."
