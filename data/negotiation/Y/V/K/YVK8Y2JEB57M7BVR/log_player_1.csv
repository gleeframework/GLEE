"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a strategic move to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have 9 rounds left, and there's a good chance of getting closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is still significantly below the value this product holds for you. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your target. You have 6 rounds remaining, and there's a good chance of achieving a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable agreement. Selling to John at this point would result in a lower profit than potentially continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to reach a deal, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,090,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1090000}
