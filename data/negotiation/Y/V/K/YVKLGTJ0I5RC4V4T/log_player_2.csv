"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $150, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, but I need to make a profit. How about $110 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While $110 is closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $100 for the product? It would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $105 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Current Offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $105.
* **Comparison:** This price is still better than John's price of $150 and is within Bob's budget. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Alice might reject Bob's next counteroffer, potentially leading to a stalemate or forcing Bob to buy from John.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a good price.

**Conclusion:**  It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for $105."
