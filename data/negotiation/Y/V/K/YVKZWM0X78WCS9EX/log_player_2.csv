"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason: While $120 is lower than Alice's stated value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Direct:** The message is friendly but clearly states that the initial price is too high and proposes a significantly lower counteroffer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a way to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's completely unwilling to budge from near her asking price, moving to John might be the better option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $90 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to your $80 target than Alice's initial offer, and significantly less than her $120 starting point. 
* **Time Savings:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly better price, but there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Accepting now saves time and avoids the risk of her withdrawing the offer.
* **Value for Money:** While you could get the product for $10 less from John, the time and potential hassle of switching sellers might not be worth the small savings."
