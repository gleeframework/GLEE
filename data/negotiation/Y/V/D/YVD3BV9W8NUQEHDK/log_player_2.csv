"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that's significantly less than its value to you.  Let's make a deal that works for both of us.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,000,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still get the product from John for the same price you're willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
