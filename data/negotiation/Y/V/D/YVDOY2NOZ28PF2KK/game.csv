"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too far off from what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
