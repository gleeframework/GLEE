Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low for me. I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
