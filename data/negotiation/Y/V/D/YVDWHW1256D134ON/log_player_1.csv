""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially getting me even closer to $15,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still presents a potential saving for him if he values it more than that. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have the time to wait for Bob's response and am willing to risk him rejecting the offer. If I need to sell quickly, offering it directly to John for $15,000 is the safest approach."
