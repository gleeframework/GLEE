"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we try $1,080,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is cutting it too close. I've got another potential buyer lined up, but I believe you're the ideal fit for this product. To make this work, I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. Would you consider $1,110,000?",1110000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you have another buyer lined up, but I'm still interested in making this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
