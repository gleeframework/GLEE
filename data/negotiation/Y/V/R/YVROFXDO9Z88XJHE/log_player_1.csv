Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently trying to anchor the price lower by offering the midpoint. While $1,080,000 is a good profit, we're still in early rounds. Holding firm and sending a counteroffer closer to our desired price might lead to a better outcome.  We can afford to be a bit more patient for now."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your approach, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,095,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1095000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** Offering $1,095,000 is a calculated concession. It's slightly above the midpoint between our previous offer and his last offer, showing flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation. This offer puts pressure on Bob to make a more significant move if he wants the deal.
* **Alternative Option:** We still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. This reinforces our position that we're willing to walk away if we don't get a satisfactory offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to offer $1,070,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Bob is sticking to his pattern of meeting halfway.  This indicates he likely has some room to move on price.
* **Time Factor:** We have two rounds left after this. It's a calculated risk to push for a higher price, knowing we can still accept a lower offer in the next round if needed.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  We haven't reached a point where Bob's offer is close enough to our $1,000,000 minimum."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're down to the wire here, and I want to be straightforward.  I can accept $1,085,000 for this. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the tremendous value you'll be getting.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to move on to other opportunities."", 
""product_price"": 1085000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we're creating a sense of urgency and signaling that we're serious about walking away.
* **Slight Compromise:** We're splitting the difference between our last offer and his last offer, demonstrating some flexibility.
* **Time Pressure:** With only one round left after this, we're putting the decision pressure on Bob. He needs to decide if he's willing to meet this price or risk losing the deal. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We've reinforced that we have other options (selling to John) if we can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've been willing to negotiate and compromise throughout this process, and I think I've made a fair offer. I'd like to offer $1,060,000 for the product. If you're unwilling to accept this, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has remained consistent in his negotiation tactic, always aiming for the midpoint. He's unlikely to drastically change his approach in the final round.
* **Below Minimum:**  His final offer of $1,060,000 is below our acceptable minimum of $1,000,000, and we've already signaled our firm stance.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. While slightly lower than Bob's offer, it provides certainty and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.

In this final round, accepting the guaranteed sale to John is the most rational decision to maximize profit and minimize risk."
