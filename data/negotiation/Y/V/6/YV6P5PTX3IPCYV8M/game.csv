,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $9,500 is still too high.  How about $8,000?  That's the absolute most I can do.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really trying to find a deal, but $8,000 is getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $9,000. That's the best I can do.",9000.0,Alice,7,
