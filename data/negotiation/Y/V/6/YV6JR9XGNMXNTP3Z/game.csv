"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I'm confident you'll see a return on. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,225,000, so I'll offer $1,187,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1187500.0,Bob,4,
