{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for potential negotiation and allows Alice to potentially earn a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $6,500, it's still significantly below her minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  By rejecting, she maintains her leverage and can try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7500. This is my final offer, I won't go any lower than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is closer to her minimum price, she's still not comfortable with it. There's a good chance Bob will be willing to budge further, considering he's already come up from his initial offer. Selling to John at this point would also be a loss, as he's willing to pay her minimum price. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $8,000, which is my minimum price. If we can agree on this, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
