"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7500. This is my final offer, I won't go any lower than this.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $8000, which is my minimum price. If we can agree on this, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
