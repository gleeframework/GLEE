"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll really love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still be a good profit for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to get closer to my target price.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,,
