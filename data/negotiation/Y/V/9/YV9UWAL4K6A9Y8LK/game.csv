"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for someone with your interests and needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that range?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $1050000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I can offer you $900000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but that's the highest I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $980000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",980000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to reach your target price, Alice. However, I've already gone as high as I can go. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this offer. I'll consider buying the product from John for $1200000 instead.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
