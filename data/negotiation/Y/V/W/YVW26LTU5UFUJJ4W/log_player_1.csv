"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and can truly benefit your operations. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,250,000, you set a high anchor point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can make the offer more persuasive.

**Important Note:**  While I have 10 rounds to negotiate, my fallback option (selling to John for $1,500,000) is always in mind. I'll need to carefully assess Bob's responses in subsequent rounds to determine if I should adjust my price or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value ($1,000,000), it's still considerably lower than both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 

I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price and am willing to walk away if necessary. This strategy might encourage Bob to make a more competitive offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,200,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims to show a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.  It splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,200,000) and my previous asking price ($2,250,000).
* **Emphasizing Value:** I continue to reiterate the product's value to ensure Bob understands I'm not easily swayed by low offers. 
* **Time Constraint (7 Rounds Remaining):** While I have time, I need to guide the negotiation toward a favorable outcome quickly. This counteroffer keeps the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I value the product, $1,850,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. 

Accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of missing out on a sale that exceeds my baseline."
