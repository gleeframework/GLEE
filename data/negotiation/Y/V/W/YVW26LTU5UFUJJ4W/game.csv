"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,200,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I value the product, $1,850,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs. ",1550000.0,Bob,4,
