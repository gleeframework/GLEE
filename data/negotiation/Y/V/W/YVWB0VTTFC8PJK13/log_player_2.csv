"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price while keeping the deal alive. Offering $1,300,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering he is willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves him $150,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a chance he could get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
