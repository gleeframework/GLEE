"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him incentive to accept.  It also leaves some room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I still believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
