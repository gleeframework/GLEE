"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let me know if you're willing to move towards this figure.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I can offer you $900,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer! $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to be a little higher to make this work for me. How about $925,000? It's a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",925000.0,Alice,5,
