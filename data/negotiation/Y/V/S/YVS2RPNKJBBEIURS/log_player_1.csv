"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point and hopefully sparks Bob's interest. I'm not going to reveal my minimum value of $10,000 right away. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,500 is a good price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  It's getting closer to my initial asking price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
