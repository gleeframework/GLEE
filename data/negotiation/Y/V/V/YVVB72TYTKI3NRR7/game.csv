"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and $1,000,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I could consider letting it go for $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
