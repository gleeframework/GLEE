{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  To maximize your profit, you want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible. Offering a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage. Bob understands that if he rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while leaving you with a profit significantly higher than your guaranteed minimum."
