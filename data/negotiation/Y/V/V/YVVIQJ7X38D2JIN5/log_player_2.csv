"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product ($800,000), it's significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Saving money is the goal:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
