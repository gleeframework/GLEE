"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to work with you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a fair deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
