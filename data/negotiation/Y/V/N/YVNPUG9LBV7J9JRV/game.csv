"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm aiming for a price around $1,800,000, but I'm open to discussing what might work for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is truly unique. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would represent a significant but fair investment on your part.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value we both agree it holds. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
