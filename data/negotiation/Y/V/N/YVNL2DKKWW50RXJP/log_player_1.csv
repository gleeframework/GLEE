{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $105? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal profit margin. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about $108? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $108 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a sale and avoid the risk of him walking away or me having to settle for John's lower offer."
