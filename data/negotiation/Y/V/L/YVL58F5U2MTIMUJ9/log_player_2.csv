"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $100.  While this is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a little less. How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is still better than John's price, you're still within your budget and there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a lower price.  You're clearly willing to pay less than $105, so rejecting the offer is the best option to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I still think $95 is a bit low for the product's value. I can meet you in the middle at $100, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $105 to $100, which is a fair price for both of us. You're willing to pay up to $120, and this is a good deal considering you can always buy from John for $120. Accepting the offer saves you time and effort in further negotiation."
