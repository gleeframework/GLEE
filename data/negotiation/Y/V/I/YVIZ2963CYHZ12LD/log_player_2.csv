I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her own valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  You stand to save a significant amount by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
