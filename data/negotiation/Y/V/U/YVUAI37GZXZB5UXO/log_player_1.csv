"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above my minimum, it's not a good deal for me considering the initial high offer I made.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving a margin for profit. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is getting closer to what I want.  I've already gone through a few rounds and don't want to risk losing too much time. Accepting his offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
