Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation, giving me the flexibility to adjust based on Bob's response.  

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum of $12,000 as possible. If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on how close it is to my target. I'll also consider the time it takes to negotiate and whether it's more worthwhile to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  
* **While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.** 
* **I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who will pay my minimum price.**

**Strategy:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target of $12,000.
* I will try to get closer to my target price without risking losing the sale entirely. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I will carefully consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your business, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price closer to my desired price point of $12,000, but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise, aiming to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price, hoping to persuade Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm testing the waters to see if I can get closer to my minimum price.
* I'm trying to avoid a drawn-out negotiation that could lead to losing Bob as a buyer or delaying the sale to John.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll reassess my options based on how much time has passed and whether John is still available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Time Factor:** We've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and might not lead to a satisfactory outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price without any further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Prioritize Efficiency:** It's more efficient to sell to John now and secure the guaranteed profit.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks delaying the sale and potentially losing John as a buyer. 
* **Profit Maximization:**  While $12,000 is not my ideal price, it's the best outcome considering the current situation."
