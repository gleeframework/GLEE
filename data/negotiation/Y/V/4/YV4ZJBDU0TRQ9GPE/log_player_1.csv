Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and still ensures a significant profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and ""exclusive opportunity"", you create a sense of scarcity and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Target above Bob's valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $800,000, aiming higher allows you to potentially secure an even better deal.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your fallback option (selling to John) in mind."
