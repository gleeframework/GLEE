"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm serious about buying it, and this is my best offer.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal right now. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.  How about we settle on $10,900?  This would give you a good price and allow me to reach a reasonable selling point.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,900 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, and I think that's a fair compromise. It's just $100 more than my initial offer, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm confident this is a good price for both of us.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,850? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.",10850.0,Alice,7,
