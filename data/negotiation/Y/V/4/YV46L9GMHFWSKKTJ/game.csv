"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we value this product at $1200000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1100000 to you. Considering our initial offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1050000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you'll get from owning this asset.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
