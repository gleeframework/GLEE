Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible (the value John offers).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above $12,000. 
* **Maintain Attractiveness:**  While the price is high, it's not so exorbitant that Bob would immediately dismiss it. It leaves him room to consider the value proposition.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we are confident in John's guaranteed purchase at $15,000. 
* There is a risk Bob might reject the offer, leading us to sell to John at our minimum acceptable price."
