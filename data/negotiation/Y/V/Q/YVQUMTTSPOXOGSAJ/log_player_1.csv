"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe could significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While there's a risk he walks away, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Selling to John would be the ""safe"" option, but I'm aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my target.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification (""more accurate valuation"") adds weight to the counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and collaborative to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. Considering the value and the discussions we've had, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Holding out for more risks losing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  While I have more rounds, closing the deal sooner allows me to re-invest or utilize the profit more quickly."
