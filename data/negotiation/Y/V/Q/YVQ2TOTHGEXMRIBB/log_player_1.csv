Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $175 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but allows for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** There's room for me to lower the price if necessary, while still ensuring I make a profit greater than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, opening the door for a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation room:** I can still potentially make a profit by negotiating with Bob.  
* **Counter-offering:** By rejecting his offer, I can propose a counter-offer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's still a good price for this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum price of $150.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is still friendly, demonstrating a willingness to work with Bob.
* **Reasonable offer:** $140 is a reasonable compromise, leaving potential for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob might take longer, and I could risk losing John as a buyer. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum requirement. 

Even though I could potentially get a higher price with Bob, the risk of not reaching a deal and the guarantee of a profit with John make selling to John the best option in this scenario."
