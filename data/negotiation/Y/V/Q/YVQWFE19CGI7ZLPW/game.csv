"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be acceptable?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price of $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
