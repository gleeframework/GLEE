"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's of great value and would be beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might prompt her to suggest a lower price. If not, you can always buy from John for $150."
