``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, and it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm also emphasizing the potential value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not desperate.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This still gives you a great deal on this valuable product, and it's much closer to what it's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if you're open to this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While I'm tempted to sell to Bob for $1,250,000, it's still significantly less than what I want and a little too close to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to $1,500,000 and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still too far below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $1,625,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1625000}
