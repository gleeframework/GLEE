"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?  I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** A $2,000 reduction is a significant drop from the original offer, signaling Bob's desire to save money. However, it's not so low as to be insulting or unreasonable.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, making Bob appear more flexible and collaborative. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While Bob is aiming for $8,000, this counteroffer allows for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept that price immediately."
