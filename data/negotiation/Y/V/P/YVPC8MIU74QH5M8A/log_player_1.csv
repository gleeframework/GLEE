Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, you start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency (limited-time, other interested parties) might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation skills:** This strategy assumes you have limited information about Bob's negotiation tactics. If you knew he was a tough negotiator, you might adjust your starting price. 
* **Relationship building:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might offer a slightly lower, more ""fair"" price.

This initial offer is just the first step in a negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your price and strategy based on Bob's response."
