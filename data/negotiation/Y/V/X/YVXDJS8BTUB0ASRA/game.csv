"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
