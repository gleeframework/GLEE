,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $20,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. To be fair, could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still  above my budget.  Could you meet me closer to $12,000? I think that would be a fair deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal work. However, $12,000 is significantly below market value. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000. I'd much rather sell it to you, but I need you to meet me closer to that number. Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being transparent.  While $15,000 is a bit too steep for me, I understand the position you're in. I could stretch my budget to $12,500. That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,6,
