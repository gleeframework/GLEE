Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know is very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob is a subtle way to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, suggesting a willingness to compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a price closer to my desired $12,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation. It shows him I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500?  This would still leave you with a good deal, considering the value of this product for you. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, subtly reinforcing the reason for a higher price. 
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** My message continues to be open to further negotiation, suggesting a potential for a final agreement. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise point that benefits both parties and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $10,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $9,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,750 is still below my initial asking price, it's only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject this offer and counter again, there's a risk that Bob will get frustrated and walk away, leading me to the lower price of $8,000 from John.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate may not be worth the potential extra $250, especially considering the time and energy involved.

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer at $9,750 seems like the most rational decision, as it minimizes my potential loss and ensures a sale."
