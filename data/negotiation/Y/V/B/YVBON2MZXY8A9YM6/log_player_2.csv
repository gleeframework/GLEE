"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $14,000.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13000 is still a little low for me.  How about $13500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $14,000 offer, and $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's still within your budget of $15,000, and you're saving $500 compared to buying from John.  There's always a chance you could negotiate lower, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is high.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option."
