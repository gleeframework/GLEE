"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price. $110 is closer, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about $108?  That's a fair compromise, and it would help us both out.",108.0,Bob,4,
