"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price ($120), rejecting and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price. He knows the product is worth $100 to Alice, so he's offering $105, which is still a good deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's maximum price, he can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm on his previous offer of $105. He's confident that it's a fair price, and he's hoping that Alice will eventually agree. He's not ready to give up yet and wants to see if he can push for a lower price."
