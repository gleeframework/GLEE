Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

I'm still holding out for a better price. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,075,000 just isn't quite where I need to be.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I think $1050000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make a significant concession, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Let's try $1050000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price from Bob. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
