Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her latest offer is still above your target price of $800,000.  Further negotiation may be possible, but it's likely that you'll be stuck in a cycle of counteroffers with no guarantee of reaching an agreement. Buying from John at this point provides certainty and guarantees you get the product at a price within your budget."
