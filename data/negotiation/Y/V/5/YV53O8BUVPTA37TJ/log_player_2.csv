(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price point ($100 vs. $120 max).**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you ample opportunity to try and get a better price.

**Next steps:** You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm starting with a lower offer than Alice's price, aiming to get her to meet me in the middle.
* **Reasonable offer:** $85 is still a good profit for Alice (since it's above her valuation of $80) and is within your budget. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be, but I'm willing to go to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $91.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  I'm increasing my offer by only $1, showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but still trying to get the best price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. Let's try to close this deal.  I'm sticking to my offer of $91. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is where we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to your ground:**  You've already shown a willingness to compromise, but at this point, you're sticking with your offer of $91. This shows Alice that you're serious about reaching an agreement, but won't go any higher.
