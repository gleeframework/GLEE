"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss this product with you as I know it could be a great asset to you. To kick off negotiations, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair starting point considering its value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. That said, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I want to find a price we both find agreeable, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  $850,000 is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass at $850,000.  I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but any higher and I'm better off exploring other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
