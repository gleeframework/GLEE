"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price is closer to my budget and still represents a significant profit for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 is a substantial gap from my initial asking price. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to move forward. Let's work together to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
