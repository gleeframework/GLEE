"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,300,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** If negotiations fail, Bob can still secure the product from John, but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price is closer to my budget and still represents a significant profit for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 is a substantial gap from my initial asking price. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's ideal:** While closer, $1,150,000 is still outside of Bob's ideal price range. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has adjusted her price. There's likely room for further compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiations without committing to a price he's not entirely comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to move forward. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
