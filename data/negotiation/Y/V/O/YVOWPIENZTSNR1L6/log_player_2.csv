"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  Would you be interested in buying it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Saves you money:**  $110 is less than your $120 maximum and cheaper than buying from John. 
* **Gets you the product:** You achieve your goal of acquiring the product."
