"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $15,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is significantly lower.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a more agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $13500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's minimum value, it's still below her desired profit margin. She wants to try and get closer to her initial asking price, so she'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still quite a bit lower than my asking price. Let's try $14,250 as a compromise. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $14250 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $14000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is just slightly below Alice's minimum value of $15,000, but it's a good compromise considering the limited rounds left.  It's better to close the deal with Bob than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
