"Alice, while I see the value in your product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is still a good price given its potential.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This price would be a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
