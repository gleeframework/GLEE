Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make more than my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to take the $8,000 from Bob, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's offer, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's better to take John's offer of $8,000 and ensure I get my minimum price.  This ends the negotiation with Bob and guarantees a sale."
