"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I want to maximize my earnings, but I also want to avoid making an offer that's immediately rejected and pushes Bob away.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to counter, potentially meeting us in the middle.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's too early in the negotiation to accept. There are still 8 rounds left to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value the product offers you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm not willing to go as low as Bob's offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price.
* **Highlight the value:** I reiterate the value the product offers to Bob to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive and inviting tone:** The message remains friendly and invites further negotiation. 
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I've clearly stated my current position, giving Bob a clear idea of where I stand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I have enough rounds left to try and secure a higher price. It's still worth pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than $10,500, but I'm prepared to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):**  I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and collaborative approach.
* **Emphasize a final deal:**  By suggesting we finalize the deal, I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $11,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm aware that time is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $10,800. I think this is the highest I can go and still stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We have 4 rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  

I'm not ready to sell for $10,800. I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is still quite a bit below what I need. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a small compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price slightly, but I'm not willing to go too low.
* **Reiterate the value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get from the product to justify the price. 
* **Urgency:**  I subtly introduce a sense of urgency by suggesting we make this happen.
* **Remaining above the minimum:** The offer is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, but we are running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to offer $10,900. This is the highest I can go and still stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the wire with only two rounds left. Bob's offer of $10,900 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could try to counteroffer again, it's unlikely he will budge further.

Given the limited time remaining, I've decided to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's a better outcome than continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a much lower price from Bob."
