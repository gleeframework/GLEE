Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting significantly higher tests his willingness to negotiate and might reveal more information about his true valuation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling to Bob that this is not a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  You might be able to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will indicate how eager he is to buy and how much he values the product.

It's important to remember that you have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have the security of John's offer, giving you room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value remains high in the current market.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $1,700,000?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're showing flexibility by lowering your initial price, but not drastically. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** $1,700,000 keeps you well above both Bob's valuation and your guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely referencing ""market value"" adds weight to your position without revealing specific details about other offers.

This approach aims to:

* **Encourage Bob's Engagement:** The moderate price reduction might encourage Bob to counter with a higher offer. 
* **Maintain Profit Margin:**  You're still targeting a significant profit, leveraging your knowledge of John's offer."
