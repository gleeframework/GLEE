Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I'll consider my options. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send him a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but still lower than the product's true value to him. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $1,050,000.
