"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, it's still $250,000 less than what Bob would pay to John. This makes it the most financially beneficial option for Bob."
