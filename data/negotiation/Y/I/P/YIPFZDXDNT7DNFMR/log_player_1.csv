Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm.  Would you consider $750,000? This offer represents a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below what John is offering.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving us with a deal significantly lower than our secured alternative. It's time to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
