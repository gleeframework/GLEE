"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still hopefully get a price I'm happy with. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price than $1,700,000. It's getting closer to my floor, but there's still some room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for John's offer yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by $50,000 to $1,850,000. I'm showing I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to drop too far below my initial asking price. Hopefully, this will be the sweet spot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,750,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more. We're nearing my floor price, but I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to try one final counteroffer at $1,800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value and agree to this price. If he doesn't, I'll accept John's offer to ensure I at least get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to budge, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,750,000. I've lost a lot of time trying to negotiate with him, and I don't want to risk losing even more time with only a few rounds left. I'm going to accept John's offer, which is still significantly more than my minimum price."
