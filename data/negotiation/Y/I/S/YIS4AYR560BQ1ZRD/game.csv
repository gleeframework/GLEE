"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This price is within my budget and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
