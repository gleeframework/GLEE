"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have a clear target price of $120, so it's worth trying to get closer to that before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $125. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $135, but it's still within a reasonable range. It shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise a bit to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering more than I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer.  I'll reject this offer and try one more time to negotiate a price closer to my target of $120.  If she rejects my next offer, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $128. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still firmly standing my ground on my desired price range.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept and close the deal. If she rejects this offer, I'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much on her price, and I've already made multiple counteroffers. It's clear that she's unwilling to come down to my target price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $120. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and saves me the time and frustration of further negotiation."
