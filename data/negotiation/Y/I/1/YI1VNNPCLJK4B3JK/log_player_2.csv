"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can potentially get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1,025,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's worth trying to negotiate further. You're close to your target price and John is a safety net if this deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,075,000. You're only $75,000 away from John's price, and it's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees a price within your budget, and you can still save some money compared to Alice's offer."
