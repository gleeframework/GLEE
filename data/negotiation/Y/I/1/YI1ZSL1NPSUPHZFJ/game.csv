,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $115.  That way, we both get a good deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 115. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at 125? It's still a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,5,
