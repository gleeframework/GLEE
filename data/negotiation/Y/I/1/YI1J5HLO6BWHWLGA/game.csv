"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell it to you for $160. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $160 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. Could you consider offering the product for $140? Thank you for understanding.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - I can offer it to you for $155. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,5,
