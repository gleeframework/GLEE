Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth less than $18,000, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high. I'll offer $12,000 for the product.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $15000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.
