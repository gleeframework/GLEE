"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, I can get at least $80 from John, and I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value.  While $75 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $85.  This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
