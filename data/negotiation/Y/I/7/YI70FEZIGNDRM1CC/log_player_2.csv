{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet halfway.
