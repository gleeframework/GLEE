"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's in excellent condition and will be a great asset to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,500 is better than John's price of $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves me with a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price.  He should reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
