"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $11,500.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for you.  It's better than buying from John and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate much lower with Alice."
