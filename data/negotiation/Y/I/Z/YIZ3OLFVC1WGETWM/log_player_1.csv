"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me more leverage.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product has for Bob, even though it's lower than mine. This can make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message explicitly shows I'm open to negotiation, which could make Bob more likely to counter-offer instead of rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I can counter-offer and potentially find a compromise.
* **Keeping Options Open:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still a viable option, but it's too early to give up on negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it also reflects the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, demonstrating that I'm open to a deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving me some room to maneuver in future rounds.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm highlighting the discount from my initial offer and how it reflects Bob's perceived value, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet you at $900,000. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this would still result in a significant loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, there's still room to raise the price further. I can counter-offer and try to bridge the gap.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a viable option, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet. We're getting closer to a potential deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $850,000 still falls short of where I need to be. However, to show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've stated and the progress we've made. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I emphasize the ""significant compromise"" I'm making to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I reiterate the value Bob has stated, making my offer seem more reasonable in his eyes. 
* **Closing the Gap:** By meeting halfway, I'm demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet you at $875,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $825,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Upside:** There's not much room for further negotiation. Another counteroffer from me might lead to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a substantial profit and ensures I reach my minimum goal.  

It's a tough decision, but with time running out and a guaranteed high-value offer from John, it's the most sensible choice to maximize my earnings."
