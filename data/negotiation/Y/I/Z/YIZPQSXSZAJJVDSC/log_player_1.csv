"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this will give Bob a strong incentive to negotiate but also make him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my target of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, while still giving me a good profit. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I don't want to rush into a sale that doesn't get me a fair price, especially when I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  It's also close enough to his last offer that it might be attractive to him. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already rejected his previous offer and made a counteroffer. If I reject this one again, it might signal that I'm not serious about making a deal.  I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely.  

Furthermore, John is offering me the same price. Selling to John gives me a guaranteed sale, and I can avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a higher price."
