"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9500? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still a bit too low.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time at $9750. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay the maximum amount I'm willing to spend, which is $9000. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,8,
