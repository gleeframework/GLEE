"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. Considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. However, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already taking your budget into consideration. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for significant return.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is a fair price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,750,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the product's unique qualities and your initial asking price.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  To meet you halfway, my final offer is $1,825,000.  This is a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident it's one that will pay off in the long run.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
