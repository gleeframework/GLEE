# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your continued interest in our product. After careful consideration, we're willing to make another counteroffer. We're willing to meet you at $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from our original price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice walking away, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, minimizing risk and achieving Bob's goal of saving money."
