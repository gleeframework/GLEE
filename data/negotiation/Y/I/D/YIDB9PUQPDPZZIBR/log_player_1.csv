Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down considerably.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $125 is closer, but still a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and call it $110? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}"
