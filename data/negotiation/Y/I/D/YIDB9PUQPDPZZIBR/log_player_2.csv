"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $170. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way too high.  It's in my best interest to negotiate her down, especially since I have the option to buy from John for much less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down considerably.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a much lower offer ($80) than my actual budget ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that her initial price was unrealistic.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and shows interest, but clearly states that $170 is unacceptable.
* **Target in Mind:** My goal is to get the price as close to John's offer ($100) as possible, but I'm leaving some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $170 might have been a bit high, $80 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $125 is still too high. I know I can get it for $100 from John, and I'm willing to push the negotiation further to see if I can get closer to that price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $125 is closer, but still a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer to $95, showing willingness to compromise. This new price is right in between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""I'm ready to buy if you agree,"" I'm subtly adding a bit of pressure and indicating that this is a serious offer.
* **Close to the Limit:**  I'm getting very close to my walk-away point ($100).  If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, I'll likely go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and call it $110? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to push Alice further, $110 is only $10 more than my fallback option of buying from John.  At this point, the potential savings of another round of negotiation aren't worth the risk of her withdrawing the offer or me running out of time.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
