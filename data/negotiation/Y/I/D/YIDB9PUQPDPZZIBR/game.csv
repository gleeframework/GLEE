"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $170. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down considerably.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $170 might have been a bit high, $80 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $125 is closer, but still a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and call it $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
