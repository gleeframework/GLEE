"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount. $7,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering his $8,000 maximum and Alice's initial asking price. This allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room for Bob to potentially reach his ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a better deal. Accepting this offer ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
