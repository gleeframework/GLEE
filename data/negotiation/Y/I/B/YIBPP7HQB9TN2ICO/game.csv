"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product though, and I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $11500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
