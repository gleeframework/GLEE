"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
My reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down and still get a good deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $200, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher price. Even though Bob only values it at $120,  my initial high price might make his counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This opening offer leaves plenty of room for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and Bob's offer is significantly higher than his perceived value. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to $150.  Selling to John is my backup plan if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $200 might have been a bit high, but $140 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing flexibility by coming down in price. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Roughly):** While not exactly splitting the difference between our previous offers, I'm aiming for a price that seems reasonable and potentially agreeable to Bob.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm still above both Bob's valuation and my minimum acceptable price, aiming to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 matches both my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. There's no benefit to further negotiation or risking losing the sale. Accepting this offer secures the best possible outcome for me at this time."
