"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product at a price that reflects its value.  I'm asking $1,750,000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find the product's capabilities well worth the cost.  Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,250,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. Can you consider my offer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least at $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile.  This offer is still a significant discount from my original price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
