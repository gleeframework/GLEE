"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product at a price that reflects its value.  I'm asking $1,750,000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find the product's capabilities well worth the cost.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,250,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have several rounds left to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm confident I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least at $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile.  This offer is still a significant discount from my original price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's getting closer, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  We've made progress, and I believe I can get Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. With multiple rounds left, I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. There's a risk of running out of time and not reaching a satisfactory price. 
* **Small increments:** The price difference between my desired price and Bob's offer is small, making it unlikely we'll reach a significant compromise. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,500,000, which is my minimum desired amount. 

Even though I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
