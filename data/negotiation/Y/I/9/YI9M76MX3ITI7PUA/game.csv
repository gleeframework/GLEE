"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000 for your product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975000, which is a significant compromise from my initial price.  This price allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're willing to agree on this price.",975000.0,Alice,3,
