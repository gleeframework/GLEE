Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $10,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is close enough to my target price, and Alice seems firm on not going lower. It's better to accept this offer than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John for $15,000."
