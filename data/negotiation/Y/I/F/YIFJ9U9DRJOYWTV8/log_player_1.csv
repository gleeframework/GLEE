Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but finds the price slightly too high.
* **Above Bob's Perceived Value:** The offer is strategically above Bob's perceived value of $100. While this makes an immediate ""yes"" less likely, it sets the stage for potential negotiation towards a price favorable to Alice. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, Alice has a strong fallback option with John, ensuring she doesn't lose out on the minimum value of the product."
