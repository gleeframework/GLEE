"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while also trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $13,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,200 is close enough to my desired price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with only 6 rounds left.  It's better to secure a profit of $1,200 than to risk getting nothing at all if I fail to reach an agreement with Bob."
