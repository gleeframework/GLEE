"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but the value it brings to you is equally substantial. I'm confident you'll find it a wise choice.  Let me know your decision, and we can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is offering the product at the highest possible price. You can get the same product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
