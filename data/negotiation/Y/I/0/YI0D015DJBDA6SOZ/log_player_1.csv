"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and still allows me to get a fair price.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $800,000 is my minimum, and it's better than selling to John at the same price. I'm happy to close the deal."
