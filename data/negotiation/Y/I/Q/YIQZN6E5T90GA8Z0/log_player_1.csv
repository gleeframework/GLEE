Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $160. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 160
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting at $160 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($120) and still leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to subtly persuade Bob that the product is worth more than his initial valuation. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $160. You might have to negotiate or accept John's offer if Bob rejects your initial price."
