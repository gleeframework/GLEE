"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still a bit low, but I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still below what I believe this product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counter again, trying to get closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is getting closer, but I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk ending up with less than $1,000,000. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
