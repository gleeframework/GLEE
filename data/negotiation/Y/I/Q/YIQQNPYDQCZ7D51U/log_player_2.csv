"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $120 to him.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $95, which is still above Bob's ideal price.
* **John's Price:** $120, a fallback option but not the best outcome.

**Strategy:** Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to work with, and he can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Start by offering a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80. This shows a willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for further bargaining.
* **Reasoning:**  A $10 drop from Alice's initial offer is a significant move, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. However, it's not so low that it risks alienating Alice and causing her to abandon the negotiation altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $100, which is still higher than Bob's desired price.
* **Bob's Strategy:**  Continue to negotiate. Alice has already rejected a lower price, so Bob can push for a better deal.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, and John is still a fallback option.

**Reasoning:** While $100 is closer to Bob's price, it's still not ideal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Increase the counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows that Bob is willing to compromise but still wants a better deal.
* **Reasoning:**  The previous offer of $85 was rejected, so Bob needs to move closer to Alice's offer.  However, a $10 jump is a significant compromise, demonstrating his desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Next Steps:**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will need to decide how much further he's willing to go before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $105, which is still higher than Bob's desired price but closer to his willingness to pay.
* **Bob's Strategy:**  Continue negotiating. Although the offer is better, Bob has 5 rounds left and should try to get a better deal.
* **Reasoning:** There's still room for compromise. If Bob rejects, he can potentially get a lower price. However, he also needs to consider how much time and energy he wants to invest in this negotiation. If it drags on, it might be better to simply buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Meet Alice halfway. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially gets the negotiation closer to a conclusion.
* **Reasoning:** Alice has already rejected $90, so $95 is a reasonable middle ground.  Bob is still saving money compared to John's price.
* **Next Steps:**  If this offer is rejected, Bob will need to seriously consider buying from John. There are only 4 rounds left, and the negotiation may not lead to a better outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $110, which is still higher than Bob's preferred price.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Buy from John.  
* **Reasoning:** There are only three rounds remaining.  Alice has consistently been unwilling to meet Bob's price point.  Continuing to negotiate risks reaching the end of the rounds without a satisfactory deal. Buying from John guarantees the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget, although it's not the ideal outcome."
