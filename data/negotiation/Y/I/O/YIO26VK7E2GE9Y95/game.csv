,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is quite steep.  I'm interested, but I'd be much more comfortable at a price closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my position.  While $1,200,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
