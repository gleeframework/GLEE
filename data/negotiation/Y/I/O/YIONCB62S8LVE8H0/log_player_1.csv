I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least $12,000 (my minimum) if John buys it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$9,000 is far too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a compromise, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, $11,000 is a reasonable offer from Bob. It's above my minimum and a good deal considering the risk of continuing to negotiate."
