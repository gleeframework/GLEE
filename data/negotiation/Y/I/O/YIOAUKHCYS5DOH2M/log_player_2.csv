"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth that much to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to bluff you into paying more. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
