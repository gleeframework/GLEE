"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it would be a great asset to you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'm not willing to pay that much.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $9,500. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $10,750?  This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above my budget and I'm getting close to the limit of rounds.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with rather than risk further negotiations with Alice."
