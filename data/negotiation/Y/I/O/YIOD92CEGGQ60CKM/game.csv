"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it would be a great asset to you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $9,500. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $10,750?  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",10750.0,Alice,5,
