"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially get a better price than the $12,000 I can get from John. I'm also trying to build a rapport by highlighting the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $12,000. I have a backup option with John, and I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $8,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed offer from John for a much higher price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel like we're getting close to a reasonable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate the compromise.  However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 8000}
