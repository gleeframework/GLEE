"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better price."

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While it's lower than her first offer, he can still get the same product from John for $15,000. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

At this point, Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice has rejected multiple counteroffers, demonstrating a lack of willingness to negotiate down to a price Bob finds acceptable.  While Alice's offer of $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget than her previous offers, it's still higher than John's price.  It's more efficient to move forward with the guaranteed purchase from John."
