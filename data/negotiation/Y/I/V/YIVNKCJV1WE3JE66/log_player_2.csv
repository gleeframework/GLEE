"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob can save a significant amount of money by negotiating further.  It's unlikely Alice will immediately drop to Bob's target price, but a counteroffer will start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and is closer to Bob's target price. It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further negotiation without alienating Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob can still save a considerable amount by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows for more bargaining room and potentially reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm eager to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further compromise from Bob, but it still offers a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer. It's a strong position as it's the price Alice is willing to sell for. By highlighting the mutual benefit, Bob hopes to encourage Alice to accept this offer."
