# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
