"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity tailored to meet your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny. I am offering this remarkable product to you for $9,500. This price reflects not only the product's quality but also the unique benefits and services we provide with it. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and contribute significantly to your endeavors. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is only slightly better than your alternative option of buying from John for $10,000.  By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counter-offer from Alice at a potentially lower price. It's a calculated risk, but since the difference isn't huge, it's worth seeing if you can secure a better deal."
