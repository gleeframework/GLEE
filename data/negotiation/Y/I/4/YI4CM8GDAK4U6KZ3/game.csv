"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can find a price closer to the product's true value to both of us. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still leaves plenty of room for a profit for you, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'll consider it, but I would like to propose $9,500 as a potential price for the product. I hope this aligns better with our mutual interests.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that gives you a substantial profit while also allowing me to get a good return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
