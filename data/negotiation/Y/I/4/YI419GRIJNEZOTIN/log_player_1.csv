Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my initial target. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to an agreement."
