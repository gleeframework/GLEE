You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to stick to your budget, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $85. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer lined up. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $85 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $80.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. There's no point in further negotiation with Alice if you are unwilling to exceed your budget."
