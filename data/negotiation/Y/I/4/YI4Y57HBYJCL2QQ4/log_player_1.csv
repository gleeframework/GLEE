{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but still below my minimum ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being too aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

This offer balances the need to maximize profit with the potential for a successful deal. If Bob rejects, I can always go back down to $120 or offer a counteroffer, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. It's better to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, or even sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob don't progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price. $90 is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, encouraging Bob to keep negotiating.
* **Focus on Finding Middle Ground:** I'm emphasizing the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, making it clear that I'm open to a compromise. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation going while still protecting my interests. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still consider selling to John or making another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget.  Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, $75 is still too low.  I'm not comfortable selling at such a significant loss, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $120.  

Rejecting this offer allows me to either:

* **Counter-offer again:** I can try to bridge the gap by offering a price slightly higher than $75, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **Sell to John:** If I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob, I can sell to John for $120, ensuring a profit and avoiding further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to stick to your budget, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $85. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer lined up. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to take the deal.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($90) and his latest offer ($75).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning another buyer highlights the potential loss for Bob if he rejects this offer.

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal close to my minimum price while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $120, ensuring a profit."
