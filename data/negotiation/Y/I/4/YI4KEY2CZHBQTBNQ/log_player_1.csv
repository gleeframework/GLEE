Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can then consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'd like to get the highest price possible, selling to John for $15,000 is still a good outcome.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is higher than what John is offering, and it's also very close to my minimum value.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
