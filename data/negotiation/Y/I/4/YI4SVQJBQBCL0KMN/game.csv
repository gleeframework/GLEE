"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750? It's a good compromise, and we can close the deal quickly.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This price allows for a fair profit for me while remaining within your budget. Let's try to finalize this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
