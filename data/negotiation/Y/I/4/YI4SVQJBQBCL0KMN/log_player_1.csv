"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $9,500.  I'm also keeping in mind the 10-round limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750? It's a good compromise, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm only two rounds away from the minimum price I'd accept from John, so there's no urgency to settle now. I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This price allows for a fair profit for me while remaining within your budget. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
