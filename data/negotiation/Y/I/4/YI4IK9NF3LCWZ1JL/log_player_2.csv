"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting the significant value this product holds. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,350,000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing us both to achieve our goals.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It appears negotiations are getting stuck, and further counteroffers may not lead to a price Bob is willing to accept. Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,200,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid potentially wasting more time negotiating."
