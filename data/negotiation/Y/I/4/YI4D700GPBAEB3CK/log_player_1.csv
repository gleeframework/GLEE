Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While Bob's offer is lower than I hoped, it's still significantly more than my minimum. I'll accept.
