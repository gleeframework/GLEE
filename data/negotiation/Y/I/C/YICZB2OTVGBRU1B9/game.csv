"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $11,250 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. ",12000.0,Alice,5,
