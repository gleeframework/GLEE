Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows you to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, providing a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

By offering the product at $9,000, you strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
