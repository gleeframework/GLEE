"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While you value the product at $10,000, Alice is offering it for $9,000. This means you can save $1,000 by accepting her offer.
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you're getting it for $9,000. You're paying more than she values it, but still less than what you're willing to pay."
