"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, you're trying to save money, and $15,000 is above your maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business and the value it will add to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still outside my price range. I'm confident that $12,000 is a fair and reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. I'm happy to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
