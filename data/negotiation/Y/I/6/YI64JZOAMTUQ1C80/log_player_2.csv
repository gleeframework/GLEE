"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

Bob is willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still within his budget and leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the price is getting closer to his maximum, and there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer, leading him to have to buy from John at a much higher price.  $9,500 is a good deal for Bob, saving him $2,500 compared to buying from John."
