Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum value."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value of $1,200,000 just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum,  I'm still not willing to accept an offer below $1,200,000. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm getting close to just selling to John."
