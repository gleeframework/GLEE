"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you value at $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my own need to maximize my earnings. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
