"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more than you realize. I'm willing to offer it to you at a starting price of $1,800,000. I think it's a fair starting point considering the potential benefits you'll reap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum valuation. You should definitely reject and counter-propose a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I'm willing to offer $500,000."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below Alice's asking price but well within your budget. This leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Direct & Honest:** The message is clear that the initial offer is unacceptable and provides a concrete counter-proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $500,000 is simply not a realistic valuation for this product and its potential. I'm prepared to meet you halfway between our offers. How about we consider $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,150,000 is still way above your $800,000 maximum. It's important to show you're serious about a lower price point and not willing to settle near her initial offers. We'll continue negotiating but be prepared to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's as high as I can go right now."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're raising our offer, but not drastically. This shows willingness to negotiate while reinforcing our budget constraints. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The message aims to be respectful of Alice's position but firm in our limitations. 
* **Time Consideration:** With each round, the option to buy from John becomes more appealing. We need to nudge Alice closer to a reasonable price quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving up on the price, but we're still significantly apart. To be honest, I have another offer on the table for $1,200,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need you to be closer to that figure for this to make sense. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one. Alice is claiming to have another offer at her valuation, which adds pressure. However, $1,050,000 is still too high, and her ""final offer"" tactic could be a bluff.  We'll reject and offer a price much closer to John's, making it clear we're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront with you. My budget for this product is capped, and to be honest, I've already secured an alternative option at a significantly lower price. I can offer you $750,000, but I need you to understand that this is my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** We're being transparent about having another option (John's deal) without explicitly mentioning him. This creates a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By mirroring Alice's ""final offer"" language, we signal strong resolve and emphasize the attractiveness of our offer within your budget limits.
* **Potential Walk-Away:** We haven't fully committed to John's deal yet, but Alice needs to understand you're serious about walking away if she doesn't budge."
