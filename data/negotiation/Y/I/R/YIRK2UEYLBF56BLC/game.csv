"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I understand you may not know its full potential, so I'm willing to let you assess it. My asking price is $1500000. This is a price point that reflects the value I see in this product, but I'm confident it could be worth considerably more to the right buyer.  If you're interested, I'd be happy to discuss it further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000. The decision is yours.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
