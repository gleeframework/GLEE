"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and he has the option to buy from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum budget of $10,000 as possible. By offering $9,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying but is still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still being a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,700 is only $200 more than Bob's counteroffer and is closer to his budget than buying from John for $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching an impasse and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for saving a few hundred dollars."
