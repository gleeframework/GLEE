"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, claiming you value it at $1,500,000 when you've set a maximum budget.
* She's also using a pressure tactic by mentioning another buyer.
* While you'll have to pay John a bit more ($1,500,000), it's still better than overpaying Alice by $100,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you call her bluff and leave yourself in a position to get a fairer price from John."
