"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That still leaves a good profit margin for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
