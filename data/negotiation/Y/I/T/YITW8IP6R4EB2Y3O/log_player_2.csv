"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice.  You can offer a lower price and see if she's willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That still leaves a good profit margin for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a good price for you. You're still saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee you can get a better price from Alice in the next round."
