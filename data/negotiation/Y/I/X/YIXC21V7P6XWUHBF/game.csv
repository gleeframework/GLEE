"Alice, that initial offer is quite high. This product is good, but not $2,250,000 good. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start this negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the immense value it offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I believe this product has value, your current offer doesn't align with my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a realistic price point. However, we're still quite a ways apart. To find a compromise, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,650,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but your price is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my limit.  If this doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
