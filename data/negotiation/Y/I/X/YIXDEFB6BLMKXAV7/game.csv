"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially worth far more than my minimum asking price. To kick things off, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential value this product offers, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, I'm also confident in the value this product brings. Could you consider $1,050,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $975,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle this right now: $1,012,500.  That's halfway between our last two offers.  Do we have a deal?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $1,012,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",990000.0,Bob,6,
