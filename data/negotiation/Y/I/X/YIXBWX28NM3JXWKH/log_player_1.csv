Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum value. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit for Bob with ""great deal"", and the ""good price"" for me suggests I'm open to compromise.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not offering the absolute minimum, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic. 
* **Preparing for John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $10,000, but I'm aiming to get closer to that amount with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price. This keeps the negotiation alive and potentially leads to a better outcome. 
* **John as a safety net:** If further negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""mutual benefit,"" making the counteroffer seem more attractive.
* **Keeping the door open:** I'm not closing the deal completely with this counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation if needed.
* **Still above minimum:** $9,000 remains above my minimum $10,000 value, ensuring I don't lose out in the worst-case scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  While it's closer to my budget, I'm still only able to go up to $8,750. This is a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $8,750 is closer to my minimum value than before, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk further rounds of counteroffers, potentially lowering the price even further.
* **Secure deal with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a better deal with John.

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I meet my minimum target price and avoid further potential losses in the negotiation."
