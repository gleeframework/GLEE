Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $20,000 is too steep. I'm thinking of offering $14,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm eager to find a deal, $14,000 is below what I can accept.  Would you consider $17,000?  That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $17,000. How about $15,500?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
