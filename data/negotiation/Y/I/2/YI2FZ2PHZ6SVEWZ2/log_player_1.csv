Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you invite a counter-offer and signal a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving room to reach an agreement that surpasses your guaranteed sale to John."
