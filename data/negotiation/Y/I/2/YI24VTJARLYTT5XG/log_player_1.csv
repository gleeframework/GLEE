Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
