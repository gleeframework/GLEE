"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This still gives us both a good deal, and allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is simply not enough for me to cover my costs. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $11,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
