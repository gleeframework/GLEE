Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

I've been through several rounds with Bob, and while I've tried to find a compromise, he's consistently offering below my minimum price point. At this point, it's becoming clear that we won't reach an agreement, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk getting nothing from Bob."
