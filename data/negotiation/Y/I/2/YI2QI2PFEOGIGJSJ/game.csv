"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the potential value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer represents a fair price that acknowledges the product's benefits while working within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your perspective.  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider right now.  How about we split the difference at $1,100,000? This price still offers you a significant value proposition and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
