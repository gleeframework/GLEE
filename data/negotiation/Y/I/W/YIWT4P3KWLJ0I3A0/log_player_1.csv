Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I believe it's highly valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
