"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to make a counteroffer and see if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,500 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about getting a better deal but isn't being overly aggressive.
* **Within budget:** $12,500 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Fair to Alice:**  While this price is lower than Alice's desired price, it's still above her minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  

This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement within Bob's budget and Alice's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $13,500 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price and closer to his desired price range.
* **Limited time:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, it's risky to keep rejecting offers and potentially run out of time. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob might end up having to pay John's higher price.
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitless. 

While Bob could potentially push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to pay John outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
