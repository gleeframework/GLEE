Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price."
