Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. Given its worth, I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you an idea of his willingness to pay. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can then negotiate down towards your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines."
