"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable.  I believe it's worth $100 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't let it go for less than $80.  How about we split the difference and you get it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
