Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to me. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to explore if there's any wiggle room in Bob's valuation.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but ultimately, I have a fallback option with John to guarantee a minimum of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can push for a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  If he accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my target and the negotiations seem to be stalled. There's a risk of further counteroffers and delays, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price and secures the deal."
