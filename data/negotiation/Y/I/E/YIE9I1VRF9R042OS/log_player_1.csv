Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  The price is about halfway between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a little lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $12,500, Bob seems firm at $12,250.  This is still a good price for me, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000. Let's accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
