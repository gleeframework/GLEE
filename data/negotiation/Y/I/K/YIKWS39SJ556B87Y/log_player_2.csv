"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense."
