Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind a strong opening offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This represents his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Your Walk-Away Point:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. This is your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Opportunity for Profit:**  The difference between Bob's value and your walk-away point is the potential profit zone.

**The Strategy: Aim High, But Be Realistic**

While you could start with an outrageously high price, it might immediately turn Bob off and make him less receptive to negotiation.  Instead, we want to anchor our price high but within a believable range.

**Here's my suggested offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confident Opening:** The message projects confidence in the product's value.
* **Strong Price Point:**  $950,000 is a significant markup from your minimum, but not so high that it seems entirely out of reach for Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""exceptional returns"" subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Negotiation is a back-and-forth process. Having John's offer as a safety net means you have strong leverage to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet a price that works for you."
