"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a significant discount from my maximum budget of $1500000, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900000 is still quite low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
