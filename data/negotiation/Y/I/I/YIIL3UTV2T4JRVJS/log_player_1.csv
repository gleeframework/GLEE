``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation. I'm offering the product for more than its value to me, but less than its value to Bob. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still allowing room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low. Considering the value of this product for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's work towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept as it's closer to my target, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to close the gap."
