Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I think $140 is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $150. Offering it slightly below his valuation maximizes the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $140, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate down. Starting higher provides some buffer room while still staying above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it too high (close to $150) risks Bob rejecting the offer, leading Alice to sell it to John for only $100. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between profit maximization and the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
