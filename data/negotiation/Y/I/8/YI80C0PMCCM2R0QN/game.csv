"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $125. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80. If you're willing to come down to $90, I'd be happy to make a deal.  ",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $110. It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still above my budget. I'm ready to pay $95, which is a fair price considering your last offer. Let's see if we can agree on this.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $110 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.
