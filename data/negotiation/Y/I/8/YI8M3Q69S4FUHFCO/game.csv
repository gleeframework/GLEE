"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $10,750 is a tempting offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my bottom line. How about we agree on $10,900?  That's a significant compromise on my part and reflects my desire to make this deal happen.",10900.0,Alice,5,
