"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and this is a chance to acquire a valuable asset. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, there's no harm in seeing if you can get it for a lower price from her. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price, especially since she mentions selling it to another buyer for the same amount."
