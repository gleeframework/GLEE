"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure about $85. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price?,75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $80. I'm still thinking $75 is a fair price. Can you consider that?",75.0,Bob,6,
