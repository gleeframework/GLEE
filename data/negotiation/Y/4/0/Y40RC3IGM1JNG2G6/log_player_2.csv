"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stay closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to offer the product for $910,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.
