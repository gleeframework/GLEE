"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10500? That's still a great deal for you, and closer to my minimum. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
