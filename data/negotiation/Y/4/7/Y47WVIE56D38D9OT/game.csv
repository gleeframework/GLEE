"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $10,750 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we settle at $9,750? ",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
