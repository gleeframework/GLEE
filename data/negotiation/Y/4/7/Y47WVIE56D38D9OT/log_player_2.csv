Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she is unlikely to reach your target price of $10,000.  She has stated $10,500 is the lowest she'll go. It's time to cut your losses and secure the known good deal with John."
