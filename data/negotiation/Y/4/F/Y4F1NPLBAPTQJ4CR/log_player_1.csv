"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation while anchoring the price high in Bob's mind. 
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason (""true value"") makes the price seem less arbitrary and more tied to the product's worth.
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't mentioned John directly, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more firm in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, but still significantly below my minimum.  Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to gauge his willingness to move closer to my desired price range. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,500,000, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by making a significant move from my initial price.
* **High Target:** I'm still aiming high at $1,750,000, well above both his offer and my minimum. This leaves room for further negotiation while pushing for a higher final price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, but I still believe there is room for negotiation. My counteroffer would be $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,600,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a serious interest in the product. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially stalling or Bob reducing his offer. While I could potentially extract more from Bob, it's not worth the risk of losing the $1,100,000 profit."
