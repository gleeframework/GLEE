Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,000, I can get at least $10,000 from John. There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I might be able to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still leaves some room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. This price reflects the value I place on the item and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered the minimum I am willing to sell for, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum desired price."
