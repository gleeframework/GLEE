"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget ($10,000).
* I want to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* I have 10 rounds to make a deal, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. 
* I'm trying to create a gap between our expectations that will encourage negotiation.
* I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, hoping to convince Alice to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still leaves some room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I still want to try and get a better price.
* $10,500 is still above my maximum value, and I have several rounds left to negotiate.
*  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. This price reflects the value I place on the item and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering my maximum price, making it clear that this is my final offer.
* I'm emphasizing the fairness of the deal, highlighting that it meets both of our needs.
*  I'm hoping to close the deal in this round, as I'm already at my budget limit."
