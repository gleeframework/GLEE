You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's way over his budget, and he has better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is going to start with his absolute maximum price. This is a bold move, but it sets the tone for negotiation and shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above his ideal price. He's got room to negotiate further and shouldn't settle until he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly. This shows that he's willing to compromise, but still  trying to get a better price than $10,000. He's also keeping in mind that he can always go to John if the deal falls through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's only $500 over his ideal price of $9,000 and it's likely he won't get a better deal, especially with the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer. It's also possible that Alice may change her mind and raise the price again.  It's time to strike while the iron is hot and get the deal done."
