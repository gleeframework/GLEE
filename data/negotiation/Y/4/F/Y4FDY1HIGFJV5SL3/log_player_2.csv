"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. Let's aim for a fair deal. How about we start at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $95 is lower than the product's worth to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a lower price. 
* **Jhon's offer is a safety net:** You have the option to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a suboptimal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. While $95 is a good starting point, my budget is a bit tighter. I'm willing to offer $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $10 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant step but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Establishing a negotiation range:** This counteroffer clearly defines your willingness to pay, setting a range for potential compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You've shown a willingness to negotiate, but not to the point of accepting a price that's too high for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your response, Bob. I'd like to counter your offer with $90 for the product. This still allows us to find a fair compromise while respecting both of our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget:**  While it's closer to your desired price, $90 is still outside your $100 limit. 
* **Opportunity to continue negotiation:** You have more rounds available and can continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price.
* **Jhon's offer is a safety net:** You're still covered by Jhon's offer if negotiations fail, so you don't need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. $90 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go to $88 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  I think this allows us to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:** Increasing your offer by $3 demonstrates your willingness to compromise, but it's still within your budget.
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  The message highlights the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Alice to consider meeting you halfway.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By staying firm on your budget, you're putting pressure on Alice to come down in price to avoid losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to counter with $89 for the product. This keeps the deal fair while moving closer to each other's positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $89 is below your maximum of $100, making it a financially viable option.
* **Close to your counteroffer:** Alice's offer is only $1 higher than your last counteroffer, indicating a willingness to meet you halfway. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the chance of getting a significantly lower price is diminishing, and you risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Jhon's offer is no longer the best option:**  Buying from John would cost you $1 more than Alice's offer. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it provides a good deal within your budget and minimizes the risk of missing out on a purchase."
