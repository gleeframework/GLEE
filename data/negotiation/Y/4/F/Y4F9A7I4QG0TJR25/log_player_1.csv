"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm aware that Bob values the product at $10,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to lower my price in subsequent rounds if needed, but I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is better than Bob's initial value of $10,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe $16,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired value.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. I'm also starting to consider the option of selling to John, as time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, but I'm also feeling the pressure of time. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Time is running out, and I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from Bob.  Although I would prefer to get closer to my desired value, it's better to secure a sale than risk getting nothing at all. I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
