"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $19000?  Let me know what you think.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $17500? That's the lowest I can go.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. While I'm happy to negotiate, $17500 is a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $18500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $18500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $17000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means.",17000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground.  I'm still not comfortable with $17000.  My final offer is $18000.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on.  ",18000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to budge much further, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between our last two offers? That would be $17500.",17500.0,Bob,8,
