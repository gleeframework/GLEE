Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really useful. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $65. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $65, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind.  How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is still offering too low.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum goal, I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $85? I've already lowered my price significantly, and this is really the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 85}
