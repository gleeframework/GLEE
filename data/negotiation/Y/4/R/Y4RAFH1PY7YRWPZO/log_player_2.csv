"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $85? I've already lowered my price significantly, and this is really the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's tempting to try and negotiate further, but Alice has come down in price considerably and seems firm at $85. You can get the product for your target price of $80 from John, so it makes the most sense to take that guaranteed deal."
