Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer. He might be willing to pay slightly more than $8,000, especially if he believes it's a good deal. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $10,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer outright.  It's better to secure a slightly lower profit now than risk losing the sale altogether. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down a little, but shouldn't go below $10,000 as she has a guaranteed buyer at that price."
