"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $95? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $95 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's make this deal happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
