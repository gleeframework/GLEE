"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $130. This is a great deal, as I'm usually selling it for much higher. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  Your goal is to save money, so buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
