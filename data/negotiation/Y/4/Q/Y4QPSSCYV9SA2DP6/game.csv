"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also want to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is the price John is offering.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint of our previous offers, which is $1,650,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. If not, I'll have to sell to John.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
