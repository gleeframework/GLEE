"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference at $120. That's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of this product.  This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
