"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford at this time.  How about we settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $12,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Alice,5,
