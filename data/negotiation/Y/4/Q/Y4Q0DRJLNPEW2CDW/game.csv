"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it priced closer to $15000.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $17500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
