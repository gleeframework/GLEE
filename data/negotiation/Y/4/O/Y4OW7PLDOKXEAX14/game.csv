"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still within the range of value for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,225,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and represents a significant reduction from your previous offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
