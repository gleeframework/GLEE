Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $19,000. I'm willing to go up to $18,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting the $18,500 offer is a better outcome than risking a lower offer or being forced to sell to John for $15,000."
