"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify spending $10,000 on it at this time. I would like to propose an offer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I'm still hesitant to spend $9,500 on it. I would like to propose an offer of $9,000 again, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,4,
