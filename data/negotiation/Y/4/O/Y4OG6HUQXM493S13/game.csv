"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about $82.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product!",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $78.  I'm really interested in this product, so let's see if we can find a price we both feel good about.",78.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I'm not willing to go any lower. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
