"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **$180 is too high:**  The product is worth $120 to you, so Alice's initial offer is way above your limit.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Rejecting allows you to start a counter-offer process, potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows interest:** It acknowledges Alice's offer, indicating you're willing to negotiate.
* **Starts low:**  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within your budget.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  It provides an opening for Alice to counter without going too far below your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming up, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to your limit, it's still a bit high. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $160 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
