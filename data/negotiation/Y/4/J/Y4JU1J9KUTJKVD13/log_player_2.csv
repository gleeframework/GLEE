Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500. How about $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer."
