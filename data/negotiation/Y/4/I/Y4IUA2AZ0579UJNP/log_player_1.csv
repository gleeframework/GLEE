Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that price point. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a more reasonable price for the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Reasoning: Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and $9,500 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer further or walking away."
