``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You'd save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **While the product might be worth $1,500,000 to you, that's your maximum willingness to pay, not necessarily the actual value.**  You're aiming to save money, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice."
