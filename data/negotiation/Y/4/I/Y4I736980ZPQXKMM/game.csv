"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about $9500?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $9250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product!",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm starting to think about buying from John for $12000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
