,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your desire to maintain a profit, I believe we could find common ground.
