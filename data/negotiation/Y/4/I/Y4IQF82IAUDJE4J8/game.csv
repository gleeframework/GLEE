"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John for $100 if we can't come to an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $115 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $125.  This is a fair compromise and  gives you a good deal on the product. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. My final offer is $120. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with John's offer of $100.",120.0,Bob,6,
