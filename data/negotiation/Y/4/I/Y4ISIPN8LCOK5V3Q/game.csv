"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your initial thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it still allows you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This allows me to still make a fair profit while offering you a significant discount compared to my initial asking price.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
