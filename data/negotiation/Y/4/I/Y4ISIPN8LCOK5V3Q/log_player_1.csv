Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it still allows you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,375,000?
