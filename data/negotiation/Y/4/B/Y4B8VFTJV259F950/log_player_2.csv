"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above my absolute maximum. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is a little low for me right now, I could come down to $17,000.  I think that's very fair considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $17,000 is still too high. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it below my absolute maximum.  I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about buying the product and will be willing to come down a bit more."
