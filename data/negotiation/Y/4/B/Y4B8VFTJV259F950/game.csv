"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is a little low for me right now, I could come down to $17,000.  I think that's very fair considering the value you'll be getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
