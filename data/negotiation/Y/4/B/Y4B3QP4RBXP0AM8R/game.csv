"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,200,000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This represents a fair compromise and would allow us both to benefit from this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
