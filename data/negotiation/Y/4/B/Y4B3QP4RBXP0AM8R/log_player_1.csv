Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,200,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,200,000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This represents a fair compromise and would allow us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price range, it's unlikely he'll reach it within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
