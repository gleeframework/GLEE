Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description]. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, allowing for room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It also provides some information about the product to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your [product description], but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is the minimum price you're willing to accept.  While it would be great to get more, there's no guarantee of a better offer and you risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer secures a sale and prevents potential delays or complications."
