Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth more to Bob ($1,500,000) than it is to me ($1,000,000), aiming high initially allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and gives me insight into his negotiation strategy. 
* **Backup plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers aren't favorable, I can always walk away and still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but I think that price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) and my initial offer. There's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's further away from what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,225,000?"", ""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but with a bias):**  Splitting the difference between Bob's offer ($1,100,000) and my previous offer ($1,350,000) shows a willingness to negotiate. However, the midpoint still leans closer to my initial price, aiming for a better outcome. 
* **Clear communication:**  By stating that his offer was ""further away from what I had in mind,"" I'm subtly letting Bob know that he needs to make a more significant move to reach a deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I haven't revealed my minimum price or shown desperation, keeping the power dynamic in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I have a budget in mind. Could we make it $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small incremental increases, and there's a risk that Bob could walk away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner rather than later, which is always advantageous. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob prevents me from exploring other potential buyers who might be willing to pay even more."
