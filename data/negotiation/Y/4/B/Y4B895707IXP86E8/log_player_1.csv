Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, and I know John will buy it for my minimum price ($1,500,000).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I need to offer a price lower than his valuation, but higher than my minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for me if he accepts. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
