"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's important to start with a price higher than your minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Being friendly:** A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Not too high:**  $175 is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum is $150 and Bob values it at $100. It leaves room for negotiation without being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I have room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While $150 is my minimum, it's not the best outcome.  There's potential to earn more by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's work this out!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility. This indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $160 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the deal aspect to incentivize Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $140 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below it. 
* **Further negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. There's still room for me to increase the price slightly.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While selling to John for $150 is my minimum, I can potentially do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $145. This is a fair price considering the value, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in between my previous offer ($160) and Bob's latest offer ($140). This shows I'm serious about reaching a compromise.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive closing:** I'm asking for Bob's agreement, making it clear that I'm ready to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're already in Round 6, and I've only got 4 rounds left to close the deal.
* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. There's a risk that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll lose interest or even make a counteroffer even lower than $130.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed sale and fulfills my minimum goal. While it's not the best outcome, it's safer than continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
