Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon!"", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $925,000 is a strong opening, it allows space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling around $850,000 - $900,000.
* **Time Constraint:** The mention of a ""fair offer"" and ""decision soon"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John ($800,000), so you're not desperate, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
