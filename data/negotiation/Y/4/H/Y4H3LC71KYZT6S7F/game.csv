"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further and offer the product for $1050000. This price is still very favorable for you, considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
