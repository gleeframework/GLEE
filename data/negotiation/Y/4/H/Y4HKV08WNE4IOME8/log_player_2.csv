"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice would be willing to lower the price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so a counteroffer of $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if he can get a lower price. There's still a chance Alice will be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still significantly below Alice's latest offer, leaving room for further negotiation.  The hope is that Alice will see this as a genuine attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
