I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price from him."

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I hope this shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm not willing to go as low as he's suggested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I want to see if I can meet halfway with Bob.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I'm hoping Bob will see the value in coming to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to be able to get much closer to my desired price. To guarantee myself a decent profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
