"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1200000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal: save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get a better price.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my desired price.  How about $950000? That's still a great deal for you considering the value to you. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than the $1,200,000 he would pay John.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will become unwilling to sell or will make a counteroffer too close to his limit.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** The potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal or delaying the purchase. 

It's better for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
