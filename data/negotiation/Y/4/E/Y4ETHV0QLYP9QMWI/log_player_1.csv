Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) without losing him to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""fair offer"" and ""potential worth"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's high value.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
