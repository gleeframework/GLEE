Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the [Product Name], but I believe I can offer you a fairer deal. I am willing to pay $15000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below my previous counteroffer and is getting closer to my desired price point.  Given that this is a good deal, I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and the risk of losing the sale entirely."
