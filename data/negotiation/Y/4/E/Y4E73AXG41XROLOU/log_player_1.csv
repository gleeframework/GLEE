Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a substantial investment for me. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, I need to signal that I'm serious about the value I place on the product. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open while pushing for a better price."

However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. I'm willing to accept $975,000 - my final offer. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a decision you won't regret."",
