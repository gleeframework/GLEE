# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent about the value of this product. I've already received an offer for $1,200,000 from another interested party. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. I'm willing to accept $975,000 - my final offer. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a decision you won't regret.
