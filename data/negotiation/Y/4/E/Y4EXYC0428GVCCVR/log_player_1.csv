{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's close to the middle of your desired range and Bob's perceived value. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and to see if you can negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below your desired minimum of $10,000. You can likely push for a higher price, especially since Bob clearly values the product at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, so how about $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,750 is just above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's a good deal for you, and you're likely not going to get a significantly better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
