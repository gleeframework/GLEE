"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.  This is a significant markup, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to explore Bob's willingness to pay. If he rejects, I'll see where he lands with his counteroffer.  

I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob stall or go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is a safe option, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counter-offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is inching closer, but his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,000,000, especially since John is a guaranteed sale at that price.  I'll reject his offer again and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm offering $1,025,000.  I'm trying to be flexible but still hold firm on my goal of getting as close to $1,000,000 as possible. This price is a compromise, but it still leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to close the deal. If he doesn't, I'm confident I can close with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close, but I'm starting to run out of time and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. While I'd like to continue negotiating, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds. To avoid risking a lower price, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000. It's the safest option to ensure I get my desired price."
