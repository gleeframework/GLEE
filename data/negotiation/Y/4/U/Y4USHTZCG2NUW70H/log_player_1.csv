Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. It's in excellent condition and I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $130 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $100 offer, ensuring I'm getting a good deal even if Bob rejects it."
