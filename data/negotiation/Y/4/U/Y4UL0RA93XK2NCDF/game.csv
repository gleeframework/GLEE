"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a little bit, Alice. How about we try $75?  I think that's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $75. How about we try $110? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're too far apart on price. I'm willing to offer you $80, which is my absolute limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $115? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",115.0,Alice,7,
