"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's unique value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
