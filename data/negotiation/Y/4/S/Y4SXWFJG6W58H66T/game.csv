"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've seen so far.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $1,900,000 is a significant investment.  How about we settle on $1,750,000? That demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while acknowledging the value of this product.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
