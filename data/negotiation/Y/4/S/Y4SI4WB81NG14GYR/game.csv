"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10500? This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $10000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $500, which will bring the total value of the deal to $10500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product at a great price.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm not interested in the accessory, but I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,8,
