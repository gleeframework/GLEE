"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. How about $13,000? It's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!",13000.0,Bob,4,
