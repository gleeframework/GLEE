**Reasoning:** Bob seems pretty set on a price around $11,000. While further counteroffers are possible, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly higher. Accepting his current offer nets us only $1,000 above our guaranteed sale with John.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward."
