Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'd accept. There's no room for negotiation here. I'll take what I can get.
