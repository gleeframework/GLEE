"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a serious offer and a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
