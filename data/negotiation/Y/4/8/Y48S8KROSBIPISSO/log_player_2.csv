"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though you value the product at $15,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 saves you $3,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You're getting the product for less than your maximum price, and Alice is also getting a decent profit ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000)."
