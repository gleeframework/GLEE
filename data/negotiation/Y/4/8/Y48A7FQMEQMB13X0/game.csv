"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a significant saving over what you value the product at, while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
