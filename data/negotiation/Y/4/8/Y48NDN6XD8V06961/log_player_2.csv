Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $800,000 from her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product,  $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and still gives you a good deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This offer is fair and reflects the value I place on your product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This price is fair, considering the product's value to you.  Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
