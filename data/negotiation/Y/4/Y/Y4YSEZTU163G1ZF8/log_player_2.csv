# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  $16,000 is still higher than his goal of $15,000. He'll counteroffer again to see if they can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $15,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob is willing to pay $15,000, and Alice is at $16,250.  They're not getting close enough to make a deal, and Bob is running out of time.  He's better off going with John and getting the product for his target price."
