"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is a fair reflection of this product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $12,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to accept $13,000 - it's my final offer.  This is a fantastic deal on a product you won't regret owning.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Would you consider $12,500? This would be a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
