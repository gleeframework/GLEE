"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. Can you consider that?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  How about $145?  It's closer to my budget, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",145.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,155.0
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,,
