Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** $120 is still lower than the $150 Bob values the product at. This makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you have room to lower the price a bit while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $120 and you can likely do better.  Let's see if we can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
