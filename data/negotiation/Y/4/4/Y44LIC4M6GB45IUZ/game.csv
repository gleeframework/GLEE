"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,700. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from it.",13700.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,700 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000, so I'm thinking $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  How about we settle at $13,100?  That's my final offer.",13100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I've got to be honest, $13,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if that's something you can work with.",12500.0,Bob,6,
