# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This gives us both a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it for that price from another seller."", ""product_price"": 10000}
