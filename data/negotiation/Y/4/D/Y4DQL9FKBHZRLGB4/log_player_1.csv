Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 to guarantee a sale, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $145 is a price point that's still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but might seem appealing enough to him compared to not getting the product at all.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have the security of selling to John for my minimum price, so there's less risk in aiming slightly higher with Bob."
