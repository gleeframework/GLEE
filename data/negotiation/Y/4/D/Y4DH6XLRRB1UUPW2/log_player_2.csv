"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,050,000) than Alice's opening ($1,400,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Targeting Midpoint:** My goal is to get the price closer to the middle ground between her value ($1,500,000) and my maximum ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  I still have the option to go to John if negotiations don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my maximum of $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might walk away, and I'd end up having to buy from John anyway.  It's worth accepting the small loss to secure the product now."
