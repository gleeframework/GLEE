"Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know you're looking for something like this, and I'm confident it would be worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price below its true value, and I get a fair price for my product. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,
