Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product. 

**Strategy:** 

By starting at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm also keeping the door open for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob may not be willing to pay the full asking price immediately. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll continue to negotiate, potentially lowering the price slightly until I reach a point where I'm comfortable accepting an offer or decide to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $12,500 is below my minimum threshold of $15,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.** 

**Strategy:**

While I'm not happy with Bob's initial counteroffer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000, giving me a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $13,500. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:** This price is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **The message:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value of the product while suggesting a fair deal for both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Bob, bridging the gap between our offers.  This counteroffer is a test to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John at $15,000."
