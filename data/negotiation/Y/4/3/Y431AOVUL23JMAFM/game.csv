"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,400,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,575,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal considering the product's unique value.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,575,000.  How about we settle at $1,550,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
