"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's start from here."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,900,000 is still far too high for Bob. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still significantly above what I'm able to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to a realistic figure, it still falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's getting closer, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's still room for a compromise, and Bob shouldn't be afraid to push further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
