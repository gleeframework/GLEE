"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm going to counter your offer at $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250.  That's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to a deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
