"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  That's a fair price considering the quality of this product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $140 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $150. That's a fair price, and it gets this awesome product into your hands.",150.0,Alice,5,
