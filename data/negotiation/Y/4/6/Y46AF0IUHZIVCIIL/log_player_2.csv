# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?

Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  That's a fair price considering the quality of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$160 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as it's still cheaper than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $140 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $150. That's a fair price, and it gets this awesome product into your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
 
While $150 is closer to my target, it's still more than I'm comfortable paying.  It's best to go with John's offer and save some money."
