I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point that gives me a substantial profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm counter-offering at $900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still securing a significant profit. I'm hopeful this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum threshold.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and the time spent negotiating is costing me potential earnings.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale and meets my minimum requirement."
