Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gets me closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing, as it's still significantly less than what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's initial rejection, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob is unwilling to budge from $13,000. While this is a decent amount, it's still significantly less than what I can get from John. To maximize my profits, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
