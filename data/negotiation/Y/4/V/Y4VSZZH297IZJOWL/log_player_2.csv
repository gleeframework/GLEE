Round 3

# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offers, he's still determined to get it for his maximum price of $8,000. He can counteroffer again and try to convince Alice to meet his price, or just go with John's offer and save time."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I've already met you at $10000 and you rejected it. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is very close to his maximum price, he's still determined to get the product for $8,000. He has 3 rounds left and can counteroffer again. If unsuccessful, he can always go with John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500. While I value the product, I'm still sticking to my budget of $8,000. It's the best I can offer, and I hope you'll reconsider. If not, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement, Bob. I've already met you at $10000, then $9500, and you've rejected both. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $9000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, it's still above his maximum budget. He's already made his stance clear with his repeated counteroffers and Alice has shown reluctance to meet his price. With only one round left, it's better for Bob to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiation.  He'll save himself potential frustration and ensure he gets the product within his budget."
