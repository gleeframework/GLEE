"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer is the best course of action to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can use this time to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it is still outside his budget. There are still 5 rounds remaining, giving Bob an opportunity to try and get Alice closer to his desired price of $10,000. He can use these rounds to demonstrate his commitment to the product and try to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down in price.  While $13,500 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget.  With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting Alice down to Bob's desired price are slim.  Bob has the opportunity to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within his budget and a sure deal. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at his desired price rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice and risking losing the opportunity."
