"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it'd be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $170. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $170 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. How about $140? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can come down a bit, but $140 is a little too low for me. How about $155? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 155} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $145? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm comfortable selling to John for a guaranteed $150.  I'm not confident I can get more from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing out on a certain sale."
