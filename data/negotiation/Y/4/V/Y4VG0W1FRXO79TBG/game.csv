"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant step closer to your last offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
