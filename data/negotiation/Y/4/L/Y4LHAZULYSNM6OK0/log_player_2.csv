"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. Therefore, rejecting the offer and trying to get a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm prepared to offer $875,000.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still higher than Bob's target price. While it's getting closer, there's still room for further negotiation. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to counteroffer, and he has several rounds remaining. It's worthwhile to continue exploring the possibility of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to negotiate. While $915,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This would be a significant savings for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $905,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $905,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $905,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above what he's willing to pay at this point.  Bob has a few rounds left and has already shown a willingness to negotiate. There's still a chance he can get a better price, so it's worth rejecting this offer and trying for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $905,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $895,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 895000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $910,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision. Alice's offer of $910,000 is close to Bob's target price. However, only one round remains. If Bob rejects the offer, he risks Alice refusing to budge further, leaving him with no option but to buy from John for $1,000,000. Given the risk, it's more prudent for Bob to secure the product now from John for $1,000,000 rather than risking a further stalemate with Alice."
