"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **Your maximum budget:** $10,000
* **John's price:** $10,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John at $10,000. This is still within your budget.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better to wait and see if Alice lowers her price or if you can find a better deal elsewhere."
