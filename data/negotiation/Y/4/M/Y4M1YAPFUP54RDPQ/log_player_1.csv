Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $170. This is a slightly higher price than what it's worth to him, but it gives him some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can still get my minimum desired price of $150 from John, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $155. This is a bit more than what Bob offered, but still less than my original offer. I believe this price is a fair compromise and is more likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob is now only offering $145, which is below my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and I'm not willing to risk a further negotiation with Bob."
