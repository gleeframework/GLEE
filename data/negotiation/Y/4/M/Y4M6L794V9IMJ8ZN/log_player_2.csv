"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is offering the product for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice.  You'll get the same product for the same price from John without the risk of the negotiation failing."
