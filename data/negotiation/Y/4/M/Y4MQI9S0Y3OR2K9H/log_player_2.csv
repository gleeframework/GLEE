{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is way too high.  We need to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Let's start with a significant discount. This is a reasonable starting point, and if she's unwilling to come down that much, I'll likely go with John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Alice is still asking for too much. I'm willing to pay more than $1 million, but $1.8 million is still too steep. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a compromise offer,  hopefully, Alice will see this is a good price for her, and we can close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'd prefer to try to get a better deal if possible.  We're running out of rounds so I'll likely be forced to buy from John if she doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

This is my final offer before I go with John. I'm willing to pay a premium over my limit, but only slightly. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a good deal for her and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, and we are running out of rounds. I'm going to accept this offer, even though it's slightly above my limit. It's better to pay a little extra than risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
