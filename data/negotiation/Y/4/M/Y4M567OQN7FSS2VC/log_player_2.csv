"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's intent to negotiate aggressively.
* **Fairness Argument:**  Bob frames the offer as beneficial for both parties, adding a touch of persuasion.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $11,500 still leaves room for further negotiation, allowing for a potential compromise in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $12,500 is significantly lower than the price Bob would pay from John ($15,000) and only slightly more than Bob's counteroffer ($11,500).
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, it's advantageous to accept a deal that is relatively close to Bob's desired price. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, where Alice may not budge further and Bob is forced to buy from John at a higher price."
