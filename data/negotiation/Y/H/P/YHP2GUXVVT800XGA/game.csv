"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations at that price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can we meet in the middle again?",11500.0,Bob,4,
