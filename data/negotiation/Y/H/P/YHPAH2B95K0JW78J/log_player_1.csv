Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be of great value to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Bob's Maximum Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000. We want to get as close to that as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $13,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of and could scare him off. 
* **Secure a Significant Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $13,000 represents a $5,000 profit, which is significantly more than the $8,000 backup offer from John. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
