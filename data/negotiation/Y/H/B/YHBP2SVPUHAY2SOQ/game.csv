"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I'll offer you a revised price of $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
