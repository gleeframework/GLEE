Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120.  I believe it's worth much more, but I'm offering you this price as a special deal."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, increasing your profit.
* **Justify the Price:**  By mentioning you believe it's worth more and framing it as a ""special deal,"" you create the perception of value.

This strategy balances getting a high price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to accept."
