""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob first.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it for that amount or slightly higher wouldn't be strategic.
* **Finding a Balance:** The offer of $1,350,000 sits comfortably between Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting the product's exclusivity and potential value aims to justify the higher price point to Bob."
