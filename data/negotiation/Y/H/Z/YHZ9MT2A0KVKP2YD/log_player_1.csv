Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $5) while maximizing your profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 provides leverage to aim higher with Bob."
