"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I get a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will find the value proposition worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $14,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair given Bob's earlier offer and my own desired profit margin."
