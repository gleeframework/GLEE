Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""time-sensitive"" are used to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially increase his perceived value of the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum of $15,000.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. If he rejects the offer, you still have the security of selling to John at your desired minimum price."
