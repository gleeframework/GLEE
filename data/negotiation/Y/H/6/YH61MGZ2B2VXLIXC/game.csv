"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
