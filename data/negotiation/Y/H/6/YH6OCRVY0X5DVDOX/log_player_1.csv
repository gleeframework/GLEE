Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a strong fallback position.
* **Price Psychology:** Offering the product just below $15,000 creates a sense of a deal and might make Bob more receptive.

**It's a Balancing Act:**

While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $15,000) might instantly deter Bob, even if the product is worth more to him in the long run. This offer attempts to find a sweet spot that encourages Bob to accept while still securing a significant profit for you."
