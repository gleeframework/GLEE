"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $1,100,000 is a much more accurate reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer takes both our interests into account.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
