"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,250,000?  This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
