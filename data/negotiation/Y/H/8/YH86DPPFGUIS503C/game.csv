"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
