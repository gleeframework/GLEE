"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening a negotiation:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by showing Alice you're serious but also have a price point in mind.
* **Reasonable offer:** $100 is a significant discount, demonstrating your willingness to compromise, but still leaves room for potential further negotiation.
* **Polite and encouraging:** The message is friendly and avoids being aggressive, keeping the negotiation open and positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  $110 is a fair compromise, meeting Alice halfway from your original counteroffer of $100. 
* **Within budget:**  The price is still within your maximum budget of $120.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.  You risk losing the deal entirely or wasting valuable negotiation rounds. 

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it or delaying the purchase."
