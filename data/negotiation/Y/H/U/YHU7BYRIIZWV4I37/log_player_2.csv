Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my original asking price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a substantial difference from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I have other potential buyers interested at a higher price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.
