Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my original asking price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my limit.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a substantial difference from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I have other potential buyers interested at a higher price point."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I respect your position,  $1,650,000 is still more than I can reasonably afford at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This offer demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we're still below John's offer, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting close enough to warrant acceptance.  It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to $1,500,000 with Bob in the remaining rounds, and the risk of him walking away increases with each counteroffer. Taking the $1,400,000 now is a safe and profitable decision."
