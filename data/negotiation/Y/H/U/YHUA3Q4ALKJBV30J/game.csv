"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's split the difference and make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is still a bit above your initial offer but closer to my original price. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,5,
