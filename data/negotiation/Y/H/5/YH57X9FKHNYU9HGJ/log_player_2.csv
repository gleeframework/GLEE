"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  My asking price is $140, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Be polite and keep negotiations open:**  We acknowledge Alice's offer and express continued interest.
* **Anchor low:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $150 maximum and John's offer.
* **Appear reasonable:** While the offer is low, it's not offensively so and leaves space for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice met us halfway between our initial offers.  $125 is a good price, well below our maximum and John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice."
