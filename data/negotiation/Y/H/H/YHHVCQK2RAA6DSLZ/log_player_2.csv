Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500.  It's better to buy from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
