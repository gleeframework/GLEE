Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to be made.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. Aiming too low risks losing out on potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps things professional, highlights the product's value, and positions the price as justified.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 provides a compelling incentive for Bob (a $50,000 gain) while securing a $150,000 profit for you â€“ significantly more than John's offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive or agreeable), you can adjust your offer accordingly.
* **Relationship:** A long-term business relationship might make you consider a slightly lower price for mutual benefit in the future.

This offer balances profit maximization with a strong likelihood of acceptance, but be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters."
