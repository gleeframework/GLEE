"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would significantly benefit your business. Given its immense value, I am offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its exceptional quality and the strategic advantage it offers. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This price is a fair compromise, reflecting the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the high value of the product to you, I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. However, I must maintain a reasonable margin for my business. Therefore, I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This price still reflects its worth while allowing for a fair transaction between us. I look forward to your feedback on this proposal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to my ideal price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John for $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting her offer is the best course of action."
