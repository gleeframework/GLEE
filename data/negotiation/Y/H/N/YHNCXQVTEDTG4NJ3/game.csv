"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This price is a fair compromise, reflecting the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the high value of the product to you, I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. However, I must maintain a reasonable margin for my business. Therefore, I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This price still reflects its worth while allowing for a fair transaction between us. I look forward to your feedback on this proposal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
