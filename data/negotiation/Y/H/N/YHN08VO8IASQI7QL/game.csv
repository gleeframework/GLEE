"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that price point be workable?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
