"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $110.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to You:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** $110 
* **John's Price:** $150

Buying from Alice saves you $40 ($150 - $110) compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice, the offer is already within your budget and significantly cheaper than John's price."
