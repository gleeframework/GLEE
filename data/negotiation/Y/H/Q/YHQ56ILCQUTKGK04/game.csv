"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, to be transparent, $950,000 is below the product's true value and represents a significant discount for me. My final offer is $1,025,000. I believe this reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your position.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
