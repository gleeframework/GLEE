"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget and what John is offering. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's low enough to give room for bargaining but still demonstrates a serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, but it's still more than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counter-offer aims to find a compromise. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my price limit and is offering the product for the same price as John. There's no point in further negotiation or going to John. It's time to accept the deal."
