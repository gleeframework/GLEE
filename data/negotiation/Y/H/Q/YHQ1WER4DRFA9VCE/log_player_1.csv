``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, while also demonstrating my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm going to try to get a better price by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'll try one more counteroffer before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,800 is still below my minimum.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

This is a tough decision, but I'm not going to budge any further on price.  I'm confident John will be happy to pay my asking price, and that's the best outcome for me right now."
