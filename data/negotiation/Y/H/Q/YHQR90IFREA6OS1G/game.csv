"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",999000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $999000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can afford while still finding this a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $825000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I believe it's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
