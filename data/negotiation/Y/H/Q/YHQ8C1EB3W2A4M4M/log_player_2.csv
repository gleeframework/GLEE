"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your target price of $1,000,000. It's too early to buy from John, as you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good return as well.  Let's start the negotiation with this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above your target price, but she is showing a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your goal. You can likely reach a mutually acceptable price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This offer is closer to your last offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your target price, but you can still potentially negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process. You might be able to convince Alice to come down a bit more, or you can choose to buy from John if you don't think you can get a better price from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
