You can get a better deal.  You're still $200,000 over your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

I'm offering Alice $850,000.  This is still a good deal for her, as it's more than half of what the product is worth to her. It also gives me some room to potentially negotiate further if needed."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still $150,000 more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $900,000. This is a compromise, and hopefully it's a good enough offer for her to accept. It's only $50,000 more than my last offer and is closer to her desired price."
