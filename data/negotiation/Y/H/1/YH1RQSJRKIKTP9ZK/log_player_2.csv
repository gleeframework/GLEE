Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to sell for $100, as that's below my minimum price. I can do $125, but that's as low as I'll go.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $120, and we know we can get the product for $100 from John. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
