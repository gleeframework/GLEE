"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring to your operations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its value, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher investment. Could you consider a price around $1,800,000? This allows for some negotiation while still reflecting the value it brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep my investment within a reasonable limit. I would like to propose a price closer to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that respects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground. However, I must stick to my budget constraints. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
