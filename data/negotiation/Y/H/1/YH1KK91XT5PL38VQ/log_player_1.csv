Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its value, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher investment. Could you consider a price around $1,800,000? This allows for some negotiation while still reflecting the value it brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep my investment within a reasonable limit. I would like to propose a price closer to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that respects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're still below John's offer, and Bob's counteroffers are increasing. There's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,550,000?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground. However, I must stick to my budget constraints. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we're still slightly below John's offer, Bob's offer is now very close to our minimum. It's unlikely we can push him much further, and continuing the negotiation risks losing him entirely. Accepting the $1,400,000 offer ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
