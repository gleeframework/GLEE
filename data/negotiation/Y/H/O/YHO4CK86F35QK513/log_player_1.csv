Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation while still ensuring the deal is significantly more attractive to you than selling to John. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves you with a $350,000 profit margin over your guaranteed sale.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, the message implies you're open to discussing the price further if Bob has concerns. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to allow room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you could consider a slightly lower price.

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
