"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850000?  That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's keep this deal moving forward!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your point, but $780000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference.  How about $815000? That's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",815000.0,Alice,5,
