"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's below my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see value in this offer as it's significantly less than his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum value. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm still above my minimum value, but I'm also hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm running out of time, I'm not willing to sell for a price that undervalues the product for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm reducing my price again to $13,000. This is getting close to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I need to be flexible to close the deal, but I'm not willing to go below $12,500 at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've already made significant concessions and am nearing my minimum value.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I receive a price that's fair to me, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
