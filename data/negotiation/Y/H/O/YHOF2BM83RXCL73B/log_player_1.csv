Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit on the sale.  I believe this price is reasonable, given the value of the product to Bob.  Let's see if he's interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still ensures I get a profit.  Let's see if this gets us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and is also more than what I would get from John. I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
