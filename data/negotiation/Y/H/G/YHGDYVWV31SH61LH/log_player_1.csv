Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob recognizes the value. He saves $50,000 compared to its worth to him, and you earn $150,000 more than your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers adds a level of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have time to negotiate with Bob before selling to John. If time is a critical factor, you might offer a slightly lower price to ensure a quicker deal."
