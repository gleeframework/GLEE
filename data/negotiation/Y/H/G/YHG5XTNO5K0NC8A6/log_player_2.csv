"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price (at least $8,000, as that's Alice's minimum) and still save money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a good starting point,  showing he's serious about buying but also aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has time to get a better deal. He should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking with his strategy of offering just above Alice's minimum. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility but not conceding too much.  He hopes this will get Alice closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money and hasn't reached his maximum price yet.  He should keep negotiating with Alice. He can get the product for a lower price than John's offer, and there's a chance he can convince Alice to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum acceptable price, but he still wants to save as much as possible.  He's raised his offer again, showing flexibility, but he's also testing Alice's limits.  If she rejects this offer, he might consider going to John, but he wants to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget of $12,000.  Alice's offer of $9,800 is only $200 more than his last offer.  With only three rounds left, Bob is taking a calculated risk by accepting the offer to avoid risking losing the deal.  He's also likely considering that Alice might be less willing to lower her price further in the remaining rounds, making this offer a good compromise."
