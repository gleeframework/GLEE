"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It's clear you recognize the value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $920,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $870,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",870000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be upfront â€“ $870,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm open to finding a solution, but I can't go below $900,000.  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what we both gain from this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
