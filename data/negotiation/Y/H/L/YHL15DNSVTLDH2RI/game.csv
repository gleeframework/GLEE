"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $2000000. This is a substantial discount given its true worth. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1400000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it reflects the true value of this opportunity. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1600000 is still a bit high. I'd like to propose a price of $1500000. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
