# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $2000000. This is a substantial discount given its true worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is there any flexibility on the price?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1400000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it reflects the true value of this opportunity. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
