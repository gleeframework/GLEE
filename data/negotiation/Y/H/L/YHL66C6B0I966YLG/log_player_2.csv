"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a great price of $130.  I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product from John for $150, so you shouldn't accept an offer higher than that.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $115? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$115 is still too high. You want to keep the price as low as possible and you have time to negotiate.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you another opportunity to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
