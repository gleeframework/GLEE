"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $115? It's a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This would be a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
