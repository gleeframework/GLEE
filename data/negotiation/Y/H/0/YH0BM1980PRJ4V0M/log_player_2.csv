# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $12,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price.  Let's see if we can find a figure that works for both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $11,500 for it?  This way, we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.
