"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value and potential of the product, while also being closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our needs.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
