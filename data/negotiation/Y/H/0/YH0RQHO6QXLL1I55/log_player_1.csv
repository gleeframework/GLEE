Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John.
* **Justify the Price:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces to Bob that the product is worth a significant investment to him. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
