Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000. This is your safety net.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This is the absolute ceiling of what he'd logically pay.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This offer starts closer to your minimum acceptable price while still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair offer"" projects value.
* **Focus on Benefits:**  Instead of dwelling on the price, remind Bob of the ""unique value and potential"" of the product.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter with a lower offer. Be prepared to negotiate slightly, but hold firm to a price above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your $1,500,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could start lower if you want to increase the chances of a quick sale, but remember your strong BATNA."
