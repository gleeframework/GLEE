"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It's above my minimum, but leaves room for compromise.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm being friendly and open to negotiation. 
* **Setting the stage:**  I'm giving Bob a reason to be interested (""I think you'd be interested"")."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  $100 is still above my minimum of $80, but it's significantly lower than my starting point.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price. 
* **Time to counter:** I'm going to use this opportunity to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing it as a ""fair price for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see my perspective.
* **Not giving in completely:** I'm still holding out for a higher price than $100, hoping to close the gap."
