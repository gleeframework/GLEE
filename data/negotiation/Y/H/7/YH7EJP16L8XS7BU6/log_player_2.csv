"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,250 is a good deal for you. It's significantly less than John's price of $12,000, and you're still getting the product for a price lower than your initial maximum of $12,000."
