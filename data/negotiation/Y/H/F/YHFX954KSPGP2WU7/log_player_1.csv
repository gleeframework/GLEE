Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's worth to me is considerably higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,750,000 is still more than I can realistically pay. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your expectations.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is offering. It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed offer from John."
