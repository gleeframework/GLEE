# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than your budget and significantly more than the product is worth to you. It's better to reject her offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, it's still over $500,000 more than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
