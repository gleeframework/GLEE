Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $12,000 to me and $10,000 to him. It leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
