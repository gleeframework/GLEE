Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This offer reflects a substantial investment on my part and would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident it's worth a premium, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  This offer is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his current offer of $900,000. While continuing the negotiation *might* net a slightly higher price, the difference is marginal compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Accepting John's offer ensures a secure and immediate profit."
