"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and see if he's willing to pay more than his initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm dropping my price to my minimum value of $15,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I won't go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more. There are rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going down slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but staying above my minimum price of $15,000. This will hopefully convince Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through multiple rounds and Bob hasn't moved much from his initial counteroffer. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which meets my minimum requirement."
