Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice absolutely won't sell below $1,500,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. He'll only buy if the price is at or below this value.
* **The Zone of Agreement:** There's no overlap between what Alice will accept and what Bob is willing to pay.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since there's no possibility of a mutually beneficial deal, Alice's best move is to offer a price that Bob will reject. This ensures she can sell the product to John at her desired price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value and market demand, I'm offering it at $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Why this Works**

* **Price Above Bob's Valuation:** The offered price is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at, ensuring he'll reject it.
* **Maintains Credibility:**  Offering a price slightly above John's offer maintains a semblance of negotiation and doesn't make Alice appear desperate.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice cannot reveal John's offer to Bob or engage in any unethical negotiation tactics."
