"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: Alice's first offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

Explanation: We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we're still aiming to pay closer to $70.  We'll reject and counter-offer, trying to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Explanation: We're inching closer to a deal. This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($85) and our previous counteroffer ($75). It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $82.50. It's a fair price that should make both of us happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: While $82.50 is tempting, we're in round 5 and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can nudge her down just a bit more before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $80, but that's my final offer.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

Explanation:  We're getting close to the end of our negotiating window. Offering $80 meets Alice at her product's value and is a strong offer. By stating it's our final offer, we're signaling that we're serious and ready to walk away if she doesn't accept. This tactic can encourage a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I need to consider the effort I've put into this negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer at $82. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: Alice has signaled that $82 is her bottom line. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better price. Accepting at $82 secures a decent discount from our alternatives ($100 from John or $82.50 from Alice earlier)."
