"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is too low.  I can do better, especially since I know he values the product at $1,200,000.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $950,000?  This way, we both get a good deal and I can move on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900000. This is a good compromise and allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $900,000.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to secure the deal.  While I initially hoped for more, it's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $800,000.  This is a better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a worse offer or running out of rounds."
