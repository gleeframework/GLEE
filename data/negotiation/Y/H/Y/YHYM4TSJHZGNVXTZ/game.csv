"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $950000?  This way, we both get a good deal and I can move on to other opportunities.",950000.0,Alice,3,
