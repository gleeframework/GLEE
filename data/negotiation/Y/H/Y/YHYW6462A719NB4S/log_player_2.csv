"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's worth even more to you given its value to you is $100. Let's make this transaction beneficial for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a better price than $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However, $95 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, as it aligns better with my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $80 while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $85 is a significant step down from $95, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To move forward, I propose we settle on $90 for the product. This price still allows me to feel fairly compensated while remaining within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $95, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $85. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $87.  This would be a great compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that's just a few dollars above Alice's likely minimum.  This demonstrates that Bob is serious about a deal, but still wants to save some money.  By offering $87, Bob leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a final price of $88 or $89, which would still be acceptable to Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're looking for a fair deal, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to offer the product to you for $89. This price still allows me to feel fairly compensated, while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to Bob's desired price of $87.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John for $100 is now higher.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob a decent price and avoids any potential delays or complications with John."
