"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's worth even more to you given its value to you is $100. Let's make this transaction beneficial for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However, $95 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, as it aligns better with my budget.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To move forward, I propose we settle on $90 for the product. This price still allows me to feel fairly compensated while remaining within your budget constraints.",90.0,Alice,3,
