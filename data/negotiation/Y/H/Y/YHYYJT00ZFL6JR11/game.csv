"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $105. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $105. This is my final offer, let's close the deal.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $115, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $10. So, the total price for the product would be $105, but you'll also get the accessory for free. It's a one-time offer, so think carefully before responding.",105.0,Alice,7,
