Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows you to make a good profit, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that. How about we try to finalize this now? I'm willing to go up to $990,000.  That's a significant move on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers aren't getting close enough to my target price. It's better to secure a sale with John now rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
