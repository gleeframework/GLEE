"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth more than $120 to me. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I would like to propose a starting price of $90. This is a special opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $90 is above Bob's maximum price of $80. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it, given my maximum budget and the potential for a deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. By offering $75, Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also that he's not willing to pay her asking price. This should encourage Alice to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a reasonable profit margin for myself. Therefore, I propose a price of $80 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $80 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. While he could reject and try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to compromise or even withdrawing the offer entirely. Given the limited rounds and the availability of the product from John at the same price, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice. Bob gets the product at his desired price without risking losing the opportunity to a potential counteroffer."
