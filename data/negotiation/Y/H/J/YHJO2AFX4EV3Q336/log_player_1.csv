Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a bit higher than what it's worth to him, but I'm hoping to secure a good price and avoid having to deal with John, who will only offer me the minimum. I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for the same price."
