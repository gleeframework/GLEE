"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my asking price but still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer and send a counteroffer. I don't want to pay $1,200,000, that's too high.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a significant discount from her initial offer. Here's my counteroffer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves you a substantial profit while allowing me to earn closer to my desired value. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm open to further discussion if needed.
