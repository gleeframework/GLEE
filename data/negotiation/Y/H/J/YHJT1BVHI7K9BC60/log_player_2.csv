Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I'm willing to drop the price to $10,000, but that's my absolute lowest.  It's a very fair price for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think.

Alice is unlikely to go below her $10,000 valuation.  It's better to cut my losses and secure the product from John for $8,000."
