"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is a little too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its value to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $650,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to its value to me. I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its value to me.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
