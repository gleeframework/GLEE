Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being open to a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and make a decision based on how close it is to my desired price and how confident I am in securing a better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,400,000 to see if I can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
