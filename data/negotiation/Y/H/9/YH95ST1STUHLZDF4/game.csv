"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This would be a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,900.  I feel like this is a very fair offer, considering I can buy it for $10,000 elsewhere.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,900 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is closer to your last offer and  right at my minimum acceptable price.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
