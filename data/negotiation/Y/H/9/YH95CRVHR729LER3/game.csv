"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit steep for my current budget.  I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable going up to $1000000.  This is my final offer â€“ if it works for you, let's close the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
