Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $14,000 is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $14,000 is still above your minimum price of $15,000, ensuring you don't lose out on too much profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price creates space for potential counteroffers and allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

By starting at a slightly higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to come up to meet you in the middle.  If not, you can always counter or go to John, your alternative buyer, to secure your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $12,500 is lower than your minimum price of $15,000. Accepting would mean losing a significant amount of profit.
* **You have a better option:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000. This is a much better outcome than selling to Bob at his current offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a price closer to your minimum or even higher. 

**Next Steps:** You should counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to your minimum. This will allow you to test his willingness to pay more and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,250? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between your initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). 
* **Attractive to Bob:** $13,250 is still below your minimum price and closer to what Bob offered, making it more appealing than your previous offer.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more on his price. If he rejects again, you can still consider selling to John or making a slightly lower counteroffer.

This approach is strategic because it allows you to: 
* **Negotiate strategically:**  By starting at a higher price and gradually lowering it, you can test Bob's limits and potentially maximize your profit.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing you have a backup offer from John keeps you in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $13,000 is still above your minimum price of $15,000, meaning you are making a profit. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $13,000 is a good deal, there's still a chance you could get closer to your desired price with further negotiation. However, this comes with the risk of Bob backing out or you needing to sell to John.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a profitable price without the risk of further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

If you want to try for a higher price, you could counter Bob's offer with $13,100 or $13,150, but this might risk losing the deal altogether.  Given the possibility of selling to John, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this stage."
