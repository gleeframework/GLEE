"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,250? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think!",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
