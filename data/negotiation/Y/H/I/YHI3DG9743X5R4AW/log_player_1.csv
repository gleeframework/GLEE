"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price ($200) to see if Bob is genuinely interested and to leave room for negotiation. I'm also stating my openness to negotiation to keep the conversation friendly and encourage Bob to counter-offer.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than my minimum of $150, I believe I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my initial asking price. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $185? I think this is a fair price for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 185}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $185. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and I'd like to propose $180 as the price for the product. This seems like a fair compromise given the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $180 is a good price, and it's getting close to my initial asking price.  It's also a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more. It's better to secure a good price than potentially end up with John's offer of $150."
