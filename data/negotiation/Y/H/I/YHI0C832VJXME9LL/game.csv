"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of your product, $1,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring your product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
