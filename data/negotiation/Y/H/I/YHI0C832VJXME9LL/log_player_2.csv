"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to accept the offer right away, and buying from John immediately would mean losing any potential savings.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I acknowledge the value of your product, $1,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's original offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's only 100,000 away from his ideal price with John, so rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring your product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
