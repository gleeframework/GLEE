"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can generate substantial returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.  While I know Bob values it at $1,000,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium for it. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John, offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, provides a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's highly likely we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $750,000 undervalues the potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** The counteroffer drops by $200,000, showing a willingness to negotiate, but stays well above both my $1,000,000 floor and Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** The message reiterates the product's potential value to justify a higher price point.  
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  A quick and decisive counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I need the price to be more realistic. I can go up to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there are rounds left, and I believe Bob might be persuaded to go higher. John's offer provides a safety net, but I'm aiming to secure a deal that's more beneficial than my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. It seems we're closing the gap.  To be straightforward, I'm seeking a price closer to $1,200,000. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000?  This recognizes the value while making it a compelling deal for you."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between our last two offers, signaling a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a strong profit.
* **Clear Bottom Line:** The message now explicitly mentions my target price range (""closer to $1,200,000""), which provides transparency and reinforces my position.
* **Value Framing:**  I'm highlighting how this price benefits both parties (""recognizes the value while making it a compelling deal""). 
* **Time Consideration:** With more than half the rounds remaining, I have room to negotiate further if needed. However, this offer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate the compromise.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Reserve, Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is above my $1,000,000 minimum and represents a very good profit. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:** We've established a pattern of meeting in the middle, and continuing to push might make Bob less willing to negotiate.
* **Time Value:**  While more rounds are left, securing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting this offer is more profitable than selling to John for $1,000,000 at this point."
