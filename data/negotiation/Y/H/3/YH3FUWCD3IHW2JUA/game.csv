"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,325,000? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,337,500? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to close this deal.",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $1,320,000? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to commit to buying the product at this price.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
