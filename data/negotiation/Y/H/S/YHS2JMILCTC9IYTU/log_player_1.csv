"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for some room for negotiation. It's also important to note that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 at any time, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. It's a compromise from my initial offer and shows good faith, while still being significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good price considering my minimum and it's only one round away from my last counteroffer.  I'm confident I can't get much higher with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
