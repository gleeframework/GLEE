Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows some room for Bob to negotiate up slightly if he's interested, getting me closer to my maximum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the message emphasizes ""special price"" and ""value"" to make it seem more appealing. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
