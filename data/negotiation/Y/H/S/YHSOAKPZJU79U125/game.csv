"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However,  $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
