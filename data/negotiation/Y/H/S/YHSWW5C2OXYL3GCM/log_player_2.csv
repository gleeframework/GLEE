"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. I know it's worth $80 to you, but I'm offering it for a special price of $90. If you're interested, let me know! Otherwise, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her initial asking price, it's still higher than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and save the extra $10."
