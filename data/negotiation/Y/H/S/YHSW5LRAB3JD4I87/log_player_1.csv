"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $1,500,000 is a strong opening bid, but still leaves space for Bob to negotiate.  I'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm still optimistic that we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal considering the back and forth. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
