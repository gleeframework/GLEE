"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet halfway at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,320,000 as my final offer - this represents a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while offering you a fantastic deal.  What do you say?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
