"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her first offer, it's still above his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product at his maximum price point than to continue negotiating with Alice."
