"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $17,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $17,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $15,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,500 is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still too high. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up to $14,000, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  It's a fair price for both of us and reflects the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate. While $14,500 is close to his limit, he can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,250. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 14250}
