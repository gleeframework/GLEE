"Alice,  $17,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $15,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up to $14,000, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  It's a fair price for both of us and reflects the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $14,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,250. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",14250.0,Bob,6,
