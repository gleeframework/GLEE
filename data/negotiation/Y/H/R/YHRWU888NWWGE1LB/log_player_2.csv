# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I still think I can get a better price for this product. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. This is my last offer, so I expect you to accept it.

While we could try to haggle further, Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  Getting the product for $1,050,000 is a reasonable deal given our $1,500,000 limit and the fact that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price."
