Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this now!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with another buyer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $81. While it's just $1 more than John's price, sticking to your budget and buying from John ensures you get the best possible deal. There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, even with more rounds of negotiation."
