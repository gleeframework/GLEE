"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really need to make a bit more profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $92? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal.",92.0,Alice,5,
