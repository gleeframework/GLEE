"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to us is $150 and its high quality. I believe this price will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet my expectations. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $105 for the product. My offer stands at $120, as it aligns closely with the value we place on it. I would like to continue our discussion to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated that she is not willing to negotiate further, and she has stuck to her original offer of $120.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $100, as he can save $20 compared to accepting Alice's offer.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a lower price, and Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate."
