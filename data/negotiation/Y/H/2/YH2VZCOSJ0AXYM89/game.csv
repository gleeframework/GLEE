"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer you $10,500 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable going up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,750 is still too low for me. How about we settle this at $10,900?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,
