"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $12,500 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm willing to go up to $12,500, I can't justify paying more than that. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",12300.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,300 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $12,400? This is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?",12400.0,Alice,5,
