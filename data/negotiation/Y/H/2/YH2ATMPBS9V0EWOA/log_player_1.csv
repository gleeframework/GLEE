Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $12,500 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm willing to go up to $12,500, I can't justify paying more than that. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's come up a bit, I'm still not comfortable selling for $12,300. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,300 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $12,400? This is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12400}
