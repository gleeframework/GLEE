Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $115 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation and can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Backup plan:** I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Negotiation:** While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer who will pay $120 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic is common in negotiations and often signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the deal for Bob while maintaining my firm stance on price.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  $110 is closer to my minimum price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters again."
