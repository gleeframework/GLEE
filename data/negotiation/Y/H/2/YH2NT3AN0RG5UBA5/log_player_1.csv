Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $8,000.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $8,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and while I'd prefer to get more, it's a reasonable offer.  Accepting it ensures a sale, and I can always try to find a better deal later on."
