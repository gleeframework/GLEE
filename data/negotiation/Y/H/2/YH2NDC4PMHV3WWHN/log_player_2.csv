Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $790,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is consistently making very small concessions.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's getting risky. Accepting at $815,000 guarantees a good deal without the risk of Alice digging in her heels or the price going up in a counter-offer."
