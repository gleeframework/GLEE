Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.
