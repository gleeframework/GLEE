{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  The negotiations with Bob have been going on for a while, and we're not making significant progress. I've made several concessions, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a deal with John and ensure a profit than to risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob that may not lead to a successful outcome."
