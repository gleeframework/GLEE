Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value ($15,000) but higher than Bob's estimated value ($12,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **""It's a great deal for you...""** This is a subtle way to emphasize the value Bob gets. 
* **""...good starting point for our negotiation...""** This signals openness to further discussion.

By starting with a slightly lower offer, I aim to:

* **Get Bob interested:** It's more likely Bob will accept or counter-offer than if I started at my minimum price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This gives me flexibility to adjust my price if needed, while still aiming for a profit.
* **Show I'm willing to work with him:** This builds a foundation for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $14,000 at this point.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

By rejecting his offer, I can counter-offer and continue the negotiation. This will give me a chance to potentially get a better price, while still keeping the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Value of the product:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize its worth, and justify my slightly higher price.
* **Mutually beneficial agreement:** I emphasize that this price is beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the deal:**  This phrase adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to seriously consider my offer.

By offering $13,250, I'm:

* **Staying above my minimum:**  This ensures I'm not selling below my desired value.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, I can still counter-offer again, but closer to his price.
* **Showing I'm serious:** My willingness to compromise makes me a more credible negotiator."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum desired value of $15,000. It's also significantly higher than his initial offer of $12,500, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.

While I could continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my $15,000 goal, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, or that I might lose time and effort.

Therefore, accepting his offer at $13,000 is a smart decision. It secures a decent profit for me while still satisfying Bob's needs. This ensures a successful transaction and avoids potential delays or complications."
