"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I'm confident the product's true worth is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,390,000? This price reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1390000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To find a solution, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,370,000. I believe this represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1370000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,370,000 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,350,000 is a fair price for the product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
