"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,325,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $20,000. This way, you'll be getting more value for your money. I'm sticking with my price of $1,325,000, but I'm adding the extra service to make it a more attractive offer.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
