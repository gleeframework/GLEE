# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation, so I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a lower price by continuing to counter."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1075000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is only slightly higher than my last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,500,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept."
