Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  To kick things off, I propose a price of $1,800,000."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's still early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly willing to move closer to my price range, but I'm aiming higher. I'll counteroffer again to see if there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. Let's make this happen - how about we settle at $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly trying to reach a fair deal, and at $1,450,000, the offer is strong enough to accept. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and further negotiation might not yield much more. It's time to close the deal."
