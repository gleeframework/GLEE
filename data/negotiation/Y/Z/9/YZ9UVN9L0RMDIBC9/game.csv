"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering our respective positions.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand the product's potential, $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing negotiations.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
