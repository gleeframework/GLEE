"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I acknowledge the value you've mentioned, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This would allow me to make this deal work while still achieving a fair outcome for both of us. I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come up a bit. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. I'm getting close to the point where I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",975000.0,Bob,6,
