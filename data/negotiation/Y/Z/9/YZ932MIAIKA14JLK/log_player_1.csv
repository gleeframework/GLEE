{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a high price while acknowledging that Bob has a lower valuation. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to strike a deal that benefits both of us. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll have the opportunity to gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. 

This approach allows for flexibility and potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if I can get a better price through further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  There's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **No Immediate Need:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation and allows me to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that reflects my desire for a price closer to $1,200,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I acknowledge the value you've mentioned, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This would allow me to make this deal work while still achieving a fair outcome for both of us. I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come up a bit. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial proposal. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a middle ground. It acknowledges Bob's perspective while emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer. This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate further. 

By offering a slightly lower price and highlighting the potential for a win-win situation, I hope to encourage Bob to reconsider and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Considerations:**  $950,000 is a substantial amount of money, but it represents a significant loss for me compared to what I could get from John.
* **Time and Effort:** I've already invested time and effort in negotiating with Bob, but continuing to haggle at this point might not be worth the potential gain. 
* **Guaranteed Buyer:** Having John as an option provides a safety net. I don't have to settle for a price that's not satisfactory to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still reflects a willingness to reach an agreement. If Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my expectations, I'll ultimately choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,025,000:** This is a middle ground between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Message:** The message maintains a friendly tone and emphasizes compromise. It acknowledges Bob's perspective while presenting a final offer that feels fair to both parties. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a significant concession here, showing flexibility and a genuine desire to reach an agreement. By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to make it clear that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm also not willing to go below a certain price.

This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's a calculated risk, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. I'm getting close to the point where I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've made concessions, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is far below the value I place on the product. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my asking price, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Buyer:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer eliminates the risk of losing out on a sale.
* **Financial Gain:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 will result in a significantly higher profit than accepting Bob's final offer.
* **Time and Effort:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a significantly better outcome, and I would rather not waste more time trying to convince him.

It's time to move on and sell the product to John for a price that reflects its true value."
