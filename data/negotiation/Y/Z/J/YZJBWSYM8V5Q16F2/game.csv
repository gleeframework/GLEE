"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I know will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $600,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. It's clear to both of us that it's worth a significant sum. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end while ensuring a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to meet me a bit more on the price.  I'm willing to go to $825,000.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,6,
