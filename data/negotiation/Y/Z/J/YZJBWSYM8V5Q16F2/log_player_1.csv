"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I know will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a significantly high offer ($1,800,000) to establish a strong initial position. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price well above my minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Using language like ""unique,"" ""incredibly valuable,"" and ""fair reflection"" emphasizes the product's worth and justifies the high price.
* **Leaving Room:** I understand this is just the first round and that Bob might counter. By starting high, I create space for negotiation and potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his counter was aggressive, it shows he's interested. I'll reject and counter in Round 3 to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $600,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. It's clear to both of us that it's worth a significant sum. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Rejecting:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating that it's too low, emphasizing the product's ""unique advantages.""
* **Common Ground:** I highlight that we both recognize the product's high value, building a sense of agreement.
* **Significant Concession:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a substantial drop from my initial price, signaling flexibility but also setting a firm floor above my minimum.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This phrase suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving in the right direction, $750,000 is still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum.  It's clear he sees substantial value in the product. I'll reject and offer another counter in Round 5, moving closer to the middle ground but staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end while ensuring a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I acknowledge Bob's efforts and frame the negotiation positively as ""finding a solution that works for both of us.""
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm dropping my price to $1,050,000, which is just above my minimum. This shows a significant move towards Bob while setting a firm boundary.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price and discourage further low counteroffers.
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:**  This language implies that accepting this offer would be a win-win scenario for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to meet me a bit more on the price.  I'm willing to go to $825,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product, even with his latest offer of $825,000. While he's moving closer to my minimum, the progress is slow. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. 

At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob carries a risk. He might not be willing to meet my minimum price within the remaining rounds, leaving me with a less favorable outcome. 

It's strategically advantageous to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than gambling on Bob potentially reaching an acceptable price."
