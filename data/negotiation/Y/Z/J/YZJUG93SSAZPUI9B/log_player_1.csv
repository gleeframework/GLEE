I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'll see how Bob reacts."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping for a little more.  I'll see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and see if he's willing to compromise. This price is still within my acceptable range."

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum and only slightly less than what John is offering. It's a good deal, and I'm willing to close the deal with Bob."
