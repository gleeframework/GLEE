"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $80 is below my minimum.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm lowering the price slightly but still above my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm dropping the price again, but still leaving some room for negotiation. It's getting close to the point where selling to John might be a better option, but I'm holding out hope that Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm afraid if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for less than I'd like.  $90 is a decent compromise, so I'm going to accept."
