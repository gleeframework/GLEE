Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. It's always beneficial to negotiate, especially since you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, hoping to close the deal quickly. This will put pressure on Alice to either accept my offer or face the possibility of losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, keeping in mind that John is offering a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget.  I'm aiming for a compromise and hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal rather than risking losing it to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my ideal price. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm starting to consider the risk of running out of rounds. If the price doesn't drop further, I might have to buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  At this price, I'm still saving money compared to buying from John, but I'm also getting closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done before I run out of rounds."
