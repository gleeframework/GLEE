Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000.  While closer to your desired price, you can get the product for your ideal price from John. There's no need to negotiate further with Alice and risk paying more."
