"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $980,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",980000.0,Bob,4,
