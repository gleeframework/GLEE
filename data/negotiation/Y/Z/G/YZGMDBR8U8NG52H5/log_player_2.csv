# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.
