"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product worth at least $1,000,000 to you!  My asking price is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's make a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll gain from this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'll gain from this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. We're getting closer, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a final compromise on my part, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
