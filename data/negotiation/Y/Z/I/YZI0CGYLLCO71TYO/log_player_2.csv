"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $180 is way over his budget. He can get the same product from John for $100, so there's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $140 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $100.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $130 is getting closer to his budget, it's still $30 more than he can get the product for from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125.  Is that something you can work with?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer it to you for $127.50. This is my final concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer is $127.50, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's already had 6 rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice will go any lower.  It's better to get the product from John at the guaranteed price of $100."
