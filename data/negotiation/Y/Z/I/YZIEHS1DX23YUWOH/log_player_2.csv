"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob can likely get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your candor, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional item. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's ideal price point, but it's getting closer.  Bob still has room to negotiate and can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining."
