"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider this price?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that the product is worth it, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll propose $132.50. Can you consider this price?",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $132.50, which would be $136.25. I'm getting a bit concerned that if we don't meet at this price, I might have to consider other offers. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",136.25,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $136.25 and $132.50, which would be $134.375. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",134.375,Bob,8,
