{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price enticing.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You earn a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **If Bob rejects:** You still have the security of selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
