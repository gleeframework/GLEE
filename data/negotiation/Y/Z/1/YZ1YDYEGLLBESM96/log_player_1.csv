Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm indicating flexibility to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to gauge his interest and potential value.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness, hinting at potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still fall back on John's offer of $15,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while maintaining a willingness to negotiate and explore Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low to leave money on the table. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, and even if he doesn't, I'll still have the option to sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $15,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This would still be a great deal for you considering the unique value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's in between my initial offer and his. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Reiterate the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique benefits to emphasize its worth.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage acceptance.

This counteroffer aims to balance securing a better price than Bob's initial offer while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, it's more worthwhile to accept his offer than risk further negotiation. 

Here's why:

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and effort.  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, it's not worth the potential delay.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a reasonable price.
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is my safety net. I'm not losing out by accepting Bob's offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
