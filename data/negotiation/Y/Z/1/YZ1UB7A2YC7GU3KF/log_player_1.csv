Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage in the process rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Protecting my minimum:** By setting a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, I ensure that I will still make a decent profit even if I have to negotiate lower.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely watch Bob's reaction and be prepared to either negotiate further or accept his counteroffer if it's close to my desired price. If the negotiation drags on or if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I will switch to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a price closer to $10,500. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a profit margin. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will reconsider selling to John based on the situation and Bob's counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm lowering my price to $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining profit:**  $10,500 is still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 and well above my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, so I'm still making a decent profit.
* **Pressuring Bob:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm putting the ball back in Bob's court, giving him the chance to either accept this offer or risk losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully assess Bob's response. If he accepts my counteroffer, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. I'll consider factors like how determined Bob seems to be and how much time I want to spend negotiating."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is stalled:** Bob has rejected two of my offers, indicating he is not willing to negotiate much higher. 
* **Time is valuable:** I don't want to waste more time trying to get a better price from Bob.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me the full $12,000, ensuring I get the best possible outcome.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to settle for an offer that's significantly below my minimum. Selling to John guarantees my desired profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
