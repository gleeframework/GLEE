"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can bring you significant value. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price lower than its true worth, and I get a fair price for something that's very valuable to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
