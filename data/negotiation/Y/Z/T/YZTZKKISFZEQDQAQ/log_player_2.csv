# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be highly beneficial to your operations. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is too high. It is worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is still too high, but it is closer to what I am willing to pay. I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, but $950,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product and will allow us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is now at the same price as John's offer.  Since it's a fair price and I can close the deal now, it makes sense to go with John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept my next counteroffer."
