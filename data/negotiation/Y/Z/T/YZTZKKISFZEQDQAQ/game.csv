"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be highly beneficial to your operations. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for this valuable product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $950,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product and will allow us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
