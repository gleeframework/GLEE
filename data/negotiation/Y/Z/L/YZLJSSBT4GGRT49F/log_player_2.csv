"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $135. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $135 is lower than her product's value to her, you can get the product for a better price ($120) from John. Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that."
