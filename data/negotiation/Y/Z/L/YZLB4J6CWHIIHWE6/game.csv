"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I've done some research and found that similar products are available at lower prices. I'm still interested in purchasing this product, but I believe $10,000 is a fair price given its value. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're finding different price points out there, but I'm confident those don't offer the same value proposition this product does. I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,500, but that's my absolute lowest. This is a great deal for a product of this caliber.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. After careful consideration, I'd like to offer $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
