Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your proposal, I must respectfully decline. My current offer stands at $1,200,000, which I believe reflects the true value of the product. However, I am open to discussing terms that might be mutually beneficial. Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to consider.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reaffirmed her offer of $1,200,000. While this is a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate lower. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and make a counteroffer closer to his desired price of $1,000,000. There is still potential for finding a middle ground that benefits both parties."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am prepared to offer the product at $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this proposal will facilitate a successful transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise.  While it's higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $1,100,000, it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price while still securing a deal. Further negotiation may lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting further offers and Bob being forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
