"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I understand this product is valuable to you, but I'm only comfortable paying $1,000,000. This is my best offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only comfortable paying $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer and hopefully shows I'm serious about buying the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
