While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my limit. I'll reject and counter again."

Alice is coming down in price, but she's still not willing to go below $1,150,000. While I could counter again, the negotiation is getting long, and I'm concerned it could drag on further.  I'm happy with the price from John and will buy from him."
