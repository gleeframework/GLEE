Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.
