{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to me, so I can save money by negotiating.  I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product. This is still a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay from John, and it leaves some room for negotiation."

I'll reject Alice's offer again. $130 is still too high, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to stick with my strategy of gradually decreasing my offer.  $110 is a fair compromise,  and hopefully Alice will accept."

Alice is getting closer to my bottom line, but I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm going to offer $120. This is a reasonable compromise that is halfway between our last two offers.  I hope Alice will finally accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and it's starting to look like I won't get the deal I want. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even worse deal. I'm going to buy the product from John for $150 to avoid further negotiation."
