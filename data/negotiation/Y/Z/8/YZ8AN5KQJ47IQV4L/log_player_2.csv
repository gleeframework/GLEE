# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $1,200,000 to you, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In light of this, I would like to offer a compromise at $1,075,000. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable margin while reflecting the value you place on the product. I look forward to your consideration.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,100,000. It's still a good deal for you as it's lower than your initial counteroffer of $1,050,000 and also lower than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking further negotiation."
