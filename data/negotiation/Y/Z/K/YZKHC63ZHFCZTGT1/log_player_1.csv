"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's still within Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing goodwill:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage a positive response.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in on the first offer, as that could be seen as aggressive and lead to an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's clear he's willing to negotiate.  
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain my leverage and potentially drive the price higher. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm still emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob to make my counteroffer more appealing.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,050,000 yet, as I want to keep some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and constructive tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product, which I believe is fair given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is now willing to pay that.
* **Time is a factor:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting closer to the point where I might have to sell to John if I keep rejecting offers.
* **Risk of escalation:** Further negotiation might result in Bob's offer dropping back below my minimum, or I might have to accept John's offer, which would earn me less. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum and avoids the risk of a lower offer or having to sell to John."
