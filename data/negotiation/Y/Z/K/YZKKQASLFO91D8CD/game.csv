"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about $80? That's my absolute top limit, and it's the same price I can get from John. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,4,
