"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to purchase the product for $900000,  a price that is still fair given its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1050000, a price that reflects the product's unique value and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is fair given the value of the product.  Let's make a deal at this price and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
