Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $15,000 offer represents a 50% markup, which is significant but not unreasonable if the product's value justifies it. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Offering Bob the ""first look"" could make him more inclined to accept a higher price.  

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't have significant time pressure to sell. If you need to sell quickly, a smaller markup might be more strategic."
