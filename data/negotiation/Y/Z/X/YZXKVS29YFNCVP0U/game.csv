"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1500000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1650000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while still being within your budget. What are your thoughts?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet the proposed price of $1650000. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. I hope this helps us move closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm proposing a price of $1680000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I am still working within a strict budget. I would like to propose a price of $1620000. I hope this offer is acceptable and brings us closer to closing the deal.",1620000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're working within a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1620000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me, but I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1700000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this point. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1700000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1680000 is no longer on the table, but I'll meet you at $1690000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1690000.0,Alice,9,
