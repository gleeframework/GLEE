"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. This is the best I can do while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. Let me know if this works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $130.  This would allow me to make the purchase while still ensuring a fair deal for you.",130.0,Bob,4,
