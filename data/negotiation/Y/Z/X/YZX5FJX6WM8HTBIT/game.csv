Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,999000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $925000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet at $850000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your limitations, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to go up to $850000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'll counteroffer at $900000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering selling to John at $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're getting close to selling to John, but I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll meet you at $875000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $875000. I've already told you I'm close to selling to John at $1000000, and I'm not willing to give up that opportunity. I'll counteroffer at $950000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll sell to John.",950000.0,Alice,7,
