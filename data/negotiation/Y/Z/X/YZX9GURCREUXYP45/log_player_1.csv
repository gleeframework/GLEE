Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you could offer the product for $150 (its value to you), there's a chance Bob might reject it. By offering it slightly lower, you increase the likelihood of a sale and still make a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $140 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum price."
