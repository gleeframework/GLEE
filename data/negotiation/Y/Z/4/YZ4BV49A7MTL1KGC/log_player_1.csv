Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I've priced it at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. However, it's important to be aware of the potential risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still potential to get closer to my initial price of $20,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a better price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000, and it's within a reasonable range of my desired price.  I'll accept this offer."
