"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  I believe $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Would you consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I value your willingness to negotiate. To reach a final agreement, I'd be willing to accept $887,500.  This reflects my desire to make a deal but also recognizes the product's worth.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept $887,500. I'd be willing to go up to $882,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",882500.0,Bob,6,
