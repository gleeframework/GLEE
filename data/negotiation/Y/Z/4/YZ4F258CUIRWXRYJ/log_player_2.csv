"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $110. It's a great deal for a product you'll value highly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to start significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Low:**  Offering $90 is still a decent profit margin for Alice (considering her value is $80) and gives us a good starting point to bargain upwards. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message aims to keep the negotiation friendly and open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than the initial offer, we're still aiming to get closer to $90.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so we'll push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for somewhere around $100, Alice. Could you maybe do $95? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  We're meeting Alice halfway between her offer ($100) and our previous offer ($90).
* **Direct and Reasonable:** The message clearly states our desired price while acknowledging Alice's position.
* **Leaving Room:**  While we're aiming for $95, we're still leaving some room for Alice to potentially counter if she's absolutely unwilling to go that low."
