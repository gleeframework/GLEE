"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so he should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the first offer is a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for further rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and counteroffering again shows persistence and the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This counteroffer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. If Alice accepts, Bob achieves his goal. If Alice rejects, he can confidently move to buy the product from John in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than Bob's maximum price. Since there are only a few rounds left, and Bob has a guaranteed way to get the product for his desired price, he should take the safe option and buy from John. This avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures he gets the product for his maximum budget."
