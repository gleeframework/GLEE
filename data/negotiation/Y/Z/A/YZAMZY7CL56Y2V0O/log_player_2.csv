# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for both of us. This product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I propose to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This offer not only allows you to secure this valuable asset at a competitive price but also ensures a significant return on investment for me. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might incentivize her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
