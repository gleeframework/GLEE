Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, but I can still potentially get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low. It's not even covering my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $11500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $11,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? That's a good deal for both of us, and it would be a waste to lose this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to get as close to my target as possible. I'd be willing to go up to $12000, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price, but I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiations, and it seems he is not willing to go any higher. At this point, it's safer to sell to John for $12,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
