Round 7

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to meet your maximum price.  She's holding out for a much higher price, even though you've signaled your absolute limit.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the price you've established as your walk-away point."
