"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $90 at this time.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. That's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal. ",100.0,Alice,5,
