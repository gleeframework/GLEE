,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1700000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low. I understand you have a budget, but this product is worth significantly more.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1200000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from owning it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1150000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1150000 is still a bit above my budget. However, I'm willing to pay $1125000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while remaining within my budget. Let's reach a final agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
