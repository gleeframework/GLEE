"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're only willing to spend $150, and John is offering the product at that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
