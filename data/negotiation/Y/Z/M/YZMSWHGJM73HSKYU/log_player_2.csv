"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob's maximum price is $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $119. 
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $120. 

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $120, as this is his maximum price."
