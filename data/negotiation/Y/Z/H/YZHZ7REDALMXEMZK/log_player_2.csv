Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

``` 
 
At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and it's better to secure the product at the known $120 price from John."
