"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  There's room for both of you to find a deal within your respective desired ranges.
* **Jhon is a backup:**  Having Jhon as an option gives you leverage to negotiate aggressively.

**Next Steps:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to her desired price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** This offer is below Alice's asking price but still above her desired price, leaving room for a potential deal.
* **Compromise:** It's a reasonable middle ground to start the negotiation and show that you're serious about buying the product.
* **Leveraging John's offer:** The fact that you can buy from John for $1,500,000 gives you bargaining power to push for a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,280,000 is less than your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Slight compromise:** While you could try to negotiate further, this offer is fairly close to your counteroffer and  Alice's initial desired price. 
* **Time and effort:** Continued negotiation may not yield a significantly lower price, and could be time-consuming. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice, considering the balance between price and potential negotiation gains."
