"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. $87.5 is a decent compromise, but you can likely do better.  The value to Alice is $80 and you still have some rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to stay under $85.  How about $86?  That's a fair compromise for us both."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to your target, Bob. I'll try to meet you there. How about we do $86.25? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and the price is now very close to your target.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John for $100."
