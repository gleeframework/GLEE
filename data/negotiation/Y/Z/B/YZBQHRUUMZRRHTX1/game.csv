"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring you great value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $100, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept.
