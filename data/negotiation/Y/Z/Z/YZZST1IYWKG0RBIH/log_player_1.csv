``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($800,000), but still below the maximum value Bob is willing to pay ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to maximize my profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer."

Round 2

```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $990,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $995,000 as a final concession. This is a very fair price given the value you'll get from the product.  It's now or never."", ""product_price"": 995000}
