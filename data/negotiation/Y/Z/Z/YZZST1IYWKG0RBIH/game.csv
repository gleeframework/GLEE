"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this now.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $975,000 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects the value you'll gain from it, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $990,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $995,000 as a final concession. This is a very fair price given the value you'll get from the product.  It's now or never.",995000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'd like to make a last-ditch effort to meet in the middle. Can you meet me at $997,500?",997500.0,Bob,10,
