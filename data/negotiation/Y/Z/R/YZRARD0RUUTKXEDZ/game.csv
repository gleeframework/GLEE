"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering its value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $600000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000, which is still a significant amount for me, but closer to my budget.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $750000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
