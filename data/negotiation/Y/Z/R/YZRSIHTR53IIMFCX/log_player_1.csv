"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to me, subtly implying that I won't go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if this price works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
