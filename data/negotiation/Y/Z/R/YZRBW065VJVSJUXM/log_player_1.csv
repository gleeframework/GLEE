"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, but I won't go below my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob values the product higher than $15,000, and this counteroffer shows I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids risking a lower offer in subsequent rounds."
