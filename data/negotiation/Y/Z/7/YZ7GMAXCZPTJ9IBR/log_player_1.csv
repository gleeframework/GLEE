"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds we have left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a good deal, and I respect that. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $10,875.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10875}
