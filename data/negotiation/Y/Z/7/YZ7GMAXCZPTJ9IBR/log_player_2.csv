Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That gives us both a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a good deal, and I respect that. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $10,875.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but seems unlikely to go much lower than $10,875. Accepting this offer secures a price significantly lower than John's $12,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
