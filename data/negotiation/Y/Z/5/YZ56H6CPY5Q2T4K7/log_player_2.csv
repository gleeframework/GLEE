"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is already willing to sell the product for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product at your target price immediately from John."
