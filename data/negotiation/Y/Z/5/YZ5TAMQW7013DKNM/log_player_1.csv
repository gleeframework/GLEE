"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals a willingness to compromise and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I need to hold out for a better price.  I'll counter with a lower offer than my initial proposal, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This still reflects the value of the product to you, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable.  I'm not going to settle for a deal that's significantly below my minimum price. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer, but still higher than his."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $10,000 to sweeten the deal. I'll pay $1,160,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to accept Bob's offer, his added $10,000 sweetener is negligible.  I'm still far from my minimum price and I need to push for a better deal.  I'll counter with a price higher than his offer, but still below my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,160,000 is still significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
