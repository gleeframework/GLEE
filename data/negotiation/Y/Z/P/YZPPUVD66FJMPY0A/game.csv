"Alice, your product seems great, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer you a compromise at $135. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125?  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. However, $125 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I can offer you a slight adjustment at $140. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",140.0,Alice,5,
