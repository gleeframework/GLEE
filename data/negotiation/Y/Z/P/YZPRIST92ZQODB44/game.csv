"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  I'm really keen on this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I have to say that 100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at 110? I'm confident you'll find the product worth the value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's try to close this deal,  I'm confident this product will be worth it for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below 115. How about we meet in the middle again at 110.5? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",110.5,Alice,5,
