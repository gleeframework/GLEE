"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  I'm really keen on this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I have to say that 100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at 110? I'm confident you'll find the product worth the value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to continue the process and try to get a better price.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your $100 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's try to close this deal,  I'm confident this product will be worth it for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below 115. How about we meet in the middle again at 110.5? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110.5 is very close to my counteroffer of $105. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially increasing her price is too high. I'm confident that I've gotten a good deal and saved some money."
