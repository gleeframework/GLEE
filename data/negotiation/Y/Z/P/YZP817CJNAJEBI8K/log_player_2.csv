"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'll meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer you a price of $7,800. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice seems quite firm on not going below $7,800.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge and I'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John at $10,000. $7,800 is a reasonable price and a good compromise."
