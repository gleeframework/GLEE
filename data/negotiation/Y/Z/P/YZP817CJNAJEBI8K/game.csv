"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $8,200. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer you a price of $7,900. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I can tell we both want to make a deal here.  How about $7,700?  That's a strong offer and gets us very close to meeting in the middle.",7700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'll meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer you a price of $7,800. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7800.0,Alice,7,
