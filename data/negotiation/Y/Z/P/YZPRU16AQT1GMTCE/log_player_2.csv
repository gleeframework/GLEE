"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's much more beneficial to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to find a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting at his maximum budget of $8,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer as it makes Bob's intentions clear while leaving some room for negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. He has several rounds left and should continue to negotiate for a better price.  There's no need to rush into an agreement that's still too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but it's still well within his budget and significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but also sets a clear limit.  It's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, $17,000 is still too high.  Bob has several rounds remaining to negotiate, and it's more beneficial to continue pushing for a lower price.  He can still get the product from John for $8,000 if he's unable to reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, increasing his offer to $12,000. This is still a considerable discount from Alice's last offer, but it demonstrates that he's actively participating in the negotiation and is serious about reaching a deal.  There are still several rounds left, so it's a calculated risk to see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has lowered her price again, $16,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has only three rounds left, but he's still in a strong position. He can still get the product from John for $8,000, so there's no urgency to accept a price that's higher than his budget. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but also sets a clear limit. He's approaching his limit, but there's still room to negotiate.  There are only two rounds left, so this is a strong attempt to get Alice closer to his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above Bob's budget.  He has only one round left to negotiate. Since he can still get the product from John for $8,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice. He has nothing to lose by holding out for a better price, and there's a chance Alice might make a final concession to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer. He is increasing his offer to $15,000, which is a significant compromise from his initial offer of $8,000 but still represents a considerable discount from Alice's last offer of $16,000. With only one round remaining, this is a strong attempt to reach a deal. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will buy the product from John for $8,000, as he is unwilling to go higher.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is also firm on his budget constraints."
