Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still keeping you well above your minimum selling price. 
* **Confidence and Justification:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""given its value"" project confidence and subtly remind Bob of the product's worth.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John, maximizing your potential profit."
