Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a much larger profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential."" This subtly suggests the price is justified without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion (""Let me know your thoughts""). This invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high, keeping the negotiation door open.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's position as a desirable buyer."
