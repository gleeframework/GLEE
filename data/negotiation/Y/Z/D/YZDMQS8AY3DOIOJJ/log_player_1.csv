"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the full price of $1,200,000. I know this is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but I want to see if he's willing to pay my minimum. If he rejects, I'll have to consider dropping the price, but for now, I'm aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum and I know I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still above Bob's maximum, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping that this will show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's slightly higher than his previous offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still above Bob's maximum, but it's getting closer to his valuation.  I'm hoping this will entice him to come closer to my minimum price and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While it's getting closer,  I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

This time I'm going to counter with $1,020,000. This is just a little bit more than Bob's last offer and much closer to my minimum. I think this could be the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit below my minimum price. I am almost at the point of selling to John, but I will give Bob one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum price and it's right at his valuation. I believe it's the best possible outcome for both of us. If he rejects it, I'll move on and sell to John."
