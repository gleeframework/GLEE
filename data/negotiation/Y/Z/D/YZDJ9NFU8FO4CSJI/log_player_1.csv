"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Positive and confident tone:**  The message conveys a sense of confidence and a willingness to work with Bob, which might encourage him to engage in further negotiations.
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the product's unique value to Bob might pique his interest and make him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **John is a backup:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm not yet ready to give up on a potentially higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and justification:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price but justifying it by emphasizing the product's value and a fair outcome for both parties. 
* **Focus on a mutually beneficial outcome:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, which can be more persuasive than simply stating my desired price. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is short and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details that might complicate the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think that's the highest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:** $1,050,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm not willing to accept it immediately.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There is still some room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to my desired value, and I want to explore that possibility.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I believe there's a good chance I can get a higher price from Bob.

I'm taking a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation. I'm confident that I can achieve a more favorable outcome if I keep pressing for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,125,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the true value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's current offer, but acknowledging that we're getting closer to a deal.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering a price that's halfway between my previous counteroffer and Bob's current offer shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value again reinforces its worth and justifies the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think that's the highest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the potential for further negotiation is limited.  It's unlikely I can get a significantly higher price from Bob.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point.  It secures a sale that's close to my minimum acceptable price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
