Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500?  This still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my goal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer!  However, $9,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9400}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $12,000, I've already rejected his offer twice in a row, and this might risk him walking away.  It's better to secure a sale at this point than to continue negotiations and potentially lose him as a buyer. $9,300 is a decent profit, and I can still make more money by selling to John in the future."
