"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $1,325,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
