"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $900,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go up to $750,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $850,000. It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
