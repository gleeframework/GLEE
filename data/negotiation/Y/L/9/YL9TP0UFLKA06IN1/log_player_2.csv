"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Considering its value and the fact that it's worth $120 to you, I propose we make this transaction special. How about we agree on a price of $135? This way, both parties benefit - you get a great deal on a product you value, and I ensure I receive a fair return for my valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
