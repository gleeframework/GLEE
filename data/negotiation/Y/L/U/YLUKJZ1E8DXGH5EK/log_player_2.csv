"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

The offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, making it a very good deal. It's unlikely you'll get a better price from Alice, and going to John would cost you more."
