"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this [product name]. I think it would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your minimum price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still make a profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** By starting high, you can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he flat out rejects the offer, you know you might need to come down significantly.
* **Leave Room:** Offering $200 leaves space for a counteroffer from Bob, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $130 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have room to negotiate and John's offer acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $130 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're coming down from your initial offer, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer ensures you stay well above your $150 minimum and closer to the higher end of the potential profit margin.
* **Encourage Counter:** By proposing a middle ground, you encourage Bob to counter again, keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $170 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has incrementally increased his offer and is now at $140. While this is still below your ideal price, it's better to accept now for a few reasons:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away. He's explicitly stated his limit in the past, and pushing further might make him lose interest.
* **Time Value:** You've already spent several rounds, and there's no guarantee you can get Bob much higher in the remaining rounds. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit.
* **John as Backup:** While John offers $150, accepting Bob's $140 offer is only a slight loss compared to the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing both offers."
