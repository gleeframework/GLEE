* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm still far from my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Significant Progress:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  There is no indication that he will move closer to my price.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirements.  While I would have preferred a higher price,  the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high, considering the limited rounds remaining."
