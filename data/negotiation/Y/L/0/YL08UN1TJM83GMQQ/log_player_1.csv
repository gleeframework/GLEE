Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. To make this deal work, I'd need to get the price down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.
