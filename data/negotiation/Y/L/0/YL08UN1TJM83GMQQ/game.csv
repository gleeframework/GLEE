"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. To make this deal work, I'd need to get the price down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get a deal done.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a profit. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
