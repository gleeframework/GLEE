Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs to make at least $800,000 (John's offer). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, Alice should aim for a price significantly higher than her minimum, but still lower than Bob's valuation. 
* **Negotiating Room:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
