"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I agree this product has great potential. I'm interested, but the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $600,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. Considering your enthusiasm, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I can do $675,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $675,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $637,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",637500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $637,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get the deal done. I can do $650,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still a discount from my initial price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for us both.  How about we split the difference again and land at $643,750? I think that's a fair deal for everyone.",643750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $643,750 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make another concession to get the deal done. I can do $640,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still a discount from my initial price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.
