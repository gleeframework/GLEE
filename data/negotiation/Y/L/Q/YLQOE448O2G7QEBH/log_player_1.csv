{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product more than you do.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range very profitable for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a solid backup plan with John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
