"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $60 is low, but $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle on $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need the price to come down a bit more. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
