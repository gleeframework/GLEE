"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested but doesn't want to pay the full asking price.  It also provides a buffer in case Bob makes a low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a little more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It also keeps a bit of a buffer in case I need to make further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $135,  it's only $5 less than my counteroffer, and I'm concerned that I may not get a better offer from him.  Also, with John as an alternative buyer, I'm not in a position to be overly demanding."
