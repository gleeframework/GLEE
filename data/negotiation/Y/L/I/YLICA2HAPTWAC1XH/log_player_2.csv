"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  Even though Alice is offering a price below the product's worth to Bob, it's still above his maximum budget.  He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial asking price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit.

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice is willing to come down to $1,320,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point and John is offering the product at Bob's target price.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice, as Bob can get the product at a lower price from John."
