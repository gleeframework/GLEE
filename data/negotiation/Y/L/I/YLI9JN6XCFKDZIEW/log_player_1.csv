Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit margin. 

It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob. By starting with a lower price, I encourage Bob to engage in negotiation and potentially increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than the value of the product to him ($8,000).  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. 

Instead, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will make a counteroffer. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.  I am also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $8,500 but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This also leaves me with a healthy profit margin. 

My hope is that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. If he doesn't, I can still walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than the value of the product to me.  Furthermore, I know that I can sell the product to John for $15,000, guaranteeing a much higher profit. 

Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John. This ensures that I achieve my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my expectations."
