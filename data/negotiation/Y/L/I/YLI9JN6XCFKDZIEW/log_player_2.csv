"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for Bob.
* Bob has a better option of buying from John for $8,000.
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget of $8,000 as possible.
* Offering $8,500 represents a significant discount from Alice's offer of $13,000 and leaves room for further negotiation.
* This counteroffer is still below the value Alice places on the product ($15,000), potentially making it appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still potential to negotiate further.
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price. If negotiations fail, he can still purchase the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Bob wants to stay below his $8,000 limit, but also needs to offer something Alice might accept.
*  $9,500 is a compromise, offering a decent discount from Alice's $11,000 offer, while still being within a reasonable range for Alice, who values the product at $15,000. 
*  This counteroffer increases the likelihood of a deal while maintaining the possibility of a further discount."
