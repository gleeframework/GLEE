"Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $12,000 right now. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to facilitate this deal. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my absolute lowest price, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and its potential benefits for you. Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
