Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum.  This is a tactic to see if I can get a higher price without immediately going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly lower than what John is willing to pay, but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear floor for my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum, and while I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing too much time. John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum, so I'll go with that."
