"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the [product name], $200 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is a fair price considering the value of the [product name].  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $175 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you could potentially save some money by making another counteroffer."
