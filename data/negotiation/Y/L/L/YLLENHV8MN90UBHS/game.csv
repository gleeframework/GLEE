"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14250?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $13750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again and go with $14000.  I think this price is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
