Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $12000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $15000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my preferred price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,250?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14250 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $13750.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to an agreement.  Bob's offer is getting better, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again and go with $14,000.  I think this price is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13800.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is now only $200 lower than my last counteroffer. While I'd like to get closer to $14,000, it's unlikely that Bob will budge much further. Accepting his offer now guarantees a sale at a price significantly higher than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of the negotiation failing completely."
