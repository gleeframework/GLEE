{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Giving Bob some room to negotiate will make him more likely to engage.
* **Is lower than your minimum value:** It gives you some room to lower the price if needed, while still securing a profit.

I'll keep in mind the potential sale to John at $1,500,000, so I won't drop my price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that will hopefully bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above my minimum value:** I'm making a concession, but not sacrificing too much.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer:**  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in completely. 

I'm hoping this offer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1300000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it's the best way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,300,000, which is just below my minimum but still a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating.  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or that I'll lose out on the opportunity to sell to John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
