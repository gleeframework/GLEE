Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer.  This means you shouldn't sell to Bob for anything less than $1,500,000. However, there's a chance to negotiate a higher price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for a price of $1,650,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but not exorbitantly so.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique value and potential,"" you're framing the product as something worth paying a premium for.
* **Leaving Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  Be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your price. You have a guaranteed sale with John at your minimum acceptable price."
