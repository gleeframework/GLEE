"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $14,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would make this deal truly beneficial."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's $15,000.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and the deal might fall apart.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price without taking unnecessary risks."
