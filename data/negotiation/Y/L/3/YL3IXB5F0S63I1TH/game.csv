"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is well above my budget.  Given my research and the market value, I'm comfortable offering $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably commit to.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
