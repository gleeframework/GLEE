"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and there's potential to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though - I'll sell it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, $825,000 is a good price for Bob.  He's already made significant progress in negotiating down from Alice's initial price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly lower price.  It's also worth remembering that buying from John would cost $1,200,000."
