"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $12,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than your estimated value. Let's close this deal and both be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,750 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer of $9,500.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price without further negotiation."
