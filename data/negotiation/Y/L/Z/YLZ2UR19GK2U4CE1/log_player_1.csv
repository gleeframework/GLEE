As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me and your potential profit. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.
