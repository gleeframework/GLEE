"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me and your potential profit. I believe this is a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $975,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also giving you a good deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000 yet. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a revised price of $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
