"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this amazing product to you. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and John is willing to sell the product for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the product at the desired price point."
