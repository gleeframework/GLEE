"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're willing to pay, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
