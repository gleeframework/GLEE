"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my operations. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,600,000 is a significant sum, I'm confident this product's true value is considerably higher, especially considering the potential benefits it offers your operations. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This reflects the value I know it holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still looking to stay within a specific budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to my operations. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
