"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as it's the same price."
