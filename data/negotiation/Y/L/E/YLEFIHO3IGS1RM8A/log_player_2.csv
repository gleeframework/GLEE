"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, you can still do better. You're willing to pay up to $8,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $10,000, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this offer is reasonable given my willingness to pay up to $8,000 and Alice's desire to sell the product for more than $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is only $500 more than my maximum price of $8,000.  It's worth accepting this offer as it's closer to my desired price and avoids any further negotiation.  While I could try to bargain further, it's not guaranteed that Alice will budge again, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
