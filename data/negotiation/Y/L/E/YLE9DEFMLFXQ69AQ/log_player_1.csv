``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $125 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we compromise at $130? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

While I'd prefer to get closer to $130,  Bob's offer of $127 is getting pretty close.  Considering we're down to the 6th round and John is waiting in the wings for $100, I'm going to accept this offer."
