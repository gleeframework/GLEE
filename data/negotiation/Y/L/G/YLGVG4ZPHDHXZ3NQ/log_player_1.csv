Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000.  I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, bringing us closer to our desired profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $15,000. This means we don't need to go below our minimum price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we don't have time constraints. If we need to sell the product quickly, we might lower the price to ensure a faster sale.
* We don't know Bob's negotiation style.  If he's known to be a tough negotiator, we might start with a slightly higher price."
