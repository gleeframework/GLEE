Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to sell it for at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a higher price ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can potentially still secure a price higher than your guaranteed $8,000 from John. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response!"
