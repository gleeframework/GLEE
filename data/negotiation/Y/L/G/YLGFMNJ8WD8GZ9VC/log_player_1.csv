"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would allow us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
