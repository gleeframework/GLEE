"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I'm willing to make an exception for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $850,000 is still a bit too high.  Would you be willing to consider $775,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
