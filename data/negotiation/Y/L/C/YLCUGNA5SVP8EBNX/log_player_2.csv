"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this exceptional product, Bob. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice is employing some sales tactics by implying a higher value to you, $1,100,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000."
