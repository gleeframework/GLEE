"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $10,000, so this is a significant jump, but I'm hoping to leverage my position and see if I can get him to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is a bit too low for me, considering my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,000.  This is still a good profit margin for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value,  $13,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum value of $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. It's a win-win situation, and I'm hopeful Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I've reached a point where I'm not confident he'll meet my minimum value. John is offering my minimum, and it's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale."
