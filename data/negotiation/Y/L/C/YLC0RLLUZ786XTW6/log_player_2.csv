"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make a deal at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Would you be willing to let it go for $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer starts with a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation while still showing interest in the product. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $110 is still a good deal for me. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a lower price than John's and allows me to avoid further negotiation rounds."
