"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $950,000, which is still a great deal for you. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of meeting in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $925,000. I can do $920,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
