,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $130 is a bit more than I was hoping for. How about $115?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $122.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $122.50 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $120.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to keep it within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
