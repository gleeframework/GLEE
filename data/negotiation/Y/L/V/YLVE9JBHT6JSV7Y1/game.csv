"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, but $900,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
