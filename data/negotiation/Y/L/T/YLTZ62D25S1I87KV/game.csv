"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
