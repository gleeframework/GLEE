"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so I'm thinking $12,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
