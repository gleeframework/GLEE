"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could you do $70? That would really help me out.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate that. But $70 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $75. This is the final price I'm willing to go down to.",75.0,Alice,5,
