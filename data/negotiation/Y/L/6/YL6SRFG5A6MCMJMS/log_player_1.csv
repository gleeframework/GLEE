Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,""  Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding. Phrasing like ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Aiming high with Bob is the best strategy, even if it means a slightly higher risk of him rejecting the offer."
