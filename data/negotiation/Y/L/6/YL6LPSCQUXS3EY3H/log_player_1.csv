Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."

I'll accept Bob's offer for $1,300,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial valuation, I'm running out of rounds and this offer is still significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
