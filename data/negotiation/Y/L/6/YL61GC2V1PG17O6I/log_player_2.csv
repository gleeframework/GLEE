"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. My starting price is $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $100. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $110? That's still a great price for this product, and it's closer to what I need to get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than Alice's minimum value. There's still room for negotiation to get a lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $108.50? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $108.5 is within Bob's budget of $120, making it a financially viable option. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and this offer is closer to Bob's ideal price than previous offers.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures the product and avoids the risk of losing the deal to another seller."
