"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening Offer:**  Starting with a high price allows for room to negotiate. It also signals the product's value and sets a strong starting point.
* **Positive and Open Message:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to consider the offer.  It highlights the potential benefits of the product. 

**Note:** This is just the first offer. As the negotiation progresses, I will adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and try to maximize my profit while considering the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.**  
* **I have 9 rounds remaining to negotiate a better price.**  While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth losing the potential for a higher offer. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $800,000, which is still within my minimum acceptable price.** However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, it's significantly lower than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within Range:**  The offer of $850,000 is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my value perception.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the product's value and emphasizes the compromise. It avoids harsh rejection and keeps the negotiation open.
* **Opportunity for Agreement:**  By reducing the price, I am giving Bob a better chance to accept. This increases the likelihood of a deal and helps me avoid selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Significant gap:**  The gap between our positions is still too large. 
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:** Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed deal at my minimum acceptable price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap, but I am increasingly concerned that Bob's offer is not going to meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $775,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to find common ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous one.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** The message reiterates that this is a compromise and focuses on finding common ground. 
* **Increasing Pressure:**  I'm running out of time, so this offer increases the pressure on Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'm closer to accepting John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely move closer to accepting John's offer, as the time constraint is becoming a factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $750000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a better deal is increasing.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:**  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap, but I am seriously considering accepting John's offer if Bob rejects this final attempt."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we may be too far apart. While I'm still interested in working with you, $750,000 is simply not enough for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. My absolute lowest price is $790,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope you'll reconsider. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my last counteroffer, signaling to Bob that I'm nearing the end of my negotiation tolerance. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I highlight that this price is a significant compromise on my part.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message implies that if Bob doesn't accept, I'll be forced to explore other options (meaning selling to John).
* **Close to Minimum:** While still $10,000 above my minimum, this offer is a significant move toward Bob's position.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this final offer, I will likely accept John's offer. The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $765000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the chance of getting a better offer from Bob is extremely low. 
* **Too Much Risk:**  Bob's offer is still $35,000 below my minimum acceptable price. The risk of getting a lower price or no deal at all is too high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a secure and satisfactory profit. 

**Conclusion:**

The negotiation with Bob has reached a point where the risk of continuing is greater than the potential reward. It's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit."
