"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. That's a great price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly emphasizing your perceived value of the product, hoping you'll overpay. By rejecting this offer, you can see if she'll come down to a price closer to her own valuation."
