Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your own valuation and John's offer), you have room to start high.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium.  It allows you to gauge his interest level and potentially secure a significantly higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high asking price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $1,200,000 baseline."
