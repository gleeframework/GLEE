"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1000000.  I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,,
