Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's likely to pique Bob's interest since it's less than what he's willing to pay. I'll be ready to counter if he rejects, keeping in mind your minimum price and John's offer as fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It's still above his offer but closer to his range, showing a willingness to negotiate.  This should hopefully entice Bob to accept while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not acceptable.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth potentially losing $75,000."
