Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $1,500,000 that Bob values it at, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong offer:**  $1,400,000 is a significant amount of money, showing Bob that you are serious about selling but also that you are not desperate. 

Remember, the key is to be flexible and willing to negotiate while keeping your bottom line in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good amount, it's still below what I'm aiming for. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle ground between my last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000).
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing that this price still gives Bob a good deal, considering he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Openness:** I'm ending with a message that suggests I'm open to further discussion and finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, $1,250,000 is still a good deal for me, especially considering:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm getting more than my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Bob is showing willingness to negotiate:** He's moving closer to my price, indicating he's genuinely interested.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation breaks down, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical choice at this point."
