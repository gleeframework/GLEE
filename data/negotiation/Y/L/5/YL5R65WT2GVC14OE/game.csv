"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14000, considering your budget constraints. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  I'm happy to continue negotiating and see if we can find common ground. How about $13500?  It's a compromise, but it's still a fair price given the unique value of this product. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
