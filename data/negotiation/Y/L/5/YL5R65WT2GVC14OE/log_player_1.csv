Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

I will reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than $10,000, I believe I can get a better price. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I am aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit above my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher value for the product. I have 6 rounds remaining and want to make a final push to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  I'm happy to continue negotiating and see if we can find common ground. How about $13,500?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, I've reached a point where I need to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's safer to accept $13,000 and secure the sale."
