"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $90? This is still a great deal, and I think we can find a win-win solution here.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more around $70. Would that be workable for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to my limit here, but I'm still open to negotiating. $70 is still too low for me, how about we settle on $85?  I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,6,
