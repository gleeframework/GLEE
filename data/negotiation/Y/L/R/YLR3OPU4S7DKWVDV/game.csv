"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $13000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm prepared to offer $14500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $17000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $15500?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm very close to my budget limit, and I'm only comfortable going up to $15200.  If you're willing to accept this final offer, we can close the deal.",15200.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $15200, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,7,
