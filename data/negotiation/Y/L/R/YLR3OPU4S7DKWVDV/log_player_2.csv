"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $18000 for it. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is over Bob's budget and he can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $13000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $16000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has room to negotiate.  He should reject and counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his $15,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm prepared to offer $14,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $17000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $15500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While this is getting closer to his goal, he can still try to negotiate further.  He's only $500 away from his target price with John, so it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm very close to my budget limit, and I'm only comfortable going up to $15,200.  If you're willing to accept this final offer, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $15200, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $16000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has offered $16,000 which is more than Bob's target price.  Even if Bob rejects, he can't be sure if he'll be able to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's better to go with the guaranteed $15,000 from John, as time is running out and Bob has reached his budget limit."
