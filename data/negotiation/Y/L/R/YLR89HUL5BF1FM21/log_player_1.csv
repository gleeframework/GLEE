Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation.  This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down, even if it's still above his initial valuation.
* **Value-Based Language:** The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" rather than just the price. This encourages Bob to consider potential benefits beyond his initial assessment. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes some willingness from Bob to negotiate. If you know he's extremely price-sensitive or dislikes back-and-forth, a lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Relationship Building:** Even if this deal falls through, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob could be valuable for future opportunities.  The message aims to be direct while remaining professional and amicable."
