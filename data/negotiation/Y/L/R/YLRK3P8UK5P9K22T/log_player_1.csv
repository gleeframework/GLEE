Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $9,500 for it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a strong starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is your minimum, you know the product is worth more to Bob.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile.  How about $8,500?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to consider $8,000 for the product? It's at the upper limit of what I can afford, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his $8,000 offer, and at this point, further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.  Since John is also willing to pay $8,000,  it's the most sensible option to sell to John and avoid further back-and-forth."
