"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  
* **Counteroffers are possible:**  You have the opportunity to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:**  You can always get the product from John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the initial offer, you can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your limit:** $9,000 is still above your ideal price of $8,000, but it's a significant drop from her previous offer of $9,500.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a higher price if Alice becomes unwilling to budge further.
* **Buying from John is still an option:** You can still buy from John for $10,000 if you're unhappy with the final price.

**Strategy:** Accepting this offer allows you to get the product for a reasonable price without risking a prolonged negotiation that might result in a worse outcome."
