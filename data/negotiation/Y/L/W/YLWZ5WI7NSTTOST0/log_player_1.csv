"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing my bottom line. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, which means there's potential for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can get a better price than $120 if I continue negotiating.  

I'm confident that I can achieve a higher price by strategically countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is exactly in the middle between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining my bottom line:** $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($150), ensuring I get a reasonable profit.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I use a friendly tone to keep the conversation positive and encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still achieving a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160, which would be $140. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer, I'm concerned that the negotiation might drag on and Bob might not be willing to go higher. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $150. 

Given the potential for a drawn-out negotiation and the risk of a lower price, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit."
