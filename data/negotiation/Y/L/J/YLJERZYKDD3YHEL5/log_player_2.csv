"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a price that's still below its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
