"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'd make a $1,000 profit, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
