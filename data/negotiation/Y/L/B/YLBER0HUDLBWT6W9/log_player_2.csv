"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'd make a $1,000 profit, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my original offer.  How about $12,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $12,000 is still within Bob's budget and saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or the negotiations will drag on, wasting time.

Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential complications of further negotiation."
