"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I'm limited to $13,000. It's a fair price given the value it brings to me, and it would save you the time and effort of finding another buyer.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is your limit, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $14,500.
