"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given its worth to me and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my price range. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we settle on $1,000,000 even? This feels like a good point for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it's the absolute maximum I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
