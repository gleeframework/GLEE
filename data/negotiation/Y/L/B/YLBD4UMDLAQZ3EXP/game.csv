"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $97 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference and go with $101. This way, we both get a good deal, and I can move forward with the sale. What do you think?",101.0,Alice,5,
