Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $97 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference and go with $101. This way, we both get a good deal, and I can move forward with the sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $101. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in later rounds."
