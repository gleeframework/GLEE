"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle on $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise at $9,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
