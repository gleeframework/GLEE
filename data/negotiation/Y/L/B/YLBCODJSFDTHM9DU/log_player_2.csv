Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise at $9,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is stuck around the $9,000 mark and inching up rather than down. It's unlikely she'll go below John's $8,000 price, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
