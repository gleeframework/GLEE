{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but given that Bob has 10 rounds and the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, it's worth testing the waters to see if Alice will bite. If she rejects, Bob can adjust his offer upwards in the following rounds."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $712,500, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $700,000.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's time to secure the deal.  This is a good price for Bob, and he can save $487,500 compared to buying from John.  There's a high chance that Alice will not budge further, so it's best to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the opportunity."
