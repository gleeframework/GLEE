"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:**  My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to sway him towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation of the product. I am willing to pay $1400000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to a deal that's more favorable to me. 
* **Potential for John:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to show my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my initial price to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the merit of a deal closer to my price.
* **Positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and optimistic, aiming to maintain a positive negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1550000. I hope this aligns better with the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not enough:** While Bob's offer is just $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There are still 6 rounds left in the negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can potentially get Bob to increase his offer further.
* **John is a backup:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be. To get this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000. This price reflects the unique value of this product, and it's a reasonable middle ground. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to show my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Small but significant compromise:** I'm reducing my previous offer by $25,000, showing a willingness to meet in the middle, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product and frame my counteroffer as a fair compromise.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1525000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a deal that satisfies my minimum price.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has come closer, his offer is still $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a successful transaction. It's more efficient than risking further negotiations with Bob."
