"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's a significant reduction from my initial price. Let's meet in the middle.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to cover your costs, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
