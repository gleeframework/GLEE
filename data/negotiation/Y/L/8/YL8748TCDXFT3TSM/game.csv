"Alice, your product sounds promising, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Considering its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This price would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit and me a substantial saving. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement, $1,100,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This reflects its significance while acknowledging your interest.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To get this deal done, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
