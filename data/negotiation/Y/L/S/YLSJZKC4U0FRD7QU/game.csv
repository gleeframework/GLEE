"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. While I understand your position, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Bob,4,
