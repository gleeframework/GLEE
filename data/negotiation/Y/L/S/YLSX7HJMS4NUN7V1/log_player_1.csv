Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Even though you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, it's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high starting price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** By framing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and asking for Bob's thoughts, you encourage him to engage in the negotiation process. This allows you to gauge his interest level and adjust your strategy accordingly. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Ideal scenario, you get more than your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price, potentially settling somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your $12,000."
