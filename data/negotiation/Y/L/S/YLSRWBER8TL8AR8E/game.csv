"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has value, Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I think the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, which would be $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
