This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to assess Bob's interest and potentially adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to avoid selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for a loss.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price that's more appealing to me, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,200?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which would be $9,000. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000 and avoids further negotiation."
