"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it's within my budget, I'm looking to get the best value for my money. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good price for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
