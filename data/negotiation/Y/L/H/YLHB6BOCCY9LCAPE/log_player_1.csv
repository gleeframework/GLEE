Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair offer considering the value it brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $812,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer. I'm confident I can get him closer to $900,000, especially since I have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $900,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Could we possibly agree on $850,000? I think that's a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While I believe the product is worth more, accepting $850,000 is a reasonable compromise at this stage. It's significantly more than Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of him walking away completely.  Continuing negotiations might lead to a slightly higher offer, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
