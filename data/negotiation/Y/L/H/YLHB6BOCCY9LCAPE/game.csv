"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm asking for $1,100,000 to start the conversation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $812,500?",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $900,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Could we possibly agree on $850,000? I think that's a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,6,
