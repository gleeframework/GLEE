"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the logical choice. You can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice, and if that fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's likely that Alice will counter back, but this initial offer establishes my negotiating position and shows that I am serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal. It's still significantly lower than John's price of $12,000, and it's likely that further negotiation would only result in a small reduction in price, if any.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
