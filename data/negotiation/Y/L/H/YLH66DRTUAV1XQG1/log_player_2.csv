"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value, Bob can likely get it for less. It's worth exploring further negotiation before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,500? I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still get a better price. It's worth negotiating further to see if he can get closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,000 as a compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's previous offer, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price, and if unsuccessful, he can always purchase from John for $8,000.  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is tempting, Bob can still try to get a lower price. He has 3 rounds left, and it's still worth pushing for a better deal. If he can't get it lower, he can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $10,375. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left. While $10,375 is a good price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's better to secure the product for $8,000 from John rather than risk getting a worse deal in the final round."
