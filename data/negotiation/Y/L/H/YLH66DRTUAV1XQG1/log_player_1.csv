Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately lose the deal.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is not too high, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer and allowing me to gauge his interest."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
