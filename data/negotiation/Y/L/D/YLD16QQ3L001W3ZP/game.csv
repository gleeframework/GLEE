"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50? I'm still motivated to sell to you, but I need to get a fair price for this product.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $95. I'm getting closer to your price, and I'm really interested in this product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $105? That's a significant step towards your offer, and it's a fair price for this fantastic product. I'm confident you won't regret it.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference at $98.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. But I'm not sure $98 is quite enough for me. Let's meet at $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to accepting, but I'm still a little over budget.  How about $99?  That's just a dollar away from your offer, and I really want this product.",99.0,Bob,8,
