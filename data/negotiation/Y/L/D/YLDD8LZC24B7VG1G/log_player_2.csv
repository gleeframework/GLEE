Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Alice has come down to her lowest price, which matches what you can get from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John since the price will be the same."
