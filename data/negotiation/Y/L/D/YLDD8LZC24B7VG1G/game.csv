"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Alice,5,
