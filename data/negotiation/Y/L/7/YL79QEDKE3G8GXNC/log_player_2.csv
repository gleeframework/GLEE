"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $13,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of them. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to negotiate a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Good:** Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal considering the product's value.
* **Potential for More Rounds:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's risky. Alice might reject and potentially raise the price, and there are only 7 rounds left.
* **Risk of Buying from John:** Buying from John is an option but would cost Bob $1,500 more than Alice's current offer.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. It ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and saves money compared to buying from John."
