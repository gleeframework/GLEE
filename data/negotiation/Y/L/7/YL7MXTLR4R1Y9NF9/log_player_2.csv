"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can definitely do better.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still above my target price. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This price reflects the value to me, while still leaving you a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her latest offer of $825,000 is very close to my target price of $800,000. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or a higher price.  While I could try for a lower price, it's likely Alice won't budge much further, and I could end up paying more or losing the deal entirely.  It's a good deal for both of us and I should take it."
