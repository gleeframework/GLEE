"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer above my minimum to leave room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room:**  The high starting price allows me to potentially decrease the price during counteroffers while still staying above my $15,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm better off rejecting and countering, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. I'm keeping John as a backup option if negotiations don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to find a price that works for us, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Counter:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by recognizing Bob's offer.
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly reiterating the product's value to justify my higher price without directly dismissing his offer.
* **Significant Drop:** The $3,000 decrease signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting his offer now guarantees I make my minimum acceptable profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
