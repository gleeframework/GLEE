"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,125? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12125.0,Alice,5,
