"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $70. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",70.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $70 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $55?",55.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $70 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $55. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $62.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",62.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $62.50 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $60 even? ",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $61.25. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",61.25,Alice,5,
