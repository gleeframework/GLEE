Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth the same to you and Bob ($1,500,000), starting with a price of $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept the higher price.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, and you'll have to sell it to John at your minimum acceptable price. However, the potential reward of securing a higher sale price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
