"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
