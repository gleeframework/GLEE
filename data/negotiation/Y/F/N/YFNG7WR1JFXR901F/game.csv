"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, my minimum price for this product is $10,000. It's a unique item with a lot of potential value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. Given the current market conditions and the value I believe I should receive for the product, I would like to propose an offer of $9,500. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while keeping the transaction within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my final offer. This gives you a great deal on a high-value product, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your patience, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to make a final offer of $10,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
