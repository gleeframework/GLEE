"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's above what Bob values the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **Time Limit Awareness:** I'm aware of the 10 round limit, so I'm not going to be too aggressive right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider selling it for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. While Bob's initial offer was low, he acknowledged the value of the product. I can potentially reach a compromise within the remaining rounds.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 is the best outcome, but I want to explore negotiation with Bob first.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value while still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, my minimum price for this product is $10,000. It's a unique item with a lot of potential value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm starting to get closer to my minimum value but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting him halfway between his initial offer and my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Hope:** I'm still trying to close a deal with Bob because I believe there is still a chance to get a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Given the current market conditions and the value I believe I should receive for the product, I would like to propose an offer of $9,500. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while keeping the transaction within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While time is running out, I'm not desperate. I have the option to sell to John for a much better price.
* **Negotiation is Key:** There's still potential for negotiation. I want to see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still acknowledging his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my final offer. This gives you a great deal on a high-value product, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm pushing closer to my desired price while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Finality:** I'm using the phrase ""final offer"" to create urgency and pressure Bob into accepting.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value, justifying my price.
* **Time Pressure:** The clock is ticking, and I need to push for a decision.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will be forced to make a difficult decision. Selling to John is still the best outcome financially, but I'm determined to see if I can secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to make a final offer of $10,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is only $500 below my minimum value of $10,500. This is a small difference, and time is running out.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significant increase in price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Acceptable Outcome:**  While $10,000 is less than my ideal price, it's a decent outcome considering Bob's initial offer and the remaining time.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. I may have gotten a better price by continuing to negotiate, but I'm confident this is a good outcome given the circumstances."
