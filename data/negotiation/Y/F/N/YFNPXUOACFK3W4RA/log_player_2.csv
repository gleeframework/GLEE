"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $9,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is very close to her own valuation, leaving little room for negotiation. Since you can get the product for a significantly lower price from John ($8,000), it makes more sense to buy from him and maximize your savings."
