"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be immensely beneficial to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. $1,150,000 is still a significant gap from what I believe is a fair price. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'd hoped to spend. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
