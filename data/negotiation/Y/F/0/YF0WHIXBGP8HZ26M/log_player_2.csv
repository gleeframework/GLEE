"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $110?"",

``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still provides a decent profit margin for her. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further. Let's see if she's willing to go any lower."

""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  Could you do $120?  I think that's fair."",

We're getting close to my maximum budget, but this offer still allows me to save some money compared to John's price. It's worth a shot to see if Alice will agree."
