``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value of the product, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000.

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer to your maximum. Since you're not under time pressure and have John as a backup, it's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if you can get a lower price."
