"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, $9500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. This is a price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,
