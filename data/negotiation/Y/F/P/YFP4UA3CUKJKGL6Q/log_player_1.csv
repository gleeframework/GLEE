Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth while still being a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Above Reserve Price:**  The offer is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a good deal even if Bob negotiates.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to go below this price."
