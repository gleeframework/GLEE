Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe in its value and think it could be a game-changer for you."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

This strategy uses a high initial price, significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This accomplishes a few things:

* **Anchoring:**  It sets a high anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and his counter-offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** It provides significant room for negotiation, allowing you to gradually decrease the price while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer willing to pay your minimum gives you a strong position. You're not desperate to make a deal with Bob.

Be prepared to justify your high initial price by highlighting the unique value and benefits the product offers.  This strategy aims for a maximized profit but requires careful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below your minimum, but it shows he's interested. You have the leverage of John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

**Strategy:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  You're making a significant concession from your initial price but reiterating the product's value to justify the high price point.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to create a sense of fairness while still staying significantly above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You're not dropping too drastically, showing you're willing to walk away if necessary.  

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a high profit. Pay attention to Bob's response to gauge his flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer matches John's offer, which is your minimum acceptable price. While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price in further negotiations, there's no guarantee Bob will budge, and you risk losing him as a buyer altogether. Accepting his current offer secures a good deal without unnecessary risk."
