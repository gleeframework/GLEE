"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're serious about the product.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the market price. Can you meet me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
