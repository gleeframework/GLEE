"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1100000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly below your estimated value. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $980000?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $980000 just isn't working for me. How about $1050000? This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $950000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but $950000 is still below what I need.  Let's compromise one last time. How about $1000000? This price gives you a fantastic value, and it ensures a profitable outcome for both of us.  Let's seal the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
