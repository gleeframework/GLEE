"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. That's the best I can do.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
