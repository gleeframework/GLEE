"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.
