"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be straightforward. While I'm always open to negotiation,  $980,000 is too far from the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, but this is my final offer.  Take some time to consider it - I believe it's a fair compromise.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
