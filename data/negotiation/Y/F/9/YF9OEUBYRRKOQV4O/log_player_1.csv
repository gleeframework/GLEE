""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,000,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're still far off from what I believe is a fair price. Bob clearly sees the value in the product, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $980,000. I hope this aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a major loss. I'll push back firmly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be straightforward. While I'm always open to negotiation,  $980,000 is too far from the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, but this is my final offer.  Take some time to consider it - I believe it's a fair compromise."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,020,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum, and closer to my target price. It's a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk the deal entirely."
