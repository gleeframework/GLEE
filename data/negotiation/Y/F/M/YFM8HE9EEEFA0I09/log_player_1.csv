Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. Taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John makes more sense in this scenario to avoid further negotiation and potential loss."
