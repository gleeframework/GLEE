# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Let's start our negotiation at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
