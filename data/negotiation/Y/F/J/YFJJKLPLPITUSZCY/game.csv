"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $17,000? That feels like a fairer price that reflects the value it offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
