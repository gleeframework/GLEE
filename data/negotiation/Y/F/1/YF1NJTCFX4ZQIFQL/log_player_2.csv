"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $500,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement towards a deal.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I could go up to $650,000. If that works, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go below $750,000.  John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000. It makes more financial sense to secure the product at a slightly lower price from John, even if there's a small chance Alice might go lower."
