"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to your response.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement towards a deal.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I could go up to $650,000. If that works, we have a deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",750000.0,Alice,5,
