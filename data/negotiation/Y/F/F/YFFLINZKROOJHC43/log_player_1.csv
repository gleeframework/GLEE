Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
