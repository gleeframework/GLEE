**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price.  While we could try to push for an even lower price, there's a risk that she'll become firmer in her position or we might run out of rounds.  $900,000 represents a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,200,000, so it's a good point to accept and secure the product."
