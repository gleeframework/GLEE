"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to work with me, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you and a good deal for me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not quite ready to accept $750000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $850000. This is a compromise that we believe is fair and still represents a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not happy with my last offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000.  This is still significantly lower than your last offer and would allow us to both walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, we're still not quite ready to accept $800000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product at $875000. This is our final offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both find a reasonable solution.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not willing to go any lower than $875000. We believe this is the minimum price we can accept and still make a profit. If you're willing to meet us at this price, we're willing to finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,7,
