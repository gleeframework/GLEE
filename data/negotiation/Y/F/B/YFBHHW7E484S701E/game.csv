"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This is a considerable reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to find a fair deal. However, $1,075,000 remains below the minimum I can accept. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging our negotiation.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,150,000? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, but I also see the value in this product.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
