"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This is a considerable reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the product's value.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Her language (""final offer"", ""absolute lowest"") suggests she won't budge further.
* **Over budget:** Even at $1,200,000, you're exceeding your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a sure thing at your desired price.

While you could try squeezing Alice further, it's risky.  You've made good progress, but the potential savings aren't worth the chance of losing the product entirely."
