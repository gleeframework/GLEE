{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This initial offer sets a high price point, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.  Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my minimum target of $12,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit and offer you the product for $16,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value and quality of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000. How about $15000? Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is above my minimum target of $12,000 and a good compromise considering our back-and-forth. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd rather secure the deal than risk further negotiation."
