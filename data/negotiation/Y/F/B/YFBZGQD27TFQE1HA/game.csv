"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $14000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit and offer you the product for $16000.  This is a fair price, considering the value and quality of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000. How about $15000? Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $15000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
