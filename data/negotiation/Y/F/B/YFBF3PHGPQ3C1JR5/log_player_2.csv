"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far more than he's willing to pay. He has a better option with John, and there are still rounds left to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should offer the absolute minimum he's willing to pay, which is $12,000. This is his ""walk-away"" price, as he can always buy from John at that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, $16,000 is still higher than his maximum budget. He should continue negotiating with Alice, as he has more rounds available and a guaranteed alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should slightly increase his offer to $13,000. This shows he's willing to negotiate but remains within his budget.  Since Alice rejected his initial offer, he needs to show some willingness to move, but not too much.  There are still many rounds remaining, and John's offer remains a good fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $15,000 is within his budget, and he's already rejected a few offers.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  There's also the risk that if he rejects this offer, Alice will counteroffer at a price higher than $15,000, leaving him with a worse deal than he has now."
