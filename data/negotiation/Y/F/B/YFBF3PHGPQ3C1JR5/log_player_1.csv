"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While John offers my desired price, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal. There are still 8 rounds remaining to potentially improve the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will be willing to accept this offer. If he rejects, I'll have more rounds to negotiate, but I'll also be closer to the price offered by John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I have 6 rounds remaining to try and reach a price closer to my desired amount.  I'm also still holding out the option to sell to John for my desired price if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again, this time to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it's necessary to try and close the deal with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'm still comfortable selling to John for the same price. There are 5 rounds remaining, and I'm confident that this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
