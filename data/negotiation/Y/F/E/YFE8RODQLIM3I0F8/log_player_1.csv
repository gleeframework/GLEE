Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with the highest possible price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it. This sets a clear expectation of the value I place on the product and allows for negotiation. I'm ready to negotiate but also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  If he's unwilling to budge, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's also a fair price considering the product's value to him and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $850,000 is a reasonable offer given the ongoing negotiation. It's close to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and ultimately lead to a lower price. I'm willing to take this offer and secure the sale."
