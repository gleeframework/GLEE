"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business.  It's something that could significantly enhance your operations and bring you a substantial return on investment. I'm offering it to you at a price point that reflects its market value and potential for success.  Let's discuss further and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, there's room for negotiation.  You know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000, so you can use that as leverage. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her $800,000 valuation."
