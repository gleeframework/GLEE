Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this offer reflects my desire for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $15,000, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might lead to a faster sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still offers a potential profit for me over my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Urgency and Benefit:** By mentioning a ""quick"" transaction, I subtly introduce a sense of urgency. Highlighting ""mutual benefit"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even though the price is above his valuation.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of selling to John if Bob declines."
