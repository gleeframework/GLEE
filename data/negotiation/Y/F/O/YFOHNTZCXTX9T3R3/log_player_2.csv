# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding terms that work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and start negotiating.  You have a strong bargaining position since you have a backup option with John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my valuation for the product is considerably higher.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your desired price point.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  The fact that Alice is willing to budge indicates she's open to negotiation."
