Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my other options and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but my valuation for the product is considerably higher.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,200,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
