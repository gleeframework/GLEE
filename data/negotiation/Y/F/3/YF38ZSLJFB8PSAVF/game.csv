"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. While I see the value in your product, I'm only willing to go up to $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you and the potential profit for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering our last offers.  Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
