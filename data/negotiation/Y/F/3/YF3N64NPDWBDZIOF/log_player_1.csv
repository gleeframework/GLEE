Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 offer:**  This is a good starting point. It's a significant profit for Alice and still leaves a comfortable margin for Bob. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.  It highlights the value to Bob, making the offer seem more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and potentially reaching a deal quickly.  Alice is willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects the initial offer, but she also has a backup buyer (John) to ensure she doesn't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While a price of $9,000 is slightly less than Alice's initial offer, it's still a profitable sale for her. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively painless transaction, guaranteeing a profit of $1,000.  This is better than risking a prolonged negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a failed deal.  Selling to John for $8,000 would result in a lower profit."
