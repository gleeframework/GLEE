""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially even better deal.
* **Secure a Good Deal Quickly:**  While John offers a safety net, closing the deal with Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures a profit above the minimum."
