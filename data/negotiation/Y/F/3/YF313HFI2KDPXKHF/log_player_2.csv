Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000, her value for the product. Accepting at $10,200 secures a good deal for you and avoids the risk of the price going up or losing the deal altogether."
