"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, but $17,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
