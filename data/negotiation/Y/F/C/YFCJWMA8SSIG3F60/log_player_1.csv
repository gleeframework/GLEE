Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy allows you to see if Bob is genuinely interested and to gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still less than what I want. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still well above your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,200 is close to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be.  I've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and Bob isn't budging much further. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
