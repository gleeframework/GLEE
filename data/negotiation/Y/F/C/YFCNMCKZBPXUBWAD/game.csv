"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $15000 for it. It's a great deal and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $12500?  That's a fair price for both of us.  I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for such a valuable product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that this product is not worth the price you're quoting. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be closer to my budget. How about $11000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",11000.0,Bob,6,
