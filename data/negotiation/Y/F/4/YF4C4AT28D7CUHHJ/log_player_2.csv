# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and $10,000 to Bob.  Alice is offering $9,500. There is room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $9,250? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's new offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's target of $9,000, but it's closer to his goal and only $250 more than his last counteroffer. It's a good compromise.  Accepting the offer saves him $750 compared to buying from John."
