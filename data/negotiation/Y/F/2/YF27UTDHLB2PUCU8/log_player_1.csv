Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is a little higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to compromise if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and also lower than my initial offer of $110. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a fallback option:**  Selling to John for $120 is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail, but I want to explore the possibility of a higher price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good price for you, and a fair deal for me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm remaining positive and emphasizing finding a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Clear Counteroffer:**  I'm stating my new price clearly to avoid confusion.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (a good price for Bob, fair for me) to make it more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a fair profit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer than Bob's previous offer, it's not enough to make the sale worthwhile for me.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe there's still potential for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired amount.
* **John is the safety net:**  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I want to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer again, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to agree.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer to emphasize my willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining why $85 is a good price for both of us to make it more persuasive."
