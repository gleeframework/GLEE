"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good price for you, and a fair deal for me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.",85.0,Alice,5,
