"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's currently outside my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,350,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering your minimum and my maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows us both to benefit. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,650,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the deal. What are your thoughts?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a deal we can both agree on. While $1,650,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a bit more movement to make this worthwhile for both of us.  I'm willing to accept $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  However, $1,850,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000. This is a significant step for me and a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
