Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm not setting a ""take it or leave it"" price. This encourages Bob to engage and potentially start a negotiation that could lead to a mutually acceptable price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer.  My next steps will depend on Bob's response and the information I gain during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $500000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.**  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **There's room for negotiation.** While Bob's offer is low, his interest in the product indicates a potential for a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.**  If negotiations with Bob don't improve, I have a guaranteed backup offer with John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price. I will be sure to counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value to maximize my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $500,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer.  I'm proposing $700,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows us to reach a compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows I'm open to negotiation but still maintaining a fair price.
* **Reiterate value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value and  the fact that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Focus on finding a solution:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a way to ""find common ground"" to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll be closely watching Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll likely choose to sell to John for $800,000 as the guaranteed profit outweighs the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $650000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.** While it's closer, I'm not willing to accept a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  Bob is showing interest and willingness to compromise, suggesting there might be room for a better offer.
* **Selling to John is always a secure option.**  However, if negotiations with Bob can lead to a price closer to my desired value, it's worth exploring further.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and aim for a price closer to $800,000. My goal is to either get closer to my target or ensure that I don't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $650,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm  proposing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value but still allows for further negotiation.  
* **Show flexibility:**  My message highlights my willingness to compromise, demonstrating I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to view it favorably. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will push Bob closer to my target price.  However, if he continues to be unwilling to budge, I will likely sell to John for $800,000. The guaranteed profit makes it a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $725000, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.** Although he's shown a willingness to compromise, it's not enough to reach a price that's profitable for me. 
* **The risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain.**  There's a chance that Bob won't budge further, leaving me with a loss.
* **John's offer provides a guaranteed profit.**  By selling to John, I can secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement and ensures I don't risk a lower price with Bob.

While I would prefer to earn more, selling to John at $800,000 is the most logical and safe decision at this point."
