Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers significant value at this price, but let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $120, starting higher gives you room to negotiate or still profit if he accepts the initial offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $150 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob, leading to a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John gives you a strong position to hold firm if Bob tries to negotiate too low.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept $150. A different approach might involve a slightly lower initial offer to increase the likelihood of a quick sale."
