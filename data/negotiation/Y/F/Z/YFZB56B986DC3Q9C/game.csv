Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness,  $1800000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let me know if you're open to this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This price still reflects the product's value and rarity, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1520000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1520000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1450000, which is a significant investment for me.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
