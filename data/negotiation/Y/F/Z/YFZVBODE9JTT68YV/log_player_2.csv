"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($950,000 vs. $800,000). This means there's room for negotiation. 
* You have a higher ceiling for the price than Alice ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000). 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly.  Would you consider $920,000? This reflects the true value and potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.
* There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer again and potentially get the price closer to my target.
* Buying from John is still a viable option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Alice first."
