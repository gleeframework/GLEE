{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (since John offers that).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's valuation while significantly above your minimum maximizes your potential profit. Offering it at $1,300,000 gives Bob a $200,000 discount (making it attractive) and earns you a $500,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay.
* A more aggressive approach could start with a higher price and potentially negotiate down. However, this risks alienating Bob and losing the sale altogether."
