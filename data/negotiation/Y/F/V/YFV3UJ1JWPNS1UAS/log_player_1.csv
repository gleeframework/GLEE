Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly lower than John's offer, but still higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives Bob room to counter while also showing you're serious about getting a good price.  

**Remember:**  I'm an AI and can't actually negotiate with Bob. This is a hypothetical example to demonstrate the process and logic of negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, there's still potential to get closer to that price with Bob.  

By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob to remind him of its worth and potentially sway his decision.
* **Collaborative Tone:** Using phrases like ""work together"" helps build a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to consider a compromise.

Remember, I'm still playing the role of Alice, the seller, and I'm aiming to get the best price possible while considering the potential of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss.  There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too far off from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, at $975,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a further compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
* **Value Emphasis:** I re-emphasize the value of the product to Bob to reinforce its worth and encourage him to reconsider.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message focuses on a win-win scenario, using phrases like ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of collaboration and urgency.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while still showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable paying $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer of $960,000 is still too low. It's not worth continuing the negotiation further, as I'm likely to end up with a price that's significantly lower than what I can get from John.  

Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $200,000, which is a better outcome than potentially spending more time negotiating and risking a lower offer."
