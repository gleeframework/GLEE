"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $95 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about $100? It's a good compromise and allows us to close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $92? It's a fair price for me, and I'd be happy to buy the product at that price.",92.0,Bob,6,
