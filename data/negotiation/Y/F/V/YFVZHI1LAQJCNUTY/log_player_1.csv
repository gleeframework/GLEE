Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $90 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject this offer and keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $95 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about $100? It's a good compromise and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $92? It's a fair price for me, and I'd be happy to buy the product at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $92 is getting closer, we're running out of rounds.  It's better to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum price of $150."
