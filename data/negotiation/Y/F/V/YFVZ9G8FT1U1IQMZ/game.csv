"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a price point that works for you is important to me.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a firm offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price point.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
