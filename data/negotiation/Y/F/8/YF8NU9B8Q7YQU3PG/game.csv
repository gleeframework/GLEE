"I really like the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, but I was thinking maybe we could meet in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10500. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we try $11200?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11200, which would be $10850. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10850.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $10850 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10850 and $11200, which would be $11025. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11025.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the original price you quoted was $12000 and we've been negotiating down from there.",9500.0,Bob,6,
