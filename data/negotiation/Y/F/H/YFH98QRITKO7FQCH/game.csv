"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  This product sounds interesting, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $500000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $700000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's keep working towards a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
