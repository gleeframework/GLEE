"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You don't know enough about the product or what Alice's true value is.  It's better to explore if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  This product sounds interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $500,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to your offer, but it's still not ideal. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice is still willing to come down more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $700,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's keep working towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and $850,000 is a good price, especially considering you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high at this point."
