"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1300000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $1325000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $1375000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
