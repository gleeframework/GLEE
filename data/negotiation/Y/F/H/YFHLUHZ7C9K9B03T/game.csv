"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit much - how about we settle on $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
