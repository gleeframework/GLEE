"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits both of us."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than even my own valuation ($2,300,000), I aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. It allows me to gradually decrease the price while still aiming for a final amount significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident and Open Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value while expressing a willingness to negotiate. This approach encourages a collaborative atmosphere for the discussion. 
 
**Important Note:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I have 10 rounds to potentially secure a much better deal with Bob. It's strategically smarter to explore the negotiation with Bob before settling for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. I have room to negotiate, and John's offer provides a safety net. Proceeding to the next round and presenting a counteroffer is the optimal strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000  is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of  $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I reduced my initial price by $400,000, which shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price ($1,900,000) is still significantly higher than both Bob's offer and his perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to prevent him from anchoring too low. 
* **Aiming for Above Bob's Value:** My goal is to secure a price that's at least higher than Bob's $1,200,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us. $1,900,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is now above his own perceived value of the product ($1,200,000) and represents a reasonable profit for me. 

While I could try to push for a higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* Become frustrated and walk away from the negotiation.
* Lower his offer in future rounds. 

Accepting the $1,350,000 offer now secures a favorable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
