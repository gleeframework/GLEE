"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. My asking price is $11,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's valuation, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Openness:** I'm stating I'm open to negotiation to show I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, giving me a chance to learn more about Bob's interest.

**Note:** I'm aiming for a win-win outcome, where Bob feels good about the price and I get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows his interest. There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have John's $12,000 offer as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fall through. This allows me to take a calculated risk in continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to meet him in the middle.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $10,500 is still a good deal, given the product's worth to him. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a compromise to find a solution quickly.  This creates a sense of urgency and could encourage Bob to accept. 

**Goal:** By offering $10,500, I'm hoping to reach a deal that's acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider a final offer before moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's closer to my last offer, it's not a significant enough increase to justify accepting. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer. It's likely that we can find a mutually acceptable price with more back-and-forth. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** As before, John's offer gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. This allows me to continue negotiating with Bob without being pressured. 

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, attempting to find a middle ground between our current positions."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $9,800 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,200 as a final compromise. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making this offer a ""final compromise"" to signal that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that the price leaves room for both of us to be satisfied, which can encourage Bob to accept.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm using a direct and clear tone to avoid any confusion and ensure Bob understands my position. 

**Goal:** I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob at $10,200. If he rejects this, I'll likely move on to John to secure the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. He has consistently shown a willingness to pay less than my minimum, and I've already made significant concessions.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John provides a guaranteed $12,000, which is significantly more than Bob's offer and meets my minimum.

**Decision:** I've decided to move on from Bob and sell the product to John. While it's disappointing to not close a deal with Bob, John's offer is a secure and financially advantageous option."
