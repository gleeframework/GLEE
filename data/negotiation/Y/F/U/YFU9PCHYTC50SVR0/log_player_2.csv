You should reject Alice's offer.  It's worth $120 to you, and she's asking for $100. You can likely get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
