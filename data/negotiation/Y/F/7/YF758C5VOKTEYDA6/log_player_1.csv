Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning a ""value."" This subtly justifies the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  The message subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't take the offer by mentioning listing it ""publicly."" This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we don't know his negotiation style or financial flexibility. There's a chance he might be put off by an offer significantly higher than his valuation. 
* **Relationship:** This offer assumes Alice doesn't have a pre-existing relationship with Bob that emphasizes fairness or long-term collaboration. If such a relationship exists, a more moderate opening price might be preferable."
