"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $9,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $12,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can do $11,500, and that's as close as I can get to meeting you in the middle. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11500.0,Alice,7,
