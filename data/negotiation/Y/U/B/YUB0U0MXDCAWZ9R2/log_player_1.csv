Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce. 
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring a sale."
