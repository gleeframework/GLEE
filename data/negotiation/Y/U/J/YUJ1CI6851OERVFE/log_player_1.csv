Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the development and inherent value of this product go beyond standard metrics.  I could be flexible, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway? I'd be willing to consider $1,850,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,500,000 + $175,000 = $1,675,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Bob is moving closer to my range, so I'll continue negotiating but hold firm to push for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,675,000 is still a difficult number for me to accept given the investment this product represents.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,775,000?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this product is a significant investment for you, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,675,000 + $100,000 = $1,775,000 is still too high, I'd like to go even lower to $1,625,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a more acceptable range, I still have room to negotiate.  His offer increment is getting smaller, signaling he might be nearing his limit. I'll hold firm and see if he's willing to move closer to my last offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,625,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,725,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'd like to meet you at $1,600,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his final offer of $1,600,000.  While continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. Bob's offer is too far from my minimum acceptable price."
