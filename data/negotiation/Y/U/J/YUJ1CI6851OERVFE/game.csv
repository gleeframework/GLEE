"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the development and inherent value of this product go beyond standard metrics.  I could be flexible, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway? I'd be willing to consider $1,850,000.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,500,000 + $175,000 = $1,675,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,675,000 is still a difficult number for me to accept given the investment this product represents.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,775,000?",1775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that this product is a significant investment for you, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,675,000 + $100,000 = $1,775,000 is still too high, I'd like to go even lower to $1,625,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,625,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,725,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'd like to meet you at $1,600,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
