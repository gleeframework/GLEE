# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a fair price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you.

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and while I could try to haggle further, $850,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price. It's time to accept and secure a good deal."
