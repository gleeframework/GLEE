Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product higher than your minimum and you have a backup buyer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it for $1,350,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:**  Saves $150,000 from his perceived value.
    * **Alice:** Earns $350,000 more than John's offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" add pressure and encourage Bob to act quickly."
