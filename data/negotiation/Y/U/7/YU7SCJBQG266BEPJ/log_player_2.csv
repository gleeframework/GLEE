Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

While $115 is a better price than $120, it's still not the best deal you can get. You can likely still negotiate a lower price and get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

At this point, Alice's offer is very close to your target price of $120. It's likely that further negotiations will be difficult, and you risk losing the product. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's still within your budget."
