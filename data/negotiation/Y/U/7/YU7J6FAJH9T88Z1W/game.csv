"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $9,500?  This is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $8,000.  How about meeting in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $9,125? I think this is a good compromise that's fair for both of us.",9125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price. How about $8,900?",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $9,000?  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to consider selling to John.",9000.0,Alice,7,
