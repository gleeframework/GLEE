Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Note:** I'm aware that I could potentially sell to John for $15,000 right away. However, this approach allows me to explore a potentially higher price with Bob, while still maintaining a fallback option if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
