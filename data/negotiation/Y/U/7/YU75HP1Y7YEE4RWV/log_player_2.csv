"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($80). Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to negotiate a more favorable price.  $95 is still above Alice's minimum value of $80, leaving room for potential compromise and a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Bob's perceived value of the product.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to drive the price down further. There are still rounds left to potentially reach a more favorable agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $102 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $98.50?  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 98.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show Bob's commitment to negotiating a fair price.  By offering to split the difference, Bob demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a deal.  $98.50 is still above Alice's minimum value, allowing for a potential agreement within the remaining rounds."
