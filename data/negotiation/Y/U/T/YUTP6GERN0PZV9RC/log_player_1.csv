"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $8,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than the product's value to Bob but still lower than my minimum desired price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to increase his interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I have room to negotiate down to my minimum price of $12,000 if necessary.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below the value of the product to Bob.  
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I have time and rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting allows me to counter with a more reasonable price.
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my desired price.

**Next Round:** I will counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Moving Towards My Price:** I've moved down from my initial offer but am still above Bob's offer, bridging the gap.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that my offer is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth.

**Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum price. I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  While Bob is getting closer, there's still room for me to counteroffer and try to secure a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but I'm not desperate yet.  There are still rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Next Round:**  I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a ""split the difference"" solution, which can be appealing to people in negotiations.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the fairness and win-win nature of the deal.

**Strategy:** With only five rounds left, I'm trying to find a compromise that satisfies both of us while still getting a price I'm comfortable with."
