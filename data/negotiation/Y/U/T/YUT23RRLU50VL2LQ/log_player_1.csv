"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,450,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but also gives me a good starting point closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a good profit margin while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob completely."
