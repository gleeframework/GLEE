"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
 While Bob's offer is his maximum, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but accepting a $800,000 loss isn't an option.  I'll counter in the next round, aiming for a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, my initial offer reflects the true value of this product and the potential ROI it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair considering my needs and the product's potential.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm, but I'm not ready to give up $300,000 yet. There's still room for negotiation. I'll try to draw him up from his $1,200,000 offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000, but that's my final concession.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and ensures a win-win scenario."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,600,000 is still too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This shows my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering our current positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is finally moving from his $1,200,000 stance, I'm still leaving a significant amount on the table compared to John's offer. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can nudge him a bit higher.  The next counteroffer will be crucial in determining which way this negotiation goes."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  To be frank, selling at your price point would be difficult for me.  I can come down to $1,500,000.
