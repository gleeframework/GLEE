"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good price. However, $900,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm still open to negotiating.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it leaves you with a significant profit.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
