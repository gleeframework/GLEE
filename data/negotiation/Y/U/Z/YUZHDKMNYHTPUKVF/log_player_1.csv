{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob will see this as a fair price, knowing he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below my minimum:**  I still have room to negotiate lower if needed.
* **It's close to my alternative:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, making this a good fallback option. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good price. However, $900,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Remains above my minimum:**  I still have room to negotiate lower if needed, but I'm not giving away my product for less than $1,050,000.
* **Is closer to my initial offer:** This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise.
* **Still provides Bob a good deal:** It's significantly above his perceived value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $950,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm still open to negotiating.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it leaves you with a significant profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Remains above my minimum:**  I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Is a clear compromise:** This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Still provides Bob a good deal:**  It's still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $975,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John. I can't risk waiting for Bob to potentially come up even further.  John is a sure thing for a much better price."
