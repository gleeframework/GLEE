"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $15000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $15000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $17500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $17500 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16250? This would be a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",16250.0,Bob,4,
