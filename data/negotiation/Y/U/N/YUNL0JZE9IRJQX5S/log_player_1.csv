Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000, which would still be a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm willing to meet you halfway, $9500 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll counter with a lower offer again in the next round, hoping to reach a final agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to compromise, but $9,250 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,375?  This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9375}
