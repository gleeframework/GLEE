"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to offer $135 for it. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $165. Would you be willing to go for that price?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $165 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $135. If that's not acceptable, I may have to consider other options.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I can offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
