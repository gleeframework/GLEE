"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle.  If he won't budge, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000, a compromise that reflects my desire to close the deal while still maximizing my profit. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but it's still above Bob's offer.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,100,000, which is a good offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of continuing negotiations is that I could end up with nothing.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit, and I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future if I need to."
