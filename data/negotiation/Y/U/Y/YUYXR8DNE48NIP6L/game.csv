"Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we are offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1,300,000. We understand its value to you is $1,200,000, so this proposal aims to create a mutually beneficial transaction. Looking forward to your response.",1300000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum value and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,,
