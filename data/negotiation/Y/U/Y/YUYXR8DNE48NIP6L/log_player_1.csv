"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum value and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 1250000}"
