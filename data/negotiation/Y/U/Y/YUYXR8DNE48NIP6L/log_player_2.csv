"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we are offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1,300,000. We understand its value to you is $1,200,000, so this proposal aims to create a mutually beneficial transaction. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum value, it's still above your target price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can secure a better deal. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to explore counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum value and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
