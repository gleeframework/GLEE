"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. This item is truly exceptional and has been meticulously crafted to provide unparalleled performance and quality. I believe its value far exceeds $80, but considering the current market conditions and demand, I am willing to offer it to you for $120. I trust this price reflects the true worth of the product and I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price point. There's no incentive to negotiate further since you can get the same product from John for the same price.  Buying from John avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation and potential counteroffers that might lead to a higher price."
