"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. How about $87? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 

While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting $87 is a solid gain over my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.  It's always good to leave a little room for negotiation, but holding out for just a few dollars more isn't worth potentially losing the deal at this point."
