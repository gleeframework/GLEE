"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to purchase it at a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $875,000? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $875,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a counteroffer of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
