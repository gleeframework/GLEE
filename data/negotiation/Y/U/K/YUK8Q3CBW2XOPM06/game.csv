"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? This would give us both a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. That's the best I can do.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $775,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
