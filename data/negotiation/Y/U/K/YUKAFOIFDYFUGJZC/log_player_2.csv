"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  $9,000 is still closer to Alice's valuation than Bob's. Bob should try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Alice's offer of $8,875 is only $125 more than Bob's counteroffer, and it's the best price offered so far.  It's a good compromise that saves Bob $1,125 compared to buying from John.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and it's not worth risking the deal with John."
