"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,500 is above my minimum, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875?
