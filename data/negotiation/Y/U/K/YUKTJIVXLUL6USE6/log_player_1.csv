Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a substantial profit. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still far from what I ideally want. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'd rather sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, this ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
