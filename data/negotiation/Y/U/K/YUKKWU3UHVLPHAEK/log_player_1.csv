Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob and frames it as a good deal for both parties.
* **Flexibility:** This leaves space for counteroffers while still allowing me to potentially walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,000,000 is still a good price, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Potential for counteroffer:** I believe I can push for a higher price by counteroffering. 
* **John as backup:** I'm not desperate for a deal, and having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counter-offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value than Bob's offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the benefits for both parties, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit.

This counter-offer gives Bob an opportunity to reconsider while still putting pressure on him to accept a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially getting stuck in a protracted process.
* **John is a Safe Bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
