"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm a bit of a budget shopper, and I'm trying to save some money. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $110? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet at $105? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's closer to my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're getting close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet at $106? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a final push to meet in the middle.",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to hold firm on the price. If you're still interested, I'm open to negotiating further.",110.0,Alice,7,
