Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:** I'm staying below my minimum price ($15,000) to avoid immediately rejecting Bob's potential counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a good note. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation where I can earn a decent profit, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,500 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, there's still potential for a better deal.  I can counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 
* **John is a fallback option:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John, so I'm not in a desperate position to accept Bob's low offer.

I'll try to negotiate with Bob further, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I won't be losing money.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the mutual benefit of the deal.

By offering a slightly lower price and highlighting the benefits for both of us, I aim to encourage Bob to accept this counteroffer and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Close, but not there yet:**  While Bob has come up a bit, we are still quite far apart.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **John is waiting:**  I have a reliable buyer in John, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that doesn't benefit me enough.

I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can close the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $13,000 is closer, but still a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $13,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($13,500) and Bob's latest offer ($13,000). This demonstrates continued flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $15,000, but it's getting closer to Bob's desired price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:**  While Bob has continued to raise his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant improvement.
* **Risk of going lower:** Accepting Bob's offer at $13,250 would result in a significant loss for me.  Continuing to negotiate could further lower the price and erode my profits.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000.  This is a much more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's latest offer.

Given the circumstances, it's best to secure the guaranteed sale with John and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
