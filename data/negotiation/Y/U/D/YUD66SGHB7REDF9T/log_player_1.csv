Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and avoids mentioning the backup buyer, making Bob feel like he has a unique opportunity. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving room to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John if needed."
