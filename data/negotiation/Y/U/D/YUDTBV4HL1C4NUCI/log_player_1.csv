``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear price point and encourages Bob to respond. I'm prepared to adjust the price if necessary, but I want to start high and see if we can meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a loss.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
