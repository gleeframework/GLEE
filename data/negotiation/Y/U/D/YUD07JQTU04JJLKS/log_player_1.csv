"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a significant loss compared to my minimum value of $12,000, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. Selling to John right now would be a guaranteed profit, but I want to explore if I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more by pushing for $9,500. Selling to John now guarantees me a profit, but I'm not yet ready to give up on a potentially higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference and go with $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in round 6, and while I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm starting to run out of time. If I continue to reject Bob's offers, it's possible he will become frustrated and walk away.  Selling to John for $12,000 is still a good option, but it would mean missing out on a potential profit of $1,000. Accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 provides a decent profit while ensuring a successful deal."
