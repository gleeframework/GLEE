Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob can get the product from John for $1,200,000, so there's no need to settle for $1,250,000.  The next step is to counteroffer Alice again."
