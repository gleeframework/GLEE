Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $11,500 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $11,250 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $11,000 mark.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better price. Accepting the $11,250 offer is a reasonable compromise."
