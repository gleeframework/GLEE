"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a good starting point, it's still too high for Bob's desired price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $500,000.  This reflects my budget and what I believe is a fair price given the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** Bob is making a bold counteroffer, dropping the price significantly. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a deal. 
* **Justified Offer:**  Bob provides a reason for the counteroffer, mentioning his budget and a perceived value.  This keeps the negotiation professional and focused on the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving some space between the offer and his maximum ($800,000) allows for a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $550000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $550,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant drop from the initial price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that's favorable, while also avoiding the risk of the negotiation stalling or Alice increasing her price further.  There's always the possibility of a better deal, but the risk of losing this opportunity outweighs the potential for a few thousand dollars in savings."
