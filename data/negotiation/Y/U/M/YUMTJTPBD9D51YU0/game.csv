"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $500000.  This reflects my budget and what I believe is a fair price given the product's value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $550000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it.",550000.0,Alice,3,
