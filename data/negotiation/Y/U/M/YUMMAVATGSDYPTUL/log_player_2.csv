"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so you have time to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still leaves room for you to profit, while allowing me to earn a reasonable amount.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. You have 7 rounds left, giving you time to work towards your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still below what I need to get. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to gain something from this transaction. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but it's still above your budget.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. You have 5 rounds left, and it's still worthwhile to try and achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can find that middle ground and close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $915,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price that benefits us both. Let's get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $910,000. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, as it is within your budget and secures the product for you.  While you could continue to negotiate, with only 3 rounds left, there is a risk that Alice will walk away or that you won't be able to reach a better deal.  It's best to take the deal now, as it's a good outcome for you."
