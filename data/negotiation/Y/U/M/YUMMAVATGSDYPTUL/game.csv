"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still leaves room for you to profit, while allowing me to earn a reasonable amount.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still below what I need to get. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to gain something from this transaction. Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can find that middle ground and close this transaction.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $915,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price that benefits us both. Let's get this deal done.",915000.0,Alice,7,
