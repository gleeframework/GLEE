"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go as low as $10,500.  My final offer is $11,500.  It's a great price for this product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
