"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open.  I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for a much better price. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate allows me to potentially get a better deal.  

I will aim for a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also maintain a strong position.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to maintain a good negotiation atmosphere.

I'm hoping this counter-offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm also prepared to adjust further if necessary. I'm aware that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I want to ensure I get the best price possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for a significantly better price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I have several rounds left, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer, and offer the product for $117.50.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the progress we've made. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to find common ground.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

I'm aiming to push Bob closer to my desired price point while staying within a reasonable range. With only five rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and assertive while still fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is consistently showing interest and moving closer to my desired price point, $112 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for a much better price.  I have four rounds remaining, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal.  

I'll continue to reject Bob's offers and counter with prices closer to my desired range.  I'm hoping that with the pressure of time, I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're close to finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $114. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 114}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm using the ""final offer"" tactic to create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob. This might encourage him to accept my offer rather than risk losing the deal.
* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession, moving down from $117.50 to $114. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but it also makes it clear that I won't go any lower.
* **Positive and assertive:** The message is positive and assertive, emphasizing the need to reach an agreement.

I'm hoping this counter-offer will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects it, I will have to consider selling the product to John for $150, but I'm still optimistic that we can close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $114, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $110 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a much better deal with John.  While I've tried to negotiate with Bob, it's clear that we can't reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. 

This decision ensures I get the best possible price for the product, and it allows me to avoid further negotiations with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my price expectations."
