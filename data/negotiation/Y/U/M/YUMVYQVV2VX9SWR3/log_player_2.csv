"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at exactly that price. This means there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer.  You can reject her offer and still buy the product from John for the same price.  It's possible Alice might lower her price if you reject her initial offer, but you don't have any information to suggest that will happen."
