{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good chance of selling the product at a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is a better price than Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer.  I really want to make this work, but I need to stay a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Could you possibly lower the price to $100? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's very close. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale. It's better to make a profit than to potentially lose out on the sale entirely."
