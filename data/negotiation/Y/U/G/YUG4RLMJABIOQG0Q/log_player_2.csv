"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

$75 is a good price, but since I have a maximum budget of $120, there's room to negotiate.  I'll try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of reason. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident that I can get a lower price.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, as I still have room to bargain before having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. $65 is still a good price for me, and hopefully, Alice will be more receptive to this offer.  If she rejects this offer, I'll need to start considering buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $72 is only $2 more than my previous counteroffer of $70.  I'm getting close to my desired price range, and I'm concerned that if I continue to reject her offers, she might become less willing to negotiate. It's also worth noting that I only have 5 rounds left before I have to buy from John, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with the limited time. Therefore, I'm going to accept this offer and secure the product."
