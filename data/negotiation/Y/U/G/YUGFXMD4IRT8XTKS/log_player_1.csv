Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,""  Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What do you think?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just giving a yes or no answer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price that's significantly lower than his perceived value."
