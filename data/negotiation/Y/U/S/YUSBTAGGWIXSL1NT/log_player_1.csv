Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Minimum:**  The price is well above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a profit.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject $130. However, it's better to start high and potentially negotiate down. You always have the safety net of John's offer at $100."
