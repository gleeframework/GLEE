"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway at $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  I could go up to $700,000 for the product. I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $700,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is a fair compromise, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we settle at $725,000? That's the highest I can go.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $725,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Alice,7,
