Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway at $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $700,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $725,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. She's now attempting to inch the price back up. Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice and risk her increasing the price further."
