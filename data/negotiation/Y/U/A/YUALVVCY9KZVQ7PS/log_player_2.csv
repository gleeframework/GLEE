"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  It's a great product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make the purchase within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his desired price point.  He has already established a willingness to pay $1,200,000, and there are still 7 rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm offering the product to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,280,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,265,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1265000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I'm offering the product to you for $1,260,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been diligently negotiating with Alice, but at this point, the price is getting very close to his limit.  While he would ideally get it for $1,250,000, Alice has been steadily coming down in price.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiation and not getting a deal is high.  

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's still very good considering his initial goal, and it avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
