Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that price is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to go down to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to buy right now, but I can only go up to $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go that low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000. I can offer it to you for $10000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for less from John, and he has more rounds to negotiate with Alice. He may be able to get her down to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, but that's my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it is still higher than what he can get from John. With only 3 rounds left, Bob is unlikely to get Alice down to $8,000, and he's already spent several rounds trying. It's time to cut his losses and secure the product at the lowest price possible."
