"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. That's a good step. However, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at $800,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can see that you're trying to get it for a steal, but I'm not going to let it go for that price. My next offer is $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think that I should just consider selling it to John at the higher price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
