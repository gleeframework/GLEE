"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but your price is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is my best offer, as I'm looking to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value goes beyond its price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive support package and a 6-month warranty, which will give you added value and peace of mind. I'm still at $800000, but I believe the extras make it a more attractive offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
