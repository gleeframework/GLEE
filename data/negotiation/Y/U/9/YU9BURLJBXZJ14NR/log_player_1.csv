Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $100 to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of limited rounds, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering the product at $100. This is my minimum price, and I'm willing to stand firm at this point.  Time is running out, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree."
