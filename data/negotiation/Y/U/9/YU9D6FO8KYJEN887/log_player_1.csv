Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is a better deal than selling to John, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can come to a final agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $90 is just a little too low for me.  Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to offer the product for $95. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $85 is still a good deal.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk selling to John for less.  It's time to close the deal."
