"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I'm really interested in this product and believe it's a good value at this price.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $12500? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and performance. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think this product is great,  $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11500.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $11500 offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $13000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and performance. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
