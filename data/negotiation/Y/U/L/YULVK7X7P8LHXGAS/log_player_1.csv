I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a fair price, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000) and still leaves room for Bob to make a profit. I'm confident that he'll accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob. I believe it's a good chance for us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer and close enough to my desired price to warrant accepting. It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
