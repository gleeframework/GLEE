"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially maximize my earnings while still giving Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and come up with a counteroffer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe he will accept this offer, as it's a good compromise."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that he's not willing to go higher. I'm not confident I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds, so I'm going to sell to John for $800,000 to avoid further risk and secure a sale."
