# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John ($1,000,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to purchase from John and save $250,000."
