"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is a significant amount, I'm aiming to get closer to the $10,000 value. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a price closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go that high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about $8,875? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,875 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to $9,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we settle at $9,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm willing to pay. How about $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and the offers are getting closer to my minimum but still not there. It's likely that Bob will only go slightly higher. I'm not confident we'll reach a deal with him in the remaining rounds. I'll sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale at my minimum."
