"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a price closer to what I'm looking for.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go that high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about $8,875? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we settle at $9,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm willing to pay. How about $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,6,
