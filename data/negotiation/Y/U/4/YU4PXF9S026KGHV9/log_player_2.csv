"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the bargaining process and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious intention to negotiate.
