"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $15000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. That's a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
