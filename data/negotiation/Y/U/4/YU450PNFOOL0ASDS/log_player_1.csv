Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. That's a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** This message is designed to be persuasive and highlight the value Bob would be getting. 
* **Product Price:** $12,000 is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Reasoning:**

This approach aims to maximize profit while still considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  Offering $12,000:

* **Increases profit:**  A $4,000 profit is better than the $0 profit if Bob rejects the offer and I sell to John.
* **Maintains potential for acceptance:**  The price is attractive enough that Bob may be willing to pay, especially if he values the product highly.

This strategy balances risk and reward by offering a price that is both beneficial and appealing to Bob."
