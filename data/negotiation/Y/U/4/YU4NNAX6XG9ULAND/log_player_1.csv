Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to meet you at $115. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to go above $115, and we've already spent considerable time negotiating. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
