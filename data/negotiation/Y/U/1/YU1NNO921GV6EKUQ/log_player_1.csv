"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($12,000) and to Bob ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to the negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, reminding Bob why he might be interested in buying it. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly but not too much, keeping in mind that I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to close the deal, Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $15,000.
* **Risk assessment:**  I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's low offer. 

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit too low. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? It's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not too much.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Balanced tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and respectful, even though I'm rejecting his initial offer.

**Strategy:** 
I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my desired range while still being within what I believe Bob might be willing to pay. I'm also leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $12500 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a reasonable compromise:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum threshold of $12,000 and a good compromise considering our previous offers. 
* **Time is ticking:**  We are already in round 4, and I want to avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows for the possibility of future business with Bob, who seems willing to negotiate fairly.

This decision balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether and the potential for a future business relationship with Bob."
