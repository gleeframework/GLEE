"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $900000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me is no less than $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
