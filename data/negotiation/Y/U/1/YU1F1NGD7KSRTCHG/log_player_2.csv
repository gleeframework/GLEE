"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly at your maximum price limit. There's room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we're starting with a significant counteroffer that's 10% below Alice's price.
* **Message:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while emphasizing our desire to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Next steps:** We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. If she rejects our counteroffer, we'll adjust our strategy for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me is no less than $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $950,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value for Money:**  $950,000 is a good price for a product potentially worth $1,200,000 to Alice. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but there's also a chance Alice will walk away or we'll end up buying from John at $1,000,000.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting this offer gives us a good deal, saves us money, and closes the deal relatively quickly."
