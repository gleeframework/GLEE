"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but it's still a fair price considering Bob's maximum budget is $12,000 and the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price reduction. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product at a fair price and avoid further negotiation."
