Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,800. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional features that will make it even more valuable to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at $10,800 and doesn't seem willing to budge further.  The vague offer of ""additional features"" doesn't guarantee enough value to justify continuing the negotiation. It's not worth risking a higher price when you have a guaranteed option at $12,000 from John."
