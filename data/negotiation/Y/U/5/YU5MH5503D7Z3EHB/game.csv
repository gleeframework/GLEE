"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I go down to $175? That would be a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",150.0,Bob,4,
