Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong secondary buyer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could offer it at Bob's maximum value ($800,000), we know we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John. We need to aim for a price that benefits us significantly.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer and that Bob has priority creates a sense of urgency and might make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle on a price higher than $1,200,000.
* **Not Too High:**  Offering it at a price too close to $1,200,000 might discourage Bob, as the perceived value for him is lower.  $1,150,000 leaves a significant margin while still seeming potentially appealing to him."
