"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perception of the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies a willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility without drastically lowering the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both his perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the sure $800,000 from John, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm by rejecting Bob's low offer but demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price while acknowledging Bob's viewpoint to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The price reduction is significant enough to encourage Bob's engagement but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a significant improvement and surpasses my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
