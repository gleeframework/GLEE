"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he may be willing to come up a bit, but he likely won't meet my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I need to see if I can push for a better price. There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired amount by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still a fair price considering Bob's valuation. I'm hoping he'll see this as a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $1,100,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I need to see if I can push for a slightly better price before considering selling to John. There's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob to accept. We're both getting closer to a compromise, and I'm still confident I can get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now only offering $1,050,000, which is well below my minimum.  I've made several concessions, and it seems unlikely I can get a much better price.  To ensure I meet my minimum, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
