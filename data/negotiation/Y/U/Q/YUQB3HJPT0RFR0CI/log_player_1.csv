"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This takes into account your concerns and offers a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $875,000 is getting closer, I'm still determined to get closer to $900,000 and I think there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $875,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and come down to $887,500.  This is my final offer.  Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to offer $880,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $880,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $900,000,  it's a good deal considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of having to sell to John for $800,000."
