Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is a starting point that balances a few factors:

* **My minimum:** It's above my personal minimum of $15,000.
* **Bob's value:** It's below the maximum Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Potential for gain:** It's still a good profit for me, leaving room for negotiation if needed.

I'm leaving room for counteroffers, hoping to settle on a price closer to my ideal without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as a counteroffer could potentially get us closer to a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a step closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm trying to meet him halfway while still securing a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, the negotiation is becoming a little too risky.  I've already lowered my price twice, and while $12,800 is tempting,  it's still a bit below my comfort zone.  John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, so it's safer to just sell to him and avoid further haggling."
