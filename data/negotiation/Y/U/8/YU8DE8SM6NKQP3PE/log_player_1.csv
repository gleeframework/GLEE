{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum value of $8,000, giving you some wiggle room.  It's important to be willing to negotiate, but also to stand your ground.  By sending a message with the offer, you're not only presenting the price but also establishing a friendly and conversational tone.  This can help in building a rapport with Bob and potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but I can only afford to pay up to $8000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth exploring if you can get a little more. You can counter with a slightly higher price than his offer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000 to make this work for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still can't go above $8000 for the product. Would it be possible to meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob has made it clear he won't budge from his $8,000 offer.  While you could continue to counter, you risk exhausting time and effort without a better outcome.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees you your minimum value, ensuring you don't lose out financially."
