"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to accept from John.  This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price than selling to John right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to take $150 from John, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to encourage Bob to negotiate further.  I'm still above what I'd accept from John, but closer to Bob's offer.  This demonstrates flexibility and keeps the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I think I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's still slightly above what I'd accept from John, but I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer.  I believe there's a chance he'll accept, and I'm not willing to go lower.  If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've reached my limit with negotiations. I'm comfortable with John's offer of $150, so I'll sell the product to him."
