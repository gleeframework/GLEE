"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,280,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really making me work for this! I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,265,000?",1265000.0,Bob,6,
