Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. While she has a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, she can potentially make more if Bob is willing to pay above that price.

**The Challenge:** Alice doesn't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value of $1,200,000.

**The Strategy:**  Alice should aim for a price that's attractive to Bob but also profitable for her. 

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. It's something I highly value, but I believe it could be of significant benefit to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, highlighting the potential value to Bob without revealing Alice's bottom line.
* **The Price ($1,600,000):**  This is slightly above Alice's guaranteed price with John. It leaves room for negotiation while ensuring Alice profits even if Bob negotiates down.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer. Alice needs to decide how low she's willing to go. If Bob won't budge above $1,500,000, Alice is better off with John.
* **Information is Power:** In real-world negotiations, gathering information about Bob's needs and constraints could help Alice tailor a more effective offer."
