Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to go, and it's still below my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount."
