"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about $100?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $90.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98, which is a fair compromise considering my minimum price. Let me know what you think.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again from my last offer of $95. Would you be willing to consider a price of $97? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.0,Bob,6,
