Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding both their valuations.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""potential,"" Alice aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but suggests a starting point for discussion. Phrases like ""I'm proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" invite Bob's input and potential counter-offers.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:** This approach assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If Alice knows Bob prefers quick deals or is put off by seemingly inflated prices, a different strategy might be better. 
* **Market information:**  While not explicitly stated, if Alice has reason to believe the product might be worth even more to Bob due to specific circumstances, she might push the price higher. 

This first offer is designed to maximize Alice's potential profit while acknowledging the information she has about Bob's valuation."
