"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000?  That gives you a great price and still lets me get closer to what I need.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $10,750. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, but that's really my absolute bottom line.  I'm not sure if you're willing to go that high, but it's the best I can do.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750, but I'm not sure if that's something you'd be willing to accept. I'm getting close to considering buying from John.",10750.0,Bob,6,
