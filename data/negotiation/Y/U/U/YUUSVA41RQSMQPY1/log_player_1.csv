Round 2

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000?  That gives you a great price and still lets me get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my goal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, but that's really my absolute bottom line.  I'm not sure if you're willing to go that high, but it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750, but I'm not sure if that's something you'd be willing to accept. I'm getting close to considering buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're at a stalemate with Bob, and while $12,000 is my minimum, it's still a better deal than continuing to negotiate and potentially losing out."
