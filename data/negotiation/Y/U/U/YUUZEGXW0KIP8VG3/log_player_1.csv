Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I have the option of going to John, who offers my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Even though I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  I will counter-offer with a higher price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  $11,500 is a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the compromise and the fair price, highlighting the value proposition for Bob.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not losing out significantly if Bob rejects this offer."
