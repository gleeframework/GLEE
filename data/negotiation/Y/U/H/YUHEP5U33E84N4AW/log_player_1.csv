"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the perceived fairness of the price. This can help build rapport and potentially encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I have 10 rounds to work with.
* By starting at $12,000, I'm testing the waters and seeing if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* Remember, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 at any point, so I don't need to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he is willing to negotiate. I still have 8 rounds to try and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have the security of John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $9,000, but still lower than my minimum price. I'll aim to find a middle ground that might be attractive to Bob."

Round 3

**Strategy:**

* By offering $11,000, I'm testing whether Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.  
* I'm also leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower my price slightly in the next round, while still staying above my minimum. 
* I'm confident that I can find a price that works for both of us, but I also have the security of John's offer if negotiations fail."
