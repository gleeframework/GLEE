"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $700,000 for it. Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $760,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a new price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
