Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher initially allows room for negotiation or a quick win. 
* **Staying above Bob's value:** Offering it at $140 is still above Bob's perceived value ($120), but not so high that it's immediately off-putting.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price gives Bob the impression of a potential bargain and might encourage him to accept. Even if he tries to negotiate, you have some buffer to lower the price slightly and still come out ahead of selling to John."
