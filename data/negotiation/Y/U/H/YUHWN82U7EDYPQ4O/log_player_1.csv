"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price,  $2,000,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This is a bold opening move, but it leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  It's a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $1,750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more.  I'll see if we can meet in the middle with another counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm offering $1,850,000.  This is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It's a strong indication that I'm serious about a deal, but also shows that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd like to get a bit more, $1,725,000 is a good price and significantly higher than John's offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid risking losing the deal entirely."
