"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $600,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's potential to get a better price, especially since Alice has already expressed her eagerness to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $500,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm confident this product will be valuable, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $600,000 to $550,000. This is a significant drop and puts the price within Bob's target range.  Since John is selling the product for $800,000, accepting Alice's offer at $550,000 is a much better deal for Bob. While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and ending up buying from John at a higher price is too great."
