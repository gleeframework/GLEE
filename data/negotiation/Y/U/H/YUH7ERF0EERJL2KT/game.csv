"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $500,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm confident this product will be valuable, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",550000.0,Alice,3,
