```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also sets the tone that I value the product highly. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and it's getting close to the point where it might be more beneficial to sell to John for $8,000. It's time to secure a deal and avoid further risk of a lower offer or a drawn-out negotiation."
