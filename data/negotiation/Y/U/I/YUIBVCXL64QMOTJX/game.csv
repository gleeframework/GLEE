"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a significant sum, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,275,000? This feels like a strong compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,225,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a final offer at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
