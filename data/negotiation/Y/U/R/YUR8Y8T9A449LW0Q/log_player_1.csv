Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a decent compromise, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $9,000. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.

My next offer to Bob will be:

{""product_price"": 11,500}

I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway and accept this offer. If not, I'll continue to negotiate or consider selling to John for $15,000."
