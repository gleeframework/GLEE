Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  The ideal price is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. This allows you to make a profit beyond John's offer while still being attractive to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confidence and Exclusivity:** The message starts by piquing Bob's interest and implying strong demand.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, highlight the ""unique value proposition.""
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, stay firm on your minimum price ($1,500,000) but be willing to adjust slightly if it secures the deal."
