"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and what I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet closer to the middle ground at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below your minimum. At this stage, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too small to risk further negotiation. It's more profitable to sell to John for a sure $12,000 than to potentially end up with even less from Bob."
