"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup option.** Bob can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, reflecting the value I see in the product and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  I'm confident that the value this product brings to you is much greater than $1,200,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price range and leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **There's still potential to get a better deal.**  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push Alice further down in price. 
* **John is still a viable option.** Bob can still choose to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,262,500. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1262500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm encouraged by your recognition of the product's value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,290,000. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.** It's lower than the $1,325,000 she offered in the previous round, and only slightly above Bob's last counteroffer of $1,262,500.
* **Negotiations are getting close.**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **John is still a backup.**  If Bob doesn't like this offer, he can still buy from John, but this would be at a significantly higher price.

By accepting this offer, Bob gets a good deal and saves a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
