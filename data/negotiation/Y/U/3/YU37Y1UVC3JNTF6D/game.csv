"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, reflecting the value I see in the product and a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  I'm confident that the value this product brings to you is much greater than $1,200,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,262,500. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1262500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm encouraged by your recognition of the product's value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,290,000. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
