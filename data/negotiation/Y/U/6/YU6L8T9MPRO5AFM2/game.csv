"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $1600000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down to $1700000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1650000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1650000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $1675000. This represents a further compromise on my part and demonstrates my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting close to my target, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1660000, but I'd like to see if we can get even a bit closer to that number. My revised offer is $1665000. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1665000.0,Bob,6,
