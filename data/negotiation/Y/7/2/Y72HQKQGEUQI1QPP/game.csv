"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm confident in the $11,000 value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $10,250 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,800?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while you still get a solid profit.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a way to make this work.  However,  $9,800 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $10,000. It's a firm price, but I believe it reflects the true value of what you're getting.",10000.0,Alice,5,
