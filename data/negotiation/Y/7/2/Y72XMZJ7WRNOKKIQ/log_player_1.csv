"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get a good deal. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a positive tone and framing it as a good deal for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** I've left room to negotiate, so Bob has a chance to counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

I want to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open.  Starting high gives me more room to lower the price during the counteroffers, if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for improvement.  I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer of $100. 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is my minimum, I have 9 rounds remaining.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** I use positive language and encourage Bob to agree.
* **Focus on the middle ground:**  I'm framing this as a fair solution that benefits both of us.

**Reasoning:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I show flexibility. This keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better outcome than my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to counteroffer at $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Considering we have only 6 rounds left, I'd rather secure the deal and avoid further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

The risk of continuing to negotiate is that we might not reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are over, forcing me to sell to John at $80.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a higher price and avoids the potential for a worse outcome."
