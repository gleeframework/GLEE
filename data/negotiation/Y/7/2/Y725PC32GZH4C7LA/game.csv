"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of the value this product could bring to you, and I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm thinking of the value this product could bring to you, and I'd like to propose a price of $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,5,
