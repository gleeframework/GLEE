"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $7,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7,000. Can you consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
