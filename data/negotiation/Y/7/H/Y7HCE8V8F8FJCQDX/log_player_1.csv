Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I want to maximize my potential profit."

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to accept it at this stage. I believe I can get more.  I will try to negotiate further with Bob."

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a good price for me, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."

Bob is getting too low. I'm not comfortable selling for less than $1,000,000.  I'll make a counteroffer, but if he doesn't budge, I'm going to sell to John."

I'm tired of negotiating with Bob. He's not willing to meet my price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
