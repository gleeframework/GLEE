"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** We start significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""potential"" and ""true worth,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of value higher than his initial $1,000,000 assessment.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, we also recognize the security of John's guaranteed offer.  We don't want to start so high that Bob walks away immediately, as we still have room to negotiate down significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to purchase the product for a price that's more reasonable for me. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, we're only in Round 2. Bob offering his perceived maximum value this early suggests there's potential to negotiate him higher. We'll reject and counter-offer to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's potential significantly exceeds that price point.  To meet you closer, I'd be willing to part with it for $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down by a significant amount ($300,000), which demonstrates flexibility and a desire to find a deal. 
* **Still Above Target:**  This price point keeps us well above both Bob's perceived value and John's offer, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We're subtly shifting away from broad ""potential"" and hinting at concrete reasons why it exceeds Bob's valuation (without revealing specifics that might weaken our position)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is now moving upward from his initial offer, indicating a willingness to potentially exceed his perceived value.
* **Profit Potential:**  We're still significantly above John's offer, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  While we have time, waiting too long to counter risks ending up closer to John's offer when rounds run out.  It's time to incentivize Bob to move closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a very competitive offer considering the unique benefits this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our offer by $100,000, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line but still open to a deal.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge Bob to stretch his budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This keeps us safely above John's offer while encouraging Bob to make a significant move if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Profit:** Bob's offer is now $250,000 above John's guaranteed price. This represents a substantial profit margin.
* **Slowing Momentum:**  Bob's increases are getting smaller ($50,000 this round), suggesting he might be reaching his limit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
