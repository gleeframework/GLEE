Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Bargaining:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has some room to negotiate upwards without losing out. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** By starting high, I establish a strong initial position and can potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he rejects my initial offer, I will consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than my initial offer. While it's still above my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. It also shows Bob that I'm not willing to settle for anything less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Balancing Risks:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I believe there's a good chance of securing a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. I will carefully consider Bob's financial situation and his initial offer to determine a fair counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,125,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering a price halfway between our previous offers, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much. This offer still allows me to earn a significant profit while showing Bob that I'm serious about securing a deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to weigh my options: 

* **Counter-Offer Again:** If Bob's counteroffer is close to my offer, I might consider making another compromise.
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob continues to be inflexible, I'll likely choose to sell to John for $1,000,000.  While it's not the ideal outcome, it's better than risking losing too much time and potentially lowering my price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm tempted to accept, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price. I'm not yet at a point where I need to settle for the minimum. 
* **Risk Assessment:** I need to weigh the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer against the possibility of securing a slightly better price. I believe the potential reward outweighs the risk at this point.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer. I will aim for a price closer to $1,100,000, taking into account his previous counteroffer.  I will be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to be inflexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway from his last offer.
* **Close to the Deal:** I believe this price is likely to be acceptable to Bob. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is only $25,000 less than his initial offer.
* **Minimum Acceptable:**  This price is also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm cautiously optimistic that Bob will accept this final counteroffer. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $1,075,000.  
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Minimizing Losses:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome.  
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of wasting more time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most prudent decision. It guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price after further negotiation."
