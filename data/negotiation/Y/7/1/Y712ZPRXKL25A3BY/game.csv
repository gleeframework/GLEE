"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your effort. However, based on my research and understanding of the market, I believe the fair price for this product should be around $75. I hope we can come to an agreement.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's quality and my initial offer.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $78 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our discussions.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not convinced that $78 is a fair price for the product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $81. It's a small compromise, but I think it's a good balance between our values.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in negotiating. I appreciate your compromise. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I would like to propose a final offer of $79 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our discussions.",79.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I'm still not convinced that $79 is a fair price for the product. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the same price John is willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",80.0,Alice,7,
