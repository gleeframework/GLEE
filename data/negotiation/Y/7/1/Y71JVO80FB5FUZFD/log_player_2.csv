"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable for your business. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is claiming the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to her.  This means she's likely to be asking for more than it's actually worth to her.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
