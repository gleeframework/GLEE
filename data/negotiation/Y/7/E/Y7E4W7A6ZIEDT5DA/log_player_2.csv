{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold onto this product.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Could we compromise at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still paying more than what I could get from John, and you'd be closer to your desired price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget. I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit of this price point, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is still above my budget. While she has lowered the price, I'm not willing to accept such a high price. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to find a price that is more agreeable.  It's getting closer to my limit, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,200 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let's reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $11,000. While I'm aware this is my absolute limit, I want to emphasize the fairness of the price.  This time, I'm not proposing a new price, but reiterating my previous offer, making it clear that this is my final stand."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your price of $11,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, it's still above my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, and I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Considering the limited number of rounds left, I'm choosing to buy from John.  It's the safest option to ensure I get the product at a price that works for me."
