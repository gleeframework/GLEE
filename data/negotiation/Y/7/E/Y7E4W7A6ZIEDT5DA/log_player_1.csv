Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold onto this product."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Could we compromise at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still paying more than what I could get from John, and you'd be closer to your desired price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
