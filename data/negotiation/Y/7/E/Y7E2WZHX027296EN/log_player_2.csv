Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $142. I'm willing to meet you at $144, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $144. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower and we are quickly approaching the price John offers. Taking it down another dollar is unlikely and risks her accepting. It's better to secure the deal at $144 rather than risk missing out and having to pay $150."
