"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is substantial, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1400000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm also aware of another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1000000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, I believe $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1300000. This price still allows me to achieve my minimum goal, and it's a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's continue this discussion and find a solution that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1250000 still falls short of my minimum target.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1275000 for the product.  This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
