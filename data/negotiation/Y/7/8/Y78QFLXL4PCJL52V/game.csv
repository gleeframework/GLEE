"I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. That's the lowest I can go while still making a profit. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,5,
