"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Could you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still firm on my minimum price. Let's split the difference again.  $10,150 would be a fair compromise, and a good deal for you.  What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,150. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
