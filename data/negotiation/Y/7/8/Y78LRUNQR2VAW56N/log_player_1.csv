Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a profit if he accepts the initial price.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale with John."
