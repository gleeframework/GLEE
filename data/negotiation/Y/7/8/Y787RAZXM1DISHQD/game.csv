"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $825,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $775,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,
