Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, he can still get the product for less from John. There's no reason to accept a price higher than what John is offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I think $1,300,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from my perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Alice is now asking for more than Bob's maximum price ($1,200,000).  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John to secure the product within his budget."
