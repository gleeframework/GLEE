Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. How about a price of $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While $95 is still a profit for you, it's relatively close to Bob's perceived value of $80. This increases the chances of him accepting the offer rather than risking losing out on the product entirely.
* **Above John's Offer:** The offer is still significantly above your guaranteed $100 from John, ensuring you maximize your potential profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
