Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle - would $900,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This would still leave you with a significant profit margin and allow me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
