Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a price that's fair to both of us. How about $1,050,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin and allow me to get closer to my desired value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too far from my target.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.
