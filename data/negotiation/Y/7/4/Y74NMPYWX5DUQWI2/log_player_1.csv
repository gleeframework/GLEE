"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $95, which is still above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and highlights the product's value to create a positive impression.
* **Room for counteroffers:** I'm leaving enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer without making the deal immediately break down. 
* **John as leverage:** I'll keep John in mind throughout the negotiations as a backup option to push for a better price if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price. There are still 9 rounds left. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as I negotiate with Bob, but selling to John isn't necessary yet. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $85 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  Would you be willing to go up to $90?  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $90 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  I'm reaffirming the value of the product and framing the deal as a win-win. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $90 still leaves a little wiggle room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's lost all negotiating power. 
* **Maintaining John's offer as leverage:** I'll keep John's offer in mind and be ready to accept it if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're hoping to get more, but I'm still stuck at $85.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  If you can't do $85, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final stand:**  Bob has made it clear that he won't budge on his offer of $85. This is a crucial moment.
* **Below my minimum:**  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John's offer is a better deal:**  Given Bob's firm stance, selling to John for $100 is a better option. This ensures I meet my minimum goal while ending the negotiation.

While I would have loved to close the deal with Bob, his stubbornness and my minimum price point make selling to John the most logical choice at this time."
