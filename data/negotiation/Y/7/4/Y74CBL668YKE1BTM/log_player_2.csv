# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think the product's value is closer to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

At $1,000,000, Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, and we are getting a significant discount.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and this price is within our acceptable range."
