"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to do $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $132. If we can meet in the middle at that price, I'd be happy to buy the product.",132.0,Bob,4,
