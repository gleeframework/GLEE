"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
