While $1,175,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is closer to my target price of $1,050,000.  It's still higher than I'd like, but I'm comfortable accepting this offer.  It's better than buying from John for $1,500,000."
