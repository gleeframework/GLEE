Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

It's unlikely we'll get Alice significantly lower than $10,250.  At this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the better option to ensure we stay within budget."
