Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).**
* **I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob.** It's worth exploring if we can reach a better price. 
* **Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'm aiming for a higher price.**"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).**  
* **I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob.**  I'm still hopeful of reaching a higher price.
* **Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'm trying to maximize my profit.**"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would allow me to make a small profit and still get this product in your hands."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).** 
* **We have only 4 more rounds left.** Time is running out, and it's unlikely Bob will offer a significantly higher price.
* **Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a safe and acceptable outcome.**  While I would like to earn more, it's important to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
