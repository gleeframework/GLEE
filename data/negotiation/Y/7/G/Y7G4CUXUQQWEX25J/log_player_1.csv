Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to accept something too low.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation going while still protecting my minimum profit. I'm ready to counter if necessary, and I have John as a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there's room for a counteroffer that would be more advantageous for me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control and shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price.

By rejecting the offer, I can make a counteroffer that attempts to bridge the gap while still ensuring a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price and gives me a reasonable profit.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly at the midpoint between my last offer of $11,000 and his previous offer of $9,000. This suggests a willingness to compromise.
* **Minimum acceptable price:** While $10,000 is not ideal, it does meet my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there is a chance he will walk away, and I might end up selling to John at $15,000, but that is less profit.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a reasonable price, mitigating the risk of losing a sale altogether."
