Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is far above my budget. Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value and our current discussion. I believe this is a good compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Cutting my losses now and selling to John guarantees I get the best possible outcome."
