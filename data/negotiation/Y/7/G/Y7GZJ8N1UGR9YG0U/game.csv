"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is far above my budget. Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I can't go lower than $1,150,000.  This product has significant long-term value that I'm confident justifies this price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value and our current discussion. I believe this is a good compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
