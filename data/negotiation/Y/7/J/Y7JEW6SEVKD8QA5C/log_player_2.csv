"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's only fair to present my opening offer at $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $750,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $700,000. My counteroffer is $725,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $725,000 is still a good discount compared to the initial $800,000, and it's getting closer to Bob's desired price point.
* **The risk of continuing is high:** If Bob rejects and continues to negotiate, there's a chance Alice will stick to her price or even raise it. There are also only 7 rounds left.
* **Jhon is a safety net:** Bob knows he can always buy from Jhon for $800,000 if the negotiation with Alice completely fails.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price."
