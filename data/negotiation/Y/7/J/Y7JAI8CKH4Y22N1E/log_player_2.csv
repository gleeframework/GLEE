"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows for the possibility of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($150) is a good strategy. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and sets a lower starting point for the bargaining process.  $120 is a substantial reduction, but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my maximum budget, I still want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, showing some flexibility. I'm increasing my offer to $130, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. This indicates a willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price considering my initial goal was to spend no more than $150. Accepting this offer is a good outcome, as I've saved $15 and secured the product.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal or the negotiation dragging on for too long.  It's a good time to close the deal."
