"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I believe the product is worth to you. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair price considering both our positions.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,200,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it in previous offers.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
