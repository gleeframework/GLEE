"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially getting a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I believe the product is worth to you. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still too high. While it's a compromise from her previous offer, it's still above the midpoint between our valuations.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair price considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,200,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it in previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal, considering:

* **It's close to my valuation:** I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so this is a significant savings.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:**  We've been going back and forth, and it seems unlikely she'll drop below $1,250,000.
* **John's price is higher:**  If I reject this offer, I'll have to pay more to John.

Therefore, accepting the offer is the most rational decision to get the product at a reasonable price."
