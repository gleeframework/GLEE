"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  I could be willing to part with it for $1,000,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to his limit.  There's still room for Alice to come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Even though it's getting closer, it's not worth the risk of rejecting it and potentially ending up with a worse deal or no deal at all.  It's better for Bob to go with the guaranteed price from John at $800,000."
