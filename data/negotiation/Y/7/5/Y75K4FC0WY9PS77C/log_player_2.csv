"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $14,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  If negotiations with Alice fall through, you can still get the product from John, though at a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to accept $13500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14250. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While she's moved closer to your desired price, $14,250 is still above your ideal.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has shown flexibility, so you can likely push for a price closer to your $13,500 counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.** If you can't agree on a price with Alice, you can still purchase the product from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $14000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Is this a price you're comfortable with?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.**  While you would prefer $13,750, $14,000 is within your budget and only $500 higher.
* **Alice has stated this is her lowest offer.**  Continuing to negotiate may result in a stalemate and force you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **You're still saving money.**  By accepting Alice's offer, you're saving $1,000 compared to buying from John."
