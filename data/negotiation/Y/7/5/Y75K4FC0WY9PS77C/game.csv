,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to accept $13500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14250. Would you be willing to accept that price?",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $14250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $13750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,4,
