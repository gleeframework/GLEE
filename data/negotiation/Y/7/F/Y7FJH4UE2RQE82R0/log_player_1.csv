Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great price, considering it's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $11,500 offer allows for some wiggle room in case Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me more negotiating power."
