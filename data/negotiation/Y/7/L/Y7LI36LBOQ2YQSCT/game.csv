"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,100,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is below what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,080,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price is cutting it a bit too close for me. I could consider $1,110,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
