Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,250? It's still a fair price for the product's quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16250}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $15,500 is a good compromise and still above my minimum. It's worth closing the deal now rather than risking further negotiation and potential stalemate."
