I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's a fair compromise between my minimum value ($80) and the estimated value to Bob ($150). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $110. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal."
