"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
