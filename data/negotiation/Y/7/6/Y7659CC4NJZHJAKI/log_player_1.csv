I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate higher.  I'm also aware that I have John as a backup, so I'm not overly reliant on Bob accepting this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price,  I believe I can get more. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I believe it's still a fair price given the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his offer, and I've already made a concession.  I don't want to risk a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a stalemate. It's time to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
