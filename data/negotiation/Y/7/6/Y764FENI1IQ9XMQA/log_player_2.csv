"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and even the value John offers. It's highly unlikely she'll go that low immediately, so a counteroffer is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a common tactic in negotiation to start low. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Psychological Anchor:** By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.  Even if Alice completely rejects this offer, her counter might be influenced by the low number.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her response will give me valuable information for the next round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for the value this product provides.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $110 is still more than you're willing to pay, especially when you can get it for $100 from John.  There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $80? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  Instead of jumping drastically from $60, this counteroffer shows willingness to move towards Alice's price, but at a controlled pace. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" reinforces that you're aiming for a deal that works for both parties.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to your $100 walk-away point (buying from John) but still leaves room for negotiation in case Alice is completely unwilling to go below $100."
