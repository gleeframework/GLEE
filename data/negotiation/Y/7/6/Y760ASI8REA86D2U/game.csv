"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,000? It's a great compromise and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
