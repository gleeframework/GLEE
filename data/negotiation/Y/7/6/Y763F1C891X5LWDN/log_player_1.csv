Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a price higher than that ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:**  If Bob accepts the $10,000 offer, we secure a $2,000 profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can always fall back on selling to John for our minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of securing a sale with Bob."
