"I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob. However, I've invested significant resources in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at least at $950000 to make it worth my while.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $960000, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet at a price that works for both of us.
