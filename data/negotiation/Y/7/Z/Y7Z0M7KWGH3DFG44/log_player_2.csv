"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  He can get a better deal from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for his maximum budget of $800,000. This counteroffer sets a firm price point and leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's budget.  He can get the product for less from John, so it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice in the hopes of reaching a price closer to his $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $800,000 to $900,000, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still staying within a reasonable range for his budget. This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying the product but also won't overpay."
