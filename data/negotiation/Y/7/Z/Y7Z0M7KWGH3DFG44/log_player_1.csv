Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This is a reasonable starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** You still have plenty of room to negotiate and potentially secure a sale closer to your ideal price. 
* **It allows for flexibility:**  If Bob balks at the initial offer, you can adjust downwards strategically. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below your minimum value and doesn't reflect the potential worth of the product. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This counteroffer represents a significant decrease from your initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above Bob's valuation and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still significantly lower than what you initially hoped for, it's much closer to your minimum acceptable value.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and secures a profit."
