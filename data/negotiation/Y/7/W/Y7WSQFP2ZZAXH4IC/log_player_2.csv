Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $1,075,000 and a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. 

While there might be room for further negotiation, accepting this offer ensures a successful purchase within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
