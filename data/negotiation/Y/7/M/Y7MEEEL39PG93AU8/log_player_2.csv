"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a real game-changer and I know you'll appreciate its value. I'm starting with a price of $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
