"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's my maximum budget for this purchase.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I can go up to $85, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $90 is the lowest I can go. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $85, and I'm not comfortable paying $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $87.50 is the most I can offer.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $88 for the product. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather sell it to you than go through the hassle of finding another buyer.",88.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $84.50, and that's as high as I'm willing to go.",84.5,Bob,8,
