"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to get the lowest possible price and knows Alice's minimum is $1,000,000. 
* **Counteroffer:** A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategy:** Bob aims to gradually increase his offer if needed, but his goal is to stay below $1,200,000 to avoid buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Situation:**  Alice has lowered her price to $1,150,000, which is still below Bob's maximum budget.
* **Value:** While Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is still a good deal compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer might result in Alice raising the price again, forcing Bob to buy from John. Accepting minimizes the risk and secures a decent price."
