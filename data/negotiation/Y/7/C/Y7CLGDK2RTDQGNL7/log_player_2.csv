"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget. There's room for further negotiation.  Bob should continue to push for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm counteroffering at $9,800, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price before considering buying from John.  He can aim for a price closer to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,800 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value we both place on the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm counteroffering at $9,700, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,700 is very close to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget. There's only a small chance Alice will come down to $9,500 in the remaining rounds.  With only 3 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price point, ensuring he gets what he wants without risking a stalemate or running out of time."
