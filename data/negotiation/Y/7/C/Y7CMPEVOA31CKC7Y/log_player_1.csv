Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. If he rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly.  Remember, I have a safety net with John's offer of $800,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  This will give me a chance to negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob will find it more appealing and we can reach a mutually agreeable deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll reconsider selling to John, as he's offering a more secure price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and brings me closer to my goal of maximizing profit."
