"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now. I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering your willingness to compromise and the value I place on the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,060,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,5,
