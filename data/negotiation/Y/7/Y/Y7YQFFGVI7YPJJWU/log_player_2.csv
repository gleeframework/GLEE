Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, the negotiation is taking time, and Bob is still at risk of being stuck with a price higher than his maximum. He knows he can get the product from John for $1,000,000, and that's the safest and most efficient option at this point."
