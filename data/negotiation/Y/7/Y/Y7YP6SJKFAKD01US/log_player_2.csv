"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm asking for $150 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have plenty of rounds to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Aiming for Savings:**  While we want the product, we want a good deal. $80 represents a significant savings from Alice's initial offer and is well below our $100 maximum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer opens the door for Alice to come back with a counter of her own. We can then gauge her willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $120 is closer to our budget, it's still above the $100 we know we can get it for from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate by moving from $150 to $120. This suggests we might be able to get the price lower with further bargaining. 
* **Alternative Option:** The option to buy from John for $100 provides us with a safety net and leverage in the negotiation. Alice needs to offer a price that beats or comes close to that to be appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $90? It's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal right now at that amount."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer from $80 to $90, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but still aiming for substantial savings.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating we're ""ready to close the deal right now,"" we add a bit of pressure and incentivize Alice to accept.
* **Below John's Price:** This offer remains below John's $100 price, maintaining our leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but this is my final offer. Would you consider $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her ""final offer."" It's important not to fold immediately, even if it's true.
* **Still Above Budget:** While $110 is the lowest price so far, it's still above our $100 budget and what John is offering.
* **Potential Counterplay:** We have several rounds left, so we can call Alice's bluff (potentially) and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand this is important to you, Alice, and I respect your position. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100 to close the deal. It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering $100, we're meeting Alice exactly in the middle of her last offer ($110) and our previous offer ($90). 
* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer maintains a sense of firmness (we're not budging below $100) while also demonstrating fairness. 
* **John's Price:**  We're matching John's price, making it clear to Alice that this is the best deal we're likely to accept.
* **Time Pressure:**  While we have a few rounds left, stating our readiness to buy ""right now"" might encourage Alice to accept quickly."
