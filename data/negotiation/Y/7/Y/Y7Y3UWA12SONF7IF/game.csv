"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. My initial asking price is $1200000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000. This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $800000 is a decent offer, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950000. This price reflects the unique qualities and value I believe this product holds.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $900000?  This price is a good compromise and would allow us to both close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
