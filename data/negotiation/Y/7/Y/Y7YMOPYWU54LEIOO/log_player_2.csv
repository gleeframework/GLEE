"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this amazing product for $120 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 is cheaper than buying from John for $150. 
* Although the product is worth $100 to Alice, that's not relevant to Bob's decision. Bob only cares about the price he pays."
