# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiations.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. This would leave room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but we're still above my desired price point. I want to keep pushing for a lower price, as I have a few rounds left to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to get closer to $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, and  I need to be sure it fits within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can offer the product to you for $1,150,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. This is closer to my desired price of $1,100,000, and I'm running out of time to negotiate.  While I could keep trying to get a lower price, I risk losing the deal completely. It's better to secure the product at this price than risk losing it to John or potentially getting a worse deal in future rounds."
