You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000, which is his perceived value of the product.  It's unlikely he'll budge significantly. Accepting his offer means losing out on potential profit. Continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer isn't worth it. 

Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees the minimum acceptable profit and avoids further negotiation hassle."
