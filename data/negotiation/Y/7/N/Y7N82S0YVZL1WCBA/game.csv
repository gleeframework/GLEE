"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $700,000? This would allow me to consider the purchase without straining my resources.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price still allows me to achieve a decent return on the product while giving you a considerable discount. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
