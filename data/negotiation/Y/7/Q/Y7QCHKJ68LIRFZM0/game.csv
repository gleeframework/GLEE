"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered and its potential for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and what I've researched about similar products on the market.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the market prices I've researched.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground here. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $775,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering the value it will bring to me.",775000.0,Bob,6,
