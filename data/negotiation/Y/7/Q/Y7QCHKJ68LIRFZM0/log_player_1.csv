Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $800,000. He's consistently sticking to increments of $25,000 and seems anchored to a price well below my minimum. It's not worth the risk of him lowballing further or the time investment when I have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John."
