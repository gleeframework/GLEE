"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and provides you with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me. This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value to your company.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit above where I can go right now. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise, giving you a good profit while keeping the deal within my budget.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
