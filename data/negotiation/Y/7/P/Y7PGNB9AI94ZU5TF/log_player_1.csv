Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a strong price for me (Alice) while still leaving room for negotiation. It acknowledges the product's value to Bob while also giving him an incentive to negotiate. This strategy aims for a quick sale, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and provides you with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm not yet willing to sell for his price, but I want to continue the negotiation to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me. This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value to your company.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit above where I can go right now. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise, giving you a good profit while keeping the deal within my budget.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's significantly better than what John is offering and it's a good compromise with Bob. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
