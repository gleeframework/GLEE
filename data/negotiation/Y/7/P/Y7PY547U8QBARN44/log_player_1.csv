Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not excessively so. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price, but I'm willing to come down a bit to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's counteroffers are getting too low, and it's clear he's not willing to meet my minimum price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value for the product, and I don't want to risk losing that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
