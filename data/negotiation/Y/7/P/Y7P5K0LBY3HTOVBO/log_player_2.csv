"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is trying to convince him it's a good deal, it's still more than his maximum budget. He can get the same product from John for a lower price."
