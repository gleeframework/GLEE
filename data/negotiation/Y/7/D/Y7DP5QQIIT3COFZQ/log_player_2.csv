# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be a game-changer for you. Given its value to your business, I'm offering it to you at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects both its potential and my investment. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what Bob wants to pay.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is still willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to secure a lower price."
