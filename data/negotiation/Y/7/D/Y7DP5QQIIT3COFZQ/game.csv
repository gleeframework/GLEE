"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm looking to invest in this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price aligns with my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
