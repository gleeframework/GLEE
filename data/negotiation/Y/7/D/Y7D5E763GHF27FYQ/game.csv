"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This still gives you a significant discount, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
