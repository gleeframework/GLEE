"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting an initial offer that's far from your target price. This allows you to initiate the negotiation process and hopefully bring the price down closer to your acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting by offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to pay. This establishes a clear lower bound and puts pressure on Alice to compromise. It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for a more reasonable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my desired budget. I'll continue to reject offers and counter-offer until we reach a more agreeable price. I have several rounds to work with, and I'm not in a rush to commit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am still willing to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to my target, but I'm willing to compromise as long as the final price is below $1,500,000.  By moving closer to her price, I'm increasing the chances of reaching a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my preferred price point, but we're getting closer. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price within my budget.  I'm not ready to commit to $1,600,000 just yet, and I believe there's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to Alice's offer, but I'm still holding firm on my position of keeping the price below $1,500,000. I believe a price of $1,400,000 is a fair compromise, as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable amount for me to pay. This counteroffer should make Alice realize that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I've shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a lower price, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still aiming for a price below $1,450,000. This small increase demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a firm position. Hopefully, this small move will push Alice towards accepting my offer in the next round."
