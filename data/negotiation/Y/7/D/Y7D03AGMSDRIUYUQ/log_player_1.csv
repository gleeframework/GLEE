"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for room to negotiate. It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I have a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to get closer to my desired value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my desired value, I believe I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to counter at $1,600,000. This is another compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  It's getting late in the negotiation, so I need to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a little higher. I still have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter at $1,450,000. This is a small step up from Bob's offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to get him to accept. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not sure if I can get Bob to budge much higher.  I'm comfortable with John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm confident that I've made a good decision."
