Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $800,000 is too low for me, even though it's a significant amount of money. I still have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is just too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you've had a chance to fully consider it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
