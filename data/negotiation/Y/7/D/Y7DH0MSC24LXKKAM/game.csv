"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity to gain a competitive advantage. Please consider my offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
