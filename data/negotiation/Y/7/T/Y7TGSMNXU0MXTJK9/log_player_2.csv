"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $110, which is still above Bob's maximum value.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob has room to negotiate and should try to get a better price. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit above my budget.  How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but still secure the product. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is offering a price closer to Alice's value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. A $5 difference shows a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I really think this product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still secure the product. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $108, which is still within Bob's maximum value ($120) but is a significant improvement from the initial offer of $110.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might become unwilling to sell or stick to a higher price. 

Given the potential for Alice to become inflexible or for the negotiations to drag on, it's a good strategy for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
