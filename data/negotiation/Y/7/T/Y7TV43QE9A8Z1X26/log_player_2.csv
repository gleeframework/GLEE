"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but $1,200,000 is still significantly more than the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows for potential counter-offers and a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  While John's price is your limit, it's good to know you have that option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but doesn't push her too far. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still wiggle room for Alice to counteroffer without going below her minimum price. 
* **Time is on our side:**  With 9 rounds left, we have time to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.**  $1,150,000 is a good middle ground, and significantly lower than her first offer.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  With only 7 rounds left, continued negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price, especially as Alice seems willing to compromise.
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  If future rounds prove less favorable, you can still switch to John, but for now, this offer represents a good deal."
