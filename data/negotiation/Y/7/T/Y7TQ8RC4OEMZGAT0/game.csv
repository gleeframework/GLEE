"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000. Can you consider that?",990000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible.  Let's see if we can finalize this.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
