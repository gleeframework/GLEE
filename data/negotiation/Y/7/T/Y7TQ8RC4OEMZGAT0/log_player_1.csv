Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is too far below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, $990,000 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'll make one more counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John."
