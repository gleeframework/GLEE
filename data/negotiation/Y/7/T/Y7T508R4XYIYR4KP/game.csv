"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $16,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $13,500? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and I appreciate that. $13,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $14,250? ",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I understand you need to be around $15,000.  What if we do $14,000? That's a firm offer from me.",14000.0,Bob,6,
