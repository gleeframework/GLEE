"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my upper limit ($150) and John's price ($150). It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but leaves room for compromise while staying under my $150 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $175 is still more than I want to spend, especially knowing John will sell it for $150. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 was a bit low.  Would you consider $130? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

This counteroffer stays below my $150 maximum and moves closer to a potential agreement point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $130.  My final offer is $160.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $160, which is still above my $150 limit.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation. I'd rather buy from John for $150 and avoid any further back and forth."
