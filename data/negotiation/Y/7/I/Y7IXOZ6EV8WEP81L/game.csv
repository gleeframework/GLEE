"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. My initial asking price is $1,750,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is limited to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm eager to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still more than I can afford.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for me.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still not enough for me to part with this product.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing a final price of $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget and the value I'm placing on this asset.  I'm confident this price makes sense for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a significant step closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to have to stick to my original offer of $1,000,000.  I understand this is a significant discount for you, but it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
