"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. My initial asking price is $1,750,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is limited to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm eager to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still outside of my budget.  I will counteroffer again to try and find a compromise closer to my $1,000,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still more than I can afford.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still not enough for me to part with this product.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing a final price of $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget and the value I'm placing on this asset.  I'm confident this price makes sense for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my $1,000,000 limit.  I'll make one final counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I'll purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a significant step closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to have to stick to my original offer of $1,000,000.  I understand this is a significant discount for you, but it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
