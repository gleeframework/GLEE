# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you would be very interested in. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,150,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, but still higher than my maximum budget.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm happy to accept $1,100,000. This seems like a fair compromise given the value to both of us.
