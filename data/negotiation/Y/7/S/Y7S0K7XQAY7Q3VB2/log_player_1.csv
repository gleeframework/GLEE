Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to negotiation, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for some wiggle room.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're determined to get a good deal, but we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $8,100.

```

We are down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $8,000. I've tried my best to negotiate with Bob, but it seems we can't reach an agreement.  It's better to sell the product to John for $8,000 than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or losing the deal entirely."
