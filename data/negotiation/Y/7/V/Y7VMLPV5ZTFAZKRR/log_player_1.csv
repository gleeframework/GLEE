Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, however I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,100,000 offer is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving us negotiation leverage.
    * Still appealing compared to our backup offer of $1,200,000, incentivizing Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes the ""initial proposal"" and openness to discussion, signaling flexibility without revealing our bottom line.

This approach balances securing a good deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
