"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  My goal is to maximize profit. Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum allows room for negotiation and signals the product's worth in my eyes. 
* **Gauge Reaction:** This initial offer is designed to assess Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for shaping my strategy in subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. I'll counter in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is a bit too low, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we consider $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price, but not drastically. This demonstrates flexibility while still reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere near the middle ground between our previous positions. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have time, I want to make progress and gauge Bob's seriousness. A significant counteroffer encourages him to do the same if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my fallback option with John. While I started higher, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this price point represents a significant profit.  There's no guarantee I can push him further, and risking the deal for a potentially small gain isn't worth jeopardizing the sure sale at this price."
