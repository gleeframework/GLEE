"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to the value, I can't accept a price that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while still reflecting the true worth of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for moving towards a compromise. That said, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I could potentially stretch to $1,350,000, but that's really the absolute limit of my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
