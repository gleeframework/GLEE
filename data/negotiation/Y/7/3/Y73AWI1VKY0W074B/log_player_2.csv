Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Bob should buy from John. Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's maximum price.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and John offers a better deal."
