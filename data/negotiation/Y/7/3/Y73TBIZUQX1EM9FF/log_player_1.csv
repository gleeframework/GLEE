This is a starting point. I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm also aware of the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  We'll see how he responds and then adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to try and push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 135}

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'm still not ready to sell for $125. It's closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to try and push for a price closer to $135."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is firm on $125, and I've already made several concessions.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's clear that further negotiation won't get me there.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the most sensible decision to sell to him."
