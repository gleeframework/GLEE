Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, but $825,000 is still too high. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. It's worth pushing for another round of negotiation before considering John's offer or accepting Alice's current price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal. We've been back and forth, and I think I can get her to come down a bit more. We still have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price without resorting to John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $800,000. This is the midpoint between Alice's last offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to meet halfway and signals my seriousness about closing the deal.  We're running out of rounds, so this is a good compromise to avoid having to purchase from John."
