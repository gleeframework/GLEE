Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters and gives me some leverage to potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I believe I can do better, so I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate, but also ensuring I get closer to my desired price.  This leaves room for a final agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It seems like further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price and guaranteeing a successful transaction."
