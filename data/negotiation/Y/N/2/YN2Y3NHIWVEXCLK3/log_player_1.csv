Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a chance to acquire it at a significant discount compared to its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** We start with a price of $1,350,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but significantly lower than your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant discount,"" aiming to frame the price as a bargain even though it's above Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the chance to still secure a price higher than $1,200,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits beyond his product valuation.
* You are balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and selling to John at your minimum) with the potential reward of Bob accepting a higher price."
