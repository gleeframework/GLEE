Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but not so high that it seems unreasonable. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

$120 is still a good price, but I'd like to see if I can get a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

```

Bob is sticking to his $120 offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to $135,  $120 is still a good price and better than selling to John for $100. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
