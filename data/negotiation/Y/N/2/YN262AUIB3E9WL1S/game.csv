"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth $20,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is fair for both of us. Let's make a deal!",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $15,000. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident it's a deal that we can both agree on. Let's close this deal and move on!",15000.0,Bob,4,
