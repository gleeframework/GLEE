Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm not going to accept Bob's lowball offer just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $775,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still not sure that's the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price."
