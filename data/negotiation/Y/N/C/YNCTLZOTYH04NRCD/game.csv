"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
