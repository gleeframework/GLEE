"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks good, but  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that you'll find it a great value at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
