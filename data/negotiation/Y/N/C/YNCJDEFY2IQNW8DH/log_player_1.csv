Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. It offers incredible value, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our $1,500,000 goal.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000.

This approach balances risk and reward by aiming for a high price with Bob while having the security of a backup buyer."
