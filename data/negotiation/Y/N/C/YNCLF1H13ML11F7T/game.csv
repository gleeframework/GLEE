"I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep, but I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the original price. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000 is too high, but $980000 is more reasonable. Let's meet in the middle of that, at $1015000. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
