Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. It's a great deal for something of this quality."",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high (e.g., $300) will likely make Bob immediately walk away. $175 is a reasonable markup that Bob might still consider.
* **Highlighting Value:** Instead of just stating the price, the message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the price in Bob's mind. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chance of Bob accepting the offer. If Bob rejects the offer, we still have John as a backup buyer at our minimum acceptable price."
