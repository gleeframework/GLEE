"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it has the potential to be worth significantly more than $1200000 to the right buyer, and I'm confident that you're that buyer.  To show my confidence in its value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the potential upside, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product has potential, it's not worth risking overspending. It's better to reject her offer and secure the product from John for a lower price."
