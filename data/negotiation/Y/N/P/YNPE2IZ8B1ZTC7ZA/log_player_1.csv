Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,300,000. I believe it presents a unique value proposition and would be a valuable asset to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer that's favorable to you. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Phrases like ""unique value proposition"" and ""valuable asset"" subtly emphasize the product's worth to Bob, potentially making him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering a price below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but well above your minimum ($800,000), there's a good chance he'll counter-offer, and you can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant move in the right direction, but it's still below the midpoint between your initial offer and his perceived value. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,275,000?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Starting with ""I appreciate your counteroffer"" helps maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Compromise:**  This offer shows you're willing to move closer to Bob's price, but you're still holding out for a significantly higher amount than his counteroffer.
* **Strong Position:** We're still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I am open to negotiations, I would like to stick closer to my initial budget. Would it be possible to consider $1,250,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,250,000 is a strong profit, exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) by a significant margin. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to your offers, indicating a willingness to make a deal. Accepting now prevents the risk of him walking away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  It's generally better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a slightly better one."
