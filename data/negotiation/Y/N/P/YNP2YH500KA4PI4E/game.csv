"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at this price point.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet your asking price of $1,100,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,4,
