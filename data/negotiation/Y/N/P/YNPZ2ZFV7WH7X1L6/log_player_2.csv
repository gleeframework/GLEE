"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. How about we set the price at $12,250?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

Alice is consistently moving towards a middle ground.  At $12,250, the price is reasonable, and further haggling might make us lose the deal. It's better to secure the product at a good price now."
