"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come up with a fair price of $100 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum acceptable price, I can sell the product to John for the same amount without further negotiation. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $100 from John and save time and effort."
