Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finally meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  She's gone back up to her original offer of $12,000 and seems stuck. It's unlikely she'll move much lower.  While buying from John at $15,000 isn't ideal, it's better than getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
