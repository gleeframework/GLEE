Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob has met my baseline price. It's always possible to try for more in future negotiations, but accepting a sure thing at this point is a good business decision."
