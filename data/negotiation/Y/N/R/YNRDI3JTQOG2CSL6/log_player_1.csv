Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $12,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
