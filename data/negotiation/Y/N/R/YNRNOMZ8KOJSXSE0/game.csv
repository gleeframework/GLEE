"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we discuss $990,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe that's a fair price for the product.",990000.0,Bob,4,
