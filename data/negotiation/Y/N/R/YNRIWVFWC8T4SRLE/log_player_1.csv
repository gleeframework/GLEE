Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  This offer allows for potential profit while still respecting your minimum value of $12,000. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you are serious about selling the product, but also willing to negotiate.

Remember, you can always use your knowledge of John's offer to guide your negotiation strategy. If Bob rejects your offer, you'll have to decide whether to counteroffer or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm confident I can find a better deal elsewhere, but I'd like to work with you if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than your minimum. You have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and see if you can negotiate a better price.  You can try to meet in the middle, or even use John's offer as leverage to push Bob closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go as low as $9,000.  Given the value of the product and the market, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Meet halfway:** $10,500 is halfway between your last offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). 
* **Maintain some profit:** It still allows you to make a profit, even though it's below your ideal price. 
* **Stay above your minimum:** This offer remains above your minimum value of $12,000, so you're not taking a loss. 

By being flexible but firm, you're showing Bob that you're serious about selling but also willing to compromise. This could lead to a faster resolution and ultimately a sale closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to your minimum acceptable price and a good deal considering your guaranteed sale with John for $12,000. Accepting this offer would provide a good profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
