"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm confident I can find a better deal elsewhere, but I'd like to work with you if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go as low as $9,000.  Given the value of the product and the market, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
