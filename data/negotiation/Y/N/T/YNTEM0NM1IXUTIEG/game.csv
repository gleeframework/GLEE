"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Based on my understanding of its potential, I'm asking for $1800000.

"Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1000000 is below my desired value for the product, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to reduce the price to $1400000. This figure acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the inherent value of this unique opportunity. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  To move forward, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
