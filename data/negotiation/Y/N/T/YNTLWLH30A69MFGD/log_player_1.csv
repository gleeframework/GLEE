"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to establish a favorable anchor point. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone is important to maintain a positive negotiating environment. We want to encourage Bob's engagement without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to participate actively in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below our target and leaves a large portion of potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate and believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. 

We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round, demonstrating flexibility while still striving for a higher selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While your initial offer is quite a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,000,000) and our previous asking price ($1,300,000) but leans slightly more towards our desired outcome. 
* **Justification:** We're not just throwing out a number; we're reiterating the ""true value"" to reinforce the product's worth.
* **Encouraging a Deal:**  The language implies we're serious about closing a deal and are willing to negotiate reasonably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a genuine interest in the product. However, the gap between his current offer ($1,100,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) is still significant enough to warrant further negotiation. We're not in a rush, and there's still room to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,150,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while ensuring a fair deal for both parties.  I believe this is a compelling offer, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a smaller concession ($25,000) this round to signal we're nearing our bottom line while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** By repeatedly highlighting a ""fair deal,"" we aim to frame the negotiation as mutually beneficial and encourage Bob to accept a price closer to our desired range. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):** Mentioning ""closing the deal at this price"" introduces a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
