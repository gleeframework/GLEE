"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to start with a price of $8,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see the value you place on the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. Is this a more comfortable price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. There's room for more negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate that.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Is this a price you're willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. He's already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that Alice will go lower. It's time to cut his losses and go with the sure thing of buying from John."
