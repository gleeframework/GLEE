"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to start with a price of $8000. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see the value you place on the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate that.  However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Is this a price you're willing to accept?",12000.0,Alice,5,
