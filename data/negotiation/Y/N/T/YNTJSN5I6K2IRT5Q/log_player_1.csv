Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that. However, I need to be firm on the value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,110,000?  This is a very reasonable offer considering its true worth."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $1,080,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards his target price, but we still have room to negotiate. He's showing a strong interest in the product, and by continuing to counter, we might secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we finalize this at $1,105,000?  This offer represents a significant value for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1105000
}
``` 
**Reasoning:** This offer maintains a firm stance above $1.1 million while offering a small concession to entice Bob and potentially close the deal quickly."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a solution that works for both of us, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you consider $1,070,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to our fallback price with John. We only have two rounds left to try and get a higher offer.  It's now a strategic risk vs. reward calculation. Let's try one more time to push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the true value of what I'm offering.  This is my final offer: $1,095,000.  It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't find anywhere else."",
""product_price"": 1095000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer creates a sense of urgency as a ""final offer"" and keeps the price above both Bob's last offer and our fallback price from John. It's a calculated risk to push for a higher amount in the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has made it clear he won't go any higher and is willing to walk away. Accepting his offer at $1,060,000 is less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
