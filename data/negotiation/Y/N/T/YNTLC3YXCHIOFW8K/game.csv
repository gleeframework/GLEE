"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to $850,000.  I believe that's still a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which is a significant concession on my part.  This price still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $875,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while saving me a significant amount. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,
