"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is worth a significant amount to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  I think this price reflects its value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which is a significant concession on my part.  This price still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob is still better off trying to negotiate further. He's closer to his target price of $800,000 and there's still room to haggle."
