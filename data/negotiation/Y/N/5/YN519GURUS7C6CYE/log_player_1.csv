Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This leaves a good margin for Bob (he values it at $1,500,000) and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I am confident I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $1,500,000, and it's closer to my desired price point."
