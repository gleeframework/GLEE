"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which holds immense value, for a price that reflects its potential. I believe $1500000 is a fair starting point, considering its worth to me. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.
