{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is a good compromise.  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and I don't want to risk losing this sale completely. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.  Plus, with John as a backup option, I'm not in a desperate position."
