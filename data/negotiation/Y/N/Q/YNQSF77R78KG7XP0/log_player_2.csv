# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$150 is way above your budget. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit high, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$125 is still over your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price.  You have 7 rounds left and it's better to try and get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $95 right now."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is closer to your budget, it's still above your target. You have several rounds left and it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  You're getting closer to a deal, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm really pushing my limits here, but I can only go up to $105. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting very close to your budget, but it's still worthwhile to try and get closer to your target. You've shown your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate, and you have 3 rounds left.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since you've already demonstrated you're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm really pushing my limits here, but I can only go up to $100. It's my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

# Alice's message: I understand you're at your limit, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise one last time and meet you at $108. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're close, but Alice's final offer is still above your budget and you're in your last round. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John, which is within your budget."
