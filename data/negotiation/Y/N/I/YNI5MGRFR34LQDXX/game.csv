"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  $10,500 is still a little high for my budget. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,250. Would that work for you?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,250 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,7,
