Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob while acknowledging his perspective.  This sets a positive tone and encourages him to consider the offer. 

**Important Note:**

This strategy balances maximizing profit with potentially securing a sale quickly.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and/or move on to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. It's better to reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price. While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm still motivated to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $10,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Message:**  I'm again emphasizing the value proposition for Bob while acknowledging his initial offer.  This keeps the communication open and positive. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
