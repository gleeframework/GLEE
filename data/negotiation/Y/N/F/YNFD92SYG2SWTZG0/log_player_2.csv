"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am proposing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a piece that truly exceeds expectations. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is quite high ($9,500). While she claims the product is valued at $10,000 to me, I know it's only worth a maximum of $10,000 to me.  By rejecting her offer, I can try to get a better deal from John, who is offering the product for $10,000. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a lower price, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal to potentially save some money."
