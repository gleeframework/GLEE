# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above my desired price range. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a lower price. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and leaves some room for us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still believe the product's value is higher. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your willingness to negotiate.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. Since we have several rounds left and Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate, I'll reject her offer and continue trying to lower the price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my desired price, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I have several rounds left, and it seems she's ready to keep negotiating. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,280,000? This is a fair price that's in line with our previous discussions, and allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a slightly lower price, Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is very close to my desired price and a fair compromise.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better offer.  Accepting this offer secures the product and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
