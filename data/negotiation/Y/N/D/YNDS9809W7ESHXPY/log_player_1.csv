Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position and allows for negotiation room. I'm aiming for the best possible price while still remaining open to compromise. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and my initial offer. I need to try and push for a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product is worth more than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'm getting closer to his desired price, I'm not yet satisfied. I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000.  This is a further compromise from my previous offer but still reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this is a fair price and a good compromise point.  If Bob still rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
