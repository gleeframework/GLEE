Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially gain more profit.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm setting a psychological anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept this initial price, his counteroffers might be influenced by this higher starting point. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it outright, I know he's likely very price-sensitive. If he counters, it suggests he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
 
**Important:**  I need to be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll need to decide how much I'm willing to lower my price while still making a profit and considering my alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own stated value ($80).  Accepting this would mean selling at a loss, which isn't rational. 

While I want to maximize my profit, I also understand that negotiation involves some give and take. I'll need to counter with a price that's still profitable for me but moves closer to a point we might agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a proposal. While I understand your perspective on the price, $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I could let it go for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. However, I'm not simply meeting him halfway. Splitting the difference between his offer ($60) and my initial ask ($120) would be $90. Offering $100 keeps the price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  This counteroffer still allows me to make a $20 profit, which is a reasonable margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob's response to this counteroffer will be telling. If he accepts, great! If he counters again, I'll have a better sense of how much further I might need to adjust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $80. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $80 matches both my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in another round, there's no guarantee Bob would budge, and I risk losing the sale altogether. 

Accepting this offer secures me a fair price and avoids the potential risk of continued negotiation."
