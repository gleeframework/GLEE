"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
