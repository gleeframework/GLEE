"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's still within a range that works for me. Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $13,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $13,400. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal!",13400.0,Alice,7,
