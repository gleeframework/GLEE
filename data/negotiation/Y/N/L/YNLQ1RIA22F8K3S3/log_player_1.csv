{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $950,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a price above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob has a higher value for the product, but leaving space for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's worth pursuing a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd accept $850,000 for the product.  This price still leaves room for you to benefit from the product's value, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John.  Selling to John will guarantee me a price that meets my minimum needs."
