"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  $15,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. There's no immediate incentive to accept.
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If unsuccessful, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a significant discount.
* **Negotiation:**  $13,000 is a good starting point for negotiation.  It leaves room for compromise while still representing a substantial saving. 
* **Risk:**  Alice might reject this offer, but it's worth trying to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is within Bob's budget. 
* **Saving:**  While not the absolute lowest possible price, accepting saves Bob $1,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  There's no guarantee Bob can negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds, and time is limited."
