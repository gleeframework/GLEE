Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** The $1,350,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states openness to discussion, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage.

This strategy balances securing a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  If Bob declines, the guaranteed sale to John ensures I still meet my minimum acceptable price."
