"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still a far cry from the $15,000 I initially offered.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to settle for that price just yet.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.  Hopefully, this will be enough to encourage him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can push for a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer.  If he rejects it, I'll start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting frustratingly close to my minimum price. While $11,000 is not bad, I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and forcing me to accept John's offer, which would be my absolute minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiation."
