Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $11,000?  That's still a great price for a product that's worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but we're still $200 apart. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
