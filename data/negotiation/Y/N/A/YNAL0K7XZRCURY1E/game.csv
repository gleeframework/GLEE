"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for closer to $15,000, but that's still a bit out of my price range. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is a good middle ground between our offers. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm trying to be mindful of my spending, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers at $11,750? I think this would be a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!",11750.0,Alice,7,
