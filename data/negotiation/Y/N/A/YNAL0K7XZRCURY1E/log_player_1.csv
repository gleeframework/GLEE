"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price ($15,000) as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for closer to $15,000, but that's still a bit out of my price range. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum price, but I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I'll counteroffer again and try to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is a good middle ground between our offers. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm trying to be mindful of my spending, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I still want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers at $11,750? I think this would be a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11750}
