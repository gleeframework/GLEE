You've made a few counteroffers, and Alice hasn't budged much. You only have a few rounds left.  At this point, it's best to  buy from John for $80 and save the time and effort of continuing to negotiate. You've already established a good baseline with John, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to your price."
