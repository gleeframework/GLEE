"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay somewhere around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, $16,000 is a bit high.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, my final offer. This product is really worth it, and I think you'll be very happy with it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. That's closer to what I had in mind. How about $12,500?  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
