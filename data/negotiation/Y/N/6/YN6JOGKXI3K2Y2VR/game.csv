"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 might still be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer it to you for $12,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come up a little bit, how about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad you're willing to come up a bit, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer it to you for $12,875. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",12875.0,Alice,7,
