Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still allows me to make a profit. I believe this is a fair price, considering that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob. If he rejects the offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I will also keep John in mind as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $12,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this price will be acceptable to him, but if not, I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm concerned that we may not reach an agreement. John is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, which is a much better outcome for me. Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
