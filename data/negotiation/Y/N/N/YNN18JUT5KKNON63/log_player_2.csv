"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me.  I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product,  considering its value to me. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's keep the conversation going! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than I'm willing to go right now. While it's closer to my target, I still have some room to negotiate. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,050,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the deal to avoid further negotiations and potentially losing the product to John.  While I'd prefer to pay less, $1,075,000 is still a good price considering the product's value to me."
