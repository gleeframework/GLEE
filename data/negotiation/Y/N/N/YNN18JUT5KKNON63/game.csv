"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value I'm offering.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product,  considering its value to me. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's keep the conversation going!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement.
