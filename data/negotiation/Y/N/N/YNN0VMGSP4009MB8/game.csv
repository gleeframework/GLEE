"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $8,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $8,000 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
