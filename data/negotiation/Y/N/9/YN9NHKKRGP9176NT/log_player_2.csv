Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $7,800. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm eager to finalize the sale and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800

``` 

This is a good deal for you, Bob! While you could try to haggle Alice down further, you risk her increasing the price or you running out of rounds.  $7,800 is a significant savings from her original offer and a better deal than John is offering."
