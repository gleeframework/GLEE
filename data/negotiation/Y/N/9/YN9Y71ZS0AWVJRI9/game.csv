"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this product.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $17,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $15,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,
