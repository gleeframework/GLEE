"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  While I understand your budget, the value of this product is considerably higher than that. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
