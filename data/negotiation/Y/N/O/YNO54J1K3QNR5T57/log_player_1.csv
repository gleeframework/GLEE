{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still allows for some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell it,  $9,500 is far below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to propose $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close to my minimum acceptable value. It's still a good deal for me considering the value of the product to Bob. It's also a good compromise, and I'm not sure how much more I can get out of him. Accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
