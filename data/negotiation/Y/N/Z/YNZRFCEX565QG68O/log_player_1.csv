Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $110 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still ensuring a significant profit for you (above your minimum of $80). 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering it at $120 might seem too aggressive and could lead to an immediate rejection. 

It's important to strike a balance between a price that's attractive to Bob and ensures you receive a good return on your product."
