"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it.  However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute limit. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to buy. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
