"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. After considering your valuation of $800,000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation while also ensuring I earn a reasonable profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
