"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9000?  I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
