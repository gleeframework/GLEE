Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than that. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John at my desired price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the potential for negotiation and the security of a backup buyer."
