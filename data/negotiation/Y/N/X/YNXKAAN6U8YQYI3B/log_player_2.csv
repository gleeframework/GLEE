"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price and potentially save more."

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $925,000 is better than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push Alice closer to his counteroffer of $850,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is still a good profit margin for me, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.**  At $912,500, the price is significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much better price.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but she's also firm on her bottom line. Pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob a significant amount of money.**  By accepting, Bob saves $287,500 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are likely to be minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal. It's a good time for Bob to accept and secure the product at a favorable price."
