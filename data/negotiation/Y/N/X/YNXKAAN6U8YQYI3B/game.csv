"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $887,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know what you think.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is still a good profit margin for me, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
