"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, and considering its value, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. Would you like to start by making an offer?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $80, but let's aim for a compromise. How about we agree on a price of $95 for the product? This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while providing you with a good deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $85. This would give you a good profit and still allow me to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To further explore this opportunity, how about we settle on a price of $90 for the product? This still provides a decent profit margin for me, while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",90.0,Alice,5,
