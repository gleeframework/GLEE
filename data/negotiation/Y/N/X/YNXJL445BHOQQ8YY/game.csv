"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. How about we meet at $170? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",170.0,Alice,3,
