(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and is still within my budget.  I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,380,000 is still too high, but closer to my limit.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter again, aiming for a price closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and is closer to Alice's latest price. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Alice to accept. If she rejects, I'll likely move closer to my maximum limit in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is only $50,000 above my maximum limit of $1,300,000. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John at $1,200,000 is too high. It's in my best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that is just slightly higher than my preferred limit."
