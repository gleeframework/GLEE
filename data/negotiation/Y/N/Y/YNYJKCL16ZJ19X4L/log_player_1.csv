"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $150 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation. This signals that I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Building rapport:** I'm starting with a friendly message to establish a positive tone."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, I'm not in a rush and I believe I can get closer to my ideal price. Bob has shown interest and acknowledged the value of the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and meet at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a fair price. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a great deal at $105, as the product is worth $150 to him.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is very close to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John for $80. I'm willing to take this offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
