Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting low, at $50, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still within my budget."

$125 is still too high. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll counteroffer again, but if she rejects, I'll just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice is being stubborn. At this point, it's better to just go with John's offer.  I'm saving $10 compared to Alice's last offer, and I'm still getting the product within my budget."
