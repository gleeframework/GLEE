Alice's offer is still higher than your budget. It's better to try and negotiate further, as buying from John would still be cheaper."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $155 is still higher than your maximum budget of $120. Even though you're close to a deal, it's better to take the guaranteed price from John at $120."
