"Alice, thank you for the offer! I appreciate you taking the time to showcase the product. While I see its value, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This feels like a good middle ground that respects both of our positions.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a middle ground, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
