"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired value ($175) because I know Bob values it at $100. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is clearly interested, so there's room for more negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $150 is tempting, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $145.
* **Staying above minimum:** $145 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150), but it's still below it. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks dropping the price even lower.
* **Secure deal with John:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, providing a guaranteed deal. I can avoid further negotiation and potential losses."
