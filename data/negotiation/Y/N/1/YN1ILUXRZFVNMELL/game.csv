"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you consider it?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still less than what I could get from another buyer. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $102.50. Can you consider it?",102.5,Bob,4,
