{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this item that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $145. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $150.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $150. 

You start with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to entice Bob.  There's a chance he might accept $145, netting you more than his actual valuation. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything, as you'll sell to John at your minimum."
