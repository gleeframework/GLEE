Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This incentivizes Bob to accept rather than immediately counteroffer.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** If Bob counters, you have wiggle room to either accept or counter back without dropping below your minimum.

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's too far below your minimum. You can do better by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price. While $900,000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I'm open to a compromise. Let's split the difference - how about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
