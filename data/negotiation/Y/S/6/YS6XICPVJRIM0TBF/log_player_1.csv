Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $125, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which can be helpful in getting Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price, and I'd be better off selling to John for the same price.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** By rejecting, I can try to push Bob closer to my desired price.  
* **No Loss:**  Rejecting doesn't hurt me, as I have a guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference?  I can offer the product for $112.50.  Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in entirely. The counteroffer keeps some profit for myself. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $100, so this counteroffer is still better than that."
