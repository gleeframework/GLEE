"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1400000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's above your valuation.  Let's see if we can make this work!",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1250000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original valuation. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1300000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $1275000. It's a good compromise, and I believe we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not ready to accept $1275000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1290000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original valuation. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
