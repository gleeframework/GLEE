"Hi Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair price given the value I place on the product.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $131.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal!",131.0,Alice,5,
