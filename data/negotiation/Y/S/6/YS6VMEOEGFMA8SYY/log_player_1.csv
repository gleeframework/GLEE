{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair price given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $131.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 131}
