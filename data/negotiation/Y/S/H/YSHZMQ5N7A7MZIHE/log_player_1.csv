Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping we can reach a more favorable agreement."

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the negotiation with Bob seems to be going nowhere.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum, and avoids further rounds of negotiation that might result in an even lower price."
