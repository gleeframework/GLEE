"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This gives us both a fair price, and allows us to move forward. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but I'm still unable to go lower than $10,000.  This price is fair to both of us, considering the product's value.  I believe it's in both our best interests to close this deal.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
