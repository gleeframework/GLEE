"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $760,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I can meet you halfway from $825,000 to $760,000, but I need to make a bit more. I can offer you the product for $795,000. This is the best I can do.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I respect that.  I'm willing to go up a bit to $780,000.  Hopefully that works for you, as I'm getting close to my limit.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $780,000, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can make one final concession and offer you the product for $795,000, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Alice,7,
