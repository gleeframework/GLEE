Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $105 for it.  Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $100. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, making it the best option to ensure you don't overspend."
