"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $11,500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her product's worth to her, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door to securing a better deal."
