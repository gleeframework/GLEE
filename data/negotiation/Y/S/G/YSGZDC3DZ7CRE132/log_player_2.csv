"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both parties to find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,000, which is a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject any lower offers and he'll be forced to buy from John at $15,000.  At $11,000, Bob is still getting a good deal and saving $4,000 compared to buying from John."
