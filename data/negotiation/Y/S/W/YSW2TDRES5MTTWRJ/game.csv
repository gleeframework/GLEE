"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been highly valued by our previous customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if this offer suits your expectations.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product,  $200 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in making a deal, but I can only go up to $100 at this time. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $150. This is my final offer, as this is close to the cost price for me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $150 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if we can reach a deal at that price.",125.0,Bob,4,
