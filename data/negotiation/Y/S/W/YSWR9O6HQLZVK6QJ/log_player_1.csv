Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $12,000, I'm leaving a margin for negotiation. This increases the chances of a deal.
* **Not being too greedy:** I'm not starting at my minimum price ($15,000) because that could scare Bob off. 
* **Maintaining my minimum value:** Even if Bob makes a counteroffer, I have the option to reject it and sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a decent starting point for negotiation, it's still below my minimum price.
* **Potential for better deals:**  I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a significantly higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to maintain control. 

I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. How about $11,500? This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining profitable.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  $11,500 is still above Bob's estimated value, giving me some negotiating leverage.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** My message is positive and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer. This helps maintain a good relationship and increases the chances of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a satisfactory price:** Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and potentially lead to a lower price or even a failed deal.

While I could potentially get a higher price with John, the risk of a breakdown in negotiations with Bob is too high.  Accepting $11,000 is a good compromise and ensures a quick and profitable sale."
