"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10500 is still a little too low for me. How about $11500? This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
