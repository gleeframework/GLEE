"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm confident I can get a good price within the 10 rounds, but I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd love to get more, the risk of going through more rounds and potentially getting a worse offer from Bob, or having to sell to John for the same price, is not worth it.  Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum desired value and saves time."
