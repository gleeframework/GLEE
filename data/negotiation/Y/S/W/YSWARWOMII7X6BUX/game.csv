"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer of $11000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we try $12000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
