Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's value, giving me room for negotiation but still likely to be attractive to him. I'm open to discussing a lower price if he counters, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if it doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept an offer below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I can't go that low.  How about $115? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $112.50 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to risk further rounds and potentially lose more time and ultimately get a lower price. John is offering my minimum, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
