Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $150 offer from John gives me confidence to hold out for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I know I have a guaranteed $150 offer from John, which gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's split the difference and make this work."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to agree.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach, subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired $150, thanks to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  There's very little room left for negotiation.  Bob has already rejected two counteroffers, and it's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  With John offering a guaranteed $150, it's in my best interest to secure that sale.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that I might lose both deals."
