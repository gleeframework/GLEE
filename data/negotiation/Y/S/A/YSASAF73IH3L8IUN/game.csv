"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending under $100. Would you consider lowering the price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop the price to $125. This is still a good value for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, I would like to stick to my budget of $100. Could you possibly lower the price further?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $110 to make this deal happen.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's finalize this.",110.0,Alice,5,
