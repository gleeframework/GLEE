"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm confident we can find a figure that benefits us both. To start, I propose a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value you place on this product, my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the gap between $950,000 and my minimum price is still considerable. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my best offer. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, my budget constraints remain firm. I am now offering $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
