"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd prefer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still a chance I can get a better deal with Bob, and selling to John for $12,000 is always an option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with $10,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  It's also a significant jump from Bob's last offer, potentially motivating him to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll reassess my options and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than the previous round, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round.  We're already halfway through the negotiations, and I still have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, so there's no pressure to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $10,000. While this is still above Bob's offer, I'm trying to find a compromise that might be appealing to him. I'm getting closer to his offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, so I need to start making some concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to his own value of $8,000, which makes me worried he might not go higher. However, I'm still aiming for a higher price. While I'm losing some potential profit, I'm not willing to accept an offer so far below my minimum just yet. There's still a chance for a better deal, and I have the backup offer from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a significant compromise, bringing me closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to meet him halfway and close the deal.  We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and I need to start making some concessions to ensure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to his valuation of $8,000.  It's likely that he won't budge much further.  Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, it's simply not worth risking another round of negotiation with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring a profit and maximizing my earnings."
