"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects a significant discount and a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $850,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget constraints.",825000.0,Bob,4,
