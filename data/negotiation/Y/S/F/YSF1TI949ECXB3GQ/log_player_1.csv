Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:**  This ensures you don't sell below your threshold. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value. You can likely get a better price, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects a significant discount and a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $850,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is still below your desired price, it's getting closer.  You can always try to negotiate further, but considering you have a backup offer from John for $1,000,000, accepting this offer from Bob is a safe and profitable choice.  It's important to weigh the potential risk of further negotiations against the certainty of this offer."
