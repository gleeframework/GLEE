{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be a bit closer to my asking price. How about $105? I'm still open to negotiating, but I'm confident this product is worth the value."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our back-and-forth, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about $108?  This allows me to make a small profit and ensures you get a great product.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to go up to $105 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between your needs and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough to be truly satisfying. It's time to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
