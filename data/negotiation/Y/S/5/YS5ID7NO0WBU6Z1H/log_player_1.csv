Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and suggests the product is a good fit for Bob. This helps build rapport and potentially increases his willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a high price. 
* I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I won't accept anything less than $150 (my minimum).
* If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate before making a counteroffer.
* The John option provides a safety net and gives me a bargaining chip if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there's room for a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to explore if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* If Bob continues to decline, I'll consider the John option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $120 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by dropping my price, but not by too much.  
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value for Bob by calling it a ""good deal"".
* **Strategic Price:**  $140 is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if this price point is acceptable to Bob. If not, I might need to reconsider the John option. 
* I'm aiming for a quick resolution, but I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering the value of the product and my budget, I am able to offer $130. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while also supporting your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Delay:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering could lead to further negotiation rounds, delaying the sale and possibly losing Bob as a buyer.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John guarantees $150, the negotiation with Bob is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of losing both buyers.

**Strategy:**

* By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and avoid the potential for prolonged negotiation. 
* Even though it's slightly below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the circumstances and the potential for further delays."
