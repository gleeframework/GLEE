# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is less than what it's worth to Alice, you know you can get a better deal from John for $8,000."
