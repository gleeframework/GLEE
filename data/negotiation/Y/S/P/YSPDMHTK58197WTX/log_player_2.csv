# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than your ideal price. You can get the product for $10 less by buying from John."
