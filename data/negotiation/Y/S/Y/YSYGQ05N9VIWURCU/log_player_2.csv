"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob can get the product for $100 from John, Alice's offer of $95 is a better deal.  It saves Bob $5 compared to buying from John.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer being rejected and potentially ending up paying more."
