"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you, while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's finalize this deal and make this a win-win situation for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $962,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.",962500.0,Bob,4,
