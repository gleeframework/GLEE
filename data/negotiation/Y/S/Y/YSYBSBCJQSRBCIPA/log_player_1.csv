Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  $950,000 is closer to my desired price but still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you, while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's finalize this deal and make this a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $962,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, $962,500 is a good deal considering John is only offering $800,000. It's a solid profit, and it's important to close the deal before I lose Bob's interest entirely."
