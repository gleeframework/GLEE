You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to try to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price."
