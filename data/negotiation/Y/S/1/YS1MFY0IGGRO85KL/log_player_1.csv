Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still holding firm on getting at least $85 for the product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is very close to my minimum price and a better deal than selling to John. I'll accept his offer to secure a sale."
