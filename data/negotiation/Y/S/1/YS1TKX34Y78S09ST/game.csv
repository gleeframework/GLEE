"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $12000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's value to me.",16500.0,Alice,3,
