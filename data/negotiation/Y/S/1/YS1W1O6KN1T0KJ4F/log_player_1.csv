Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without losing him to John (your backup buyer).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a substantial saving compared to his perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously.

**Why not higher?**

While you could try a higher price, you risk Bob rejecting the offer and going with a competitor or simply deciding he doesn't need the product that badly. This strategy balances risk and reward."
