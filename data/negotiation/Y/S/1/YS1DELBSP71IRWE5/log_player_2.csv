"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still above Alice's value for the product but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but am also trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $90?  Let's find a price we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to go up to $87. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise but still trying to stay below my maximum budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $88?  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is within my budget and very close to my desired price of $85.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the deal to avoid further negotiations and ensure I get the product.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the product to another buyer or simply running out of rounds before reaching an agreement."
