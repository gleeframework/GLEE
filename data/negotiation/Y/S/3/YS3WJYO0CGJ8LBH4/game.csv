"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $9,500 again? It's the best I can do.",9500.0,Bob,4,
