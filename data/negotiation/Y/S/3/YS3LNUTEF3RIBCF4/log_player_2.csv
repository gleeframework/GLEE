"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a competitive price considering the potential of this product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,500,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still allows for a good profit for me while giving you a chance to acquire a valuable asset. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the potential of your product, but $1,250,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably invest. My final offer is $1,100,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1100000 still undervalues the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1150000. This is a fair compromise that ensures both of us benefit from this deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's budget, but it's getting closer.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price, but he needs to be careful not to go too low and risk losing the deal.  He has a backup option with John, so he can afford to be a bit more assertive in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident this product has the potential to be very valuable.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
