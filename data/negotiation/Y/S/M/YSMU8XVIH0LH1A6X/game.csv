"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm on a tight budget and $850,000 is still a bit too high.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for a product worth so much to you.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further to get this deal done. How about $725,000?  That's my final offer.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $725,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $775,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,7,
