{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than $80, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm going to offer the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer for $105.  While I'd like to get closer to $120, we're already on round 4 and there's a risk of running out of rounds and having to sell to John for $80. This offer secures a decent profit for me and allows me to close the deal."
