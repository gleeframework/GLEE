"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value.  Let me know what you think!",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155, which I believe is fair given the value of the product. This would be my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $155, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $142.50. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to come down to $148.75.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer.",148.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $148.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $144.25. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",144.25,Bob,6,
