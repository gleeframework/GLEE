"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth every penny of its $100 price tag. Considering its quality and the satisfaction it promises, I kindly invite you to accept this offer. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to ask. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is enthusiastic, she's offering the product at her maximum value.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer over John's. By rejecting her offer, there might be a chance Alice will propose a lower price in a counter-offer."
