"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to anchor high initially. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness and potential budget. 
* **Justification:** While the price is above Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the product's ""unique benefits,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and expresses confidence in reaching a deal, indicating flexibility. 
 
This strategy allows us to gather information about Bob's position before making significant concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below both our valuation and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate and should aim higher. By rejecting, we signal that we believe the product is worth more while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from my initial valuation. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still above both our minimum and John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This framing attempts to create a sense of fairness while keeping the negotiation moving in a positive direction.

We are aiming to find a middle ground quickly, as we have a valuable alternative with John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed $1,000,000. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further. There's a risk Bob might not go higher, but we still have John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm ready to close this deal and believe the product is truly worth it. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear this is our final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Matching John's Offer:** We're meeting Bob at the exact price John is offering, signaling we have a strong alternative and won't go lower. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes closing the deal and reiterates the product's value.

This strategy aims to either secure a deal at John's price or provide clarity on whether Bob is willing to match it. If Bob rejects this, we'll know it's time to move on to John."
