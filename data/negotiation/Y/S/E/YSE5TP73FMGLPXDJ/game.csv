"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while still allowing me to earn a reasonable return. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could we consider $950,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your need for a budget-friendly price, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This price is fair, considering the value you'll gain from the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
