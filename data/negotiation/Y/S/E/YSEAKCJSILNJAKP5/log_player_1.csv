"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal for something worth so much to you! Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's perceived value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, suggesting a good deal for him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting an unrealistic price, leaving room for Bob to counter without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, hoping to leverage the remaining rounds and potentially push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but not hostile:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not closing the door completely.  I'm acknowledging his interest and proposing a compromise.
* **Appealing to logic and fairness:** I'm positioning $1,400,000 as a fair compromise, bridging the gap between our current positions. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value the product brings to his business, subtly increasing its perceived value in his mind. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to see the value of the product and move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I believe that I have more leverage by continuing the negotiation, as I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. However, $1,300,000 just isn't enough for me to let this opportunity go.  How about we split the difference at $1,350,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's need for a good deal and demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to his offer. 
* **Split the difference:**  This strategy is often seen as fair and can help break the impasse. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, subtly implying that there's a chance I might choose another buyer if we don't reach an agreement soon.

By offering a compromise and adding a touch of urgency, I aim to encourage Bob to accept my offer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to keep costs down. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I've shown flexibility and attempted to reach a compromise, Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly. 

With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a mutually agreeable price is high. To secure the best possible outcome and avoid further negotiation, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further rounds of negotiation."
