"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider if the risk of further negotiation is worth potentially losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer. I've moved down from my initial price, but it's still a decent profit. If I reject, I risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
