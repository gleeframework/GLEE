"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $1,200,000 right now.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay.  If we can't find a middle ground here, I'll need to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need you to meet me halfway here.  This product is a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident it will pay off for you. To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value this product offers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to seriously consider other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
