"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to get concerned that I might have to settle for John's offer if Bob continues to refuse."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my last counteroffer and Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also getting closer to the point where I might be better off taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's getting uncomfortably close to John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to seriously consider the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13200}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,200. This is a compromise between my last counteroffer and Bob's latest offer, but I'm getting increasingly nervous.  I'm starting to feel like I might need to accept John's offer if Bob continues to reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John.  We've gone through several rounds, and Bob's offers are getting progressively lower.  I'm concerned that if I continue to counteroffer, Bob may not be willing to budge further. I'm now only $2,600 above my minimum value, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
