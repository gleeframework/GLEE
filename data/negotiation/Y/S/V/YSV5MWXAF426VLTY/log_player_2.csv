It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since the product is worth the same amount to both of us. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's split the difference and make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good price considering my goal of saving as much money as possible.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation."
