**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging beyond $975,000.  It's clear that further negotiation with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his offer would mean a $225,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
