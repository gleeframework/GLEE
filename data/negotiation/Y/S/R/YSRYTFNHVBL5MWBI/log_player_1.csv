Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum selling price of $80.
* **Below Bob's value:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him a potential incentive to buy.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer and still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at your minimum price, it's worth exploring if you can get a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  This still gives you a great price and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That way, we can both feel good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $80 and still leaves you with a profit.  While $90 would be better, continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
