Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from the sale. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves a profit margin for Bob ($200,000) while securing a significant profit for you ($300,000) over your alternative sale to John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer quickly."
