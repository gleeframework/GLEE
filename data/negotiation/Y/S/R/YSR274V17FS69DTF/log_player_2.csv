"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price, given the value you placed on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
