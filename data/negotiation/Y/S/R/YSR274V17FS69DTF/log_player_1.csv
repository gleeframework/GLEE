Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price, given the value you placed on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
