"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay $100, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to go up to $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? I think that's a fair compromise.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $112.50. I'm thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. Can you meet me at $132.50?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to where I need to be. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $120. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's worth it for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a bit higher than my previous offers, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $138?",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really pushing my budget with $138.  If you're willing to accept $130, I'll take it. It's the very most I can offer.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart. However, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you in the middle at $135. If you're still interested, let me know, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",135.0,Alice,9,
