"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's worth countering in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your eagerness to proceed."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While we want to move closer to an agreement, dropping to Bob's offer directly would be conceding too much. This counteroffer keeps the price above our minimum while enticing Bob with a significant price reduction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is now a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and significantly closer to my initial ask. Continuing negotiations might not yield a much better outcome, and there's a risk of Bob lowering his offer further. Accepting now secures a good deal."
