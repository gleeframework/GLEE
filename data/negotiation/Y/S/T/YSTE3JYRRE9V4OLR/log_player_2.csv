"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's higher than its intrinsic value to you, while still ensuring a good return for me. I believe this offer strikes a balance between maximizing my earnings and providing you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500.  This would still be a profitable sale for you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure we're both satisfied, I propose a price of $13,500 for the product. This still allows for a significant profit margin for me while being more reasonable than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. This is a better price than John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation would only yield small savings. Therefore, accepting the offer is the best course of action."
