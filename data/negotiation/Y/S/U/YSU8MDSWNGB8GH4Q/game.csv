"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than $13,000.  Let's try to reach a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $13,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $17,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",17000.0,Alice,5,
