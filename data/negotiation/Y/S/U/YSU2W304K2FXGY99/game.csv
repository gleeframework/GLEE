"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm still willing to work with you. However, I think $8500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $9200? This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",9200.0,Alice,7,
