"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm happy to offer it to you for $900,000. This price still allows you to make a good profit, while also being fair for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
