"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $150.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $175, which would be $162.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think.",162.5,Alice,5,
