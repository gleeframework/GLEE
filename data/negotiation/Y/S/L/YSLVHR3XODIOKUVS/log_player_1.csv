"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm mentioning that it's an ""amazing product"" to emphasize its worth. 
* **First Offer:**  I'm not aiming for a quick deal at this point, but rather laying the groundwork for a potential negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum price of $150.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Bob is showing interest, and I believe there's room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 
* **More Rounds:** With 9 rounds left, I have time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise, which can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Motivating Language:** I'm using phrases like ""bridge the gap"" to suggest a willingness to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $150.
* **Strategic Patience:**  With several rounds remaining, I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't feel worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  How about we split the difference at $150?  This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my minimum price, so I'm presenting it as a final offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that he'll be ""happy with the product,"" emphasizing its worth.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a compromise that feels fair to both of us. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By stating this is my ""absolute lowest,"" I'm subtly implying that if he doesn't accept, he might miss out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are stubbornly staying below my minimum.
* **No Further Compromise:** I've already lowered my price to my absolute minimum. There's no room for further concessions without sacrificing my own profit.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a decent profit. It's a safer and faster option compared to continuing with Bob."
