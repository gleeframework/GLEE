Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it immediately."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 aims to significantly increase your profit if Bob accepts.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the benefit of securing it quickly, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above your minimum.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while acknowledging you have a fallback option with John."
