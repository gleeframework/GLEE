"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,200,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.

Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, that's irrelevant to your decision. Your goal is to save the most money, and Alice's offer allows you to do that."
