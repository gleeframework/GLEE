"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $100 to you. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $95 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore the possibility of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer than Alice's initial price. He's aiming to meet halfway, creating a starting point for further negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's aim for a middle ground. I propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise. It's better than his initial counteroffer of $85, and it's a better price than buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures a successful purchase within his desired price range."
