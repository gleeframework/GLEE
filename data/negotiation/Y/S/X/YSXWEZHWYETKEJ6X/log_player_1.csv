Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation or a straightforward acceptance if Bob is feeling agreeable.
* **Staying Below John's Offer:**  We know John will buy the product for $150.  Therefore, any price between $150 and what Bob is willing to pay is a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves a small window for him to potentially counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to $150."
