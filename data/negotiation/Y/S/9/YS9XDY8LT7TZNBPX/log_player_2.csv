"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to introduce you to this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm aiming to sell it for $16,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell, but $16,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by immediately establishing your maximum price. It's a significant difference from Alice's offer, but it's a starting point to see if she's willing to negotiate.  It also opens the door for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $13,000 is still outside your budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if she'll come down further. You have time and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer, but $13,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm serious about buying the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate while staying within your budget.  It's a reasonable increment that suggests you're actively trying to reach a deal.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price for both of us,"" which can appeal to Alice's sense of reason and make her more receptive to your offer.
* **Commitment:**  Stating that you're ""serious about buying the product"" adds pressure and makes Alice more likely to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $12,000 is the lowest I can go and still make this worthwhile for me.  Do we have a deal at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, $12,000 is still above your limit. You still have rounds to go, and you can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to buy the product today."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Offering $11,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying close to your budget.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  Reiterating ""fair price for both of us"" continues to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Stating you're ""ready to buy today"" adds pressure to close the deal, potentially making Alice more agreeable."
