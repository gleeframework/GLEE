"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident the product's value is closer to my initial price. How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
