"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can definitely get a better price than $120, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While you could try to negotiate further, $110 is a fair price and much better than John's $150.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
