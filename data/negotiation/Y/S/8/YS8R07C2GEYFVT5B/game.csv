"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a fair price. Let's discuss further!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This would allow us both to reach a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still significantly below what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $900000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I believe it's a price that we can both live with. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $900000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with, but I'm eager to reach a deal. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $925000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,5,
