"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring a fair return for my efforts. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
