# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $75,000 above Bob's maximum budget. This is a reasonable compromise, and Bob can still save a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might increase her price again or become less willing to negotiate. Accepting the offer ensures a deal and a decent saving."
