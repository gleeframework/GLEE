I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind the $1,000,000 safety net from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a compromise closer to the middle ground."

I'm reducing my price by $300,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but still remaining above Bob's initial offer. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and could lead to a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm going to counter again, but I'm not going to go any lower than $1,000,000. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."

Bob is getting close to my minimum, but I've already made my final offer and he rejected it. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
