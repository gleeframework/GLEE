"Alice,  while I appreciate the offer, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see that you're willing to go up to $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is closer to my initial offer. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. ",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",885000.0,Alice,5,
