"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still a significant amount more than you need to pay. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down further or proceed with John's offer as a fallback option."
