Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to me ($8,000), I hint that it's valuable by saying ""I believe it's worth at least $8,000"". This aims to anchor his perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed my minimum acceptable price from John.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level and potential for a higher profit margin."
