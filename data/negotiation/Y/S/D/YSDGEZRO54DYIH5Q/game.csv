"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and understand its value, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go down to $150 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While $160 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more savings. Could we possibly agree on $155 for the product?",155.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go down to $155 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $165. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",165.0,Alice,5,
