Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not too outrageous, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while still keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a good price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I haven't lost the opportunity to sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my bargaining position and keep the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and finding a mutually agreeable price. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The offer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $100.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices and potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go as low as $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, and I might end up selling for less than $100.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is my minimum.

While I would prefer to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing money outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal with Bob. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and a quick resolution."
