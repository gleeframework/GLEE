"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $14000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $16500 is the lowest I can go. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm still looking for $17000.",17000.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I'm getting close to my limits, Bob. I can do $16000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet at $16000."
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $16000 is the lowest I can go. I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal, but I'm not budging on the price. I'm still looking for $16000.",16000.0,Alice,5,,
