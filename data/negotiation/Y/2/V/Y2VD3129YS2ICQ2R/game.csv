,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $16500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15500 for it. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
