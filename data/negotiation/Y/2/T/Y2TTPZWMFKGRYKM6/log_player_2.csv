# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you.

You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal considering the value it brings to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a good price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $5."
