"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the value it brings while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, I believe.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a workable range, it's still a significant gap from what I have in mind. Let's try $1,250,000. This price reflects the value it brings while recognizing we're both making concessions to reach a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
