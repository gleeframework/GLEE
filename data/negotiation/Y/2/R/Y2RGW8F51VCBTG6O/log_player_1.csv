{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to get a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also frames the offer as beneficial to both of us, which can encourage Bob to be more receptive."
