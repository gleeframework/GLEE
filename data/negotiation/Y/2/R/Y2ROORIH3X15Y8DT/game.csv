"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to offer $900000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $900000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to consider a price of $1150000, which is closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this level.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. While $1150000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go to $1050000. I think this would be a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer of $1050000. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, and I'd like to propose a compromise at this level. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit away from $1100000.  To make this work, I'm willing to go to $1075000. This is my final offer. I believe it's fair and reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. I think we've been close, but I'm not ready to accept $1075000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering the product to you for $1080000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach a deal at this level.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
