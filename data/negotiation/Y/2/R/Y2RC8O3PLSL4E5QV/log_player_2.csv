Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $108. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $108. Accepting this offer gets you the product at a good price without risking the negotiation breaking down."
