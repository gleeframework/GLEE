Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'm happy to offer $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000 for the product. It's a unique item, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'll make a new offer of $11,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is not budging from her price, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation. It's better to secure the product from John at his lower price rather than risk losing the deal entirely with Alice."
