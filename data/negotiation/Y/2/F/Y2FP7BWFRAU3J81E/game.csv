"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go over $85.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to make a small profit. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm ready to close the deal at $87.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to let it go for that amount.",90.0,Alice,7,
