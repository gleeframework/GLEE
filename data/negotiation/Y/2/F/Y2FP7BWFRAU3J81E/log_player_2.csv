"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?

The product is worth $80 to Bob. Alice's offer of $120 is way too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price, $110 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's time to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go over $85.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to make a small profit. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $92.50 is still too high for Bob.  He's willing to pay $85, and John will sell him the product for $80. It's time to counteroffer again and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm ready to close the deal at $87.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to let it go for that amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $90 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's getting close, but it's clear that Alice isn't going to budge much further.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, it's in Bob's best interest to simply buy the product from John and save himself the hassle of further negotiation."
