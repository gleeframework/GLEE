Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're aiming for at least $12,000, so you have room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **It's a fair offer:** You're giving Bob a good price, but also giving yourself room to potentially make more.

Keep in mind, this is just the beginning of the negotiation. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your desire to either close the deal quickly or maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant distance from your desired price. You have a better option in John, who is willing to pay your minimum. However, it's worth exploring if you can get a better offer from Bob.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Sell to John:** This guarantees you your minimum profit.
* **Reject and Counter:**  You can try to push Bob closer to your target price with a counteroffer.

It's a gamble.  If you're confident you can get Bob to go higher, rejecting and counter-offering is the riskier, but potentially more profitable, option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Showing flexibility:** By lowering your price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You're leaving the door open for another counteroffer if Bob is still hesitant.

This counteroffer balances the need to earn a decent profit with the desire to close a deal.  You'll need to carefully consider Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum:** $8,800 is far below your desired price of $12,000, and even below your last counteroffer of $9,500. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures you receive your minimum desired amount, which is far more profitable than accepting Bob's current offer.

While you could continue negotiating with Bob, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer.  You're at a point where the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward. It's wiser to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
