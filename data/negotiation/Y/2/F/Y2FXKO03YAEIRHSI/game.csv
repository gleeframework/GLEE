"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you the product for $155. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $140. I can offer you the product for $147.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",147.5,Alice,5,
