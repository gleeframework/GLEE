Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
 ""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal selling price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, it indicates he's interested but wants to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:**  I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above his perceived value of $80, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Closer to Minimum:** While $90 is less than my initial ask, it's getting closer to my absolute minimum of $100. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further.
* **John as Leverage:** I'll use the offer from John ($100) as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
 ""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price, but not drastically.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** $105 is still slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my potential profit.
* **John as Implicit Leverage:** While I don't explicitly mention John, the fact that I'm not accepting $90 implies I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  While $95 isn't ideal, it's only $5 less than my guaranteed sale to John. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now avoids further hassle.
* **Profitable:** $95 is still a profit over Bob's perceived value and above my minimum acceptable price."
