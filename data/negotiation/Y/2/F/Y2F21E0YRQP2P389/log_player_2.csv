"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000.  There's a chance you could get Alice to lower her price further. By rejecting this offer, you can see if she'll come down closer to her product's value of $10,000."
