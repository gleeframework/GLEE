"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($120), it's still cheaper than buying from John ($150). 
* **You still get a deal:** You're getting the product for $140, which is less than your maximum budget of $150."
