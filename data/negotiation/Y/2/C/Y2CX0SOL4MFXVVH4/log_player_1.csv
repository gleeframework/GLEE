Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.
