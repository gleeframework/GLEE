"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is fair given the market value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a deal. I can offer you a price of $825,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is still fair considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm only comfortable going up to $780,000.  If you're agreeable, we can wrap this up today. What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $780,000. I can offer you a price of $802,500. This is my final concession, and I hope we can reach a deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,7,
