"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
