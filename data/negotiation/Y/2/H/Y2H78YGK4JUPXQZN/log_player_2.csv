"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose the specifics at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for a price of $1500000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find the value to be substantial. Please consider my offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to Alice, but she's asking for $1,500,000. That's a 50% markup. I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
