# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $90, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
