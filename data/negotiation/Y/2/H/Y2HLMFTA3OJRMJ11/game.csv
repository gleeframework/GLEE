"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and I think that's a more comfortable price for me.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your offer and my previous one, so I'll counter with $120. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $127. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $122. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",122.0,Bob,6,
