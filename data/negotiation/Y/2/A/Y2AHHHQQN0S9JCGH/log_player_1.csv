"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his offer is significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is still a good deal for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that this will be a more acceptable offer for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. However, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value just yet. I'll reject his offer and counter again in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway.  With only five rounds left, I need to close the deal, but I'm not willing to drop below $9,500."
