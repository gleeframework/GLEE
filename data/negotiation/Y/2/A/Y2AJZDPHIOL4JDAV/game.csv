"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the immense value it brings. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This would give you a good profit and still allow me to get a great deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1025000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get a great product within my budget and you to still make a good profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $1075000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's a compromise from my previous offers. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
