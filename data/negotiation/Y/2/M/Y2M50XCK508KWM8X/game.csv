"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider this price?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really committed to getting this product, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $115 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal?",115.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $95, so how about $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,8,
