"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $12,000. This is a steal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than her own product valuation. It makes the most sense to go with your backup plan and buy from John for $8,000."
