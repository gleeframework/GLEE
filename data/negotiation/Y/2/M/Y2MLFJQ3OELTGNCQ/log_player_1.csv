{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* By offering a price within Bob's range, I increase the chance of a quick deal. 
* I'm also being positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000** is too low for me. While it's better than selling to John, I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which still gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $11500?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than selling to John, and it shows Bob is willing to negotiate.
* While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob will walk away or I'll get stuck in a lengthy process. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids potential losses."
