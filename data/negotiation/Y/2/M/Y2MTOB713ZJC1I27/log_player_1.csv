Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair and reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for Alice.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's high value (""unique value proposition"") to justify the high price without revealing Alice's true valuation.
* **Open to negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice shows a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chances of a successful sale.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can still negotiate downwards, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
