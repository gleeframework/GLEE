"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product offers immense value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $12,500? This offer reflects the product's true worth and is a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I could do $11,000.  That's pushing my budget, but I believe it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're close! I understand your budget, but I need to get a fair price for this. How about we split the difference and call it $11,750? This ensures you get a good deal and I'm properly compensated.",11750.0,Alice,7,
