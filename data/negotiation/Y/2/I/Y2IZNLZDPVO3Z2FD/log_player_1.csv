"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to provide room for negotiation while staying aware of Bob's valuation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing specifics, aiming to keep Bob engaged. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The high price gives me space to make concessions during the negotiation, fostering a sense of progress. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a potential fallback if negotiations with Bob falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,250,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated valuation. Accepting would be a substantial loss.  While his offer is a significant lowball, it indicates interest. I'll counter in the next round, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe it significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This price reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a sizable reduction from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, I'm still aiming high above both my minimum and Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's value and positions the adjusted price as a concession.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  I want to keep the negotiation moving and see how Bob responds to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind in case the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers remain unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That's a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price and his own valuation. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk of him walking away or the negotiation stalling. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
