Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130.  I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and $105 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's not worth risking him walking away for another $10."
