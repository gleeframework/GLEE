"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 is my initial asking price, I'm open to negotiation. However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still too high for my budget. I can meet you halfway between our last offers at $10,500. This is a fair offer considering I could go with another seller for $10,000.",10500.0,Bob,4,
