Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob up further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to make a significant saving to justify the purchase.

Bob has met John's offer. It's unlikely we can negotiate him up further, and there's no point in risking losing the sale at this point."
