"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for its value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low. My final offer is $125.  This is a very fair price for a product of this quality.",125.0,Alice,5,
