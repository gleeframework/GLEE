# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for its value. What do you think?

You have three options:

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth going to the next round and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is still too high, but she's moving in the right direction.  It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low. My final offer is $125.  This is a very fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $125 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  While I've enjoyed the negotiation, it's time to move on.  John is offering the product for my desired price."
