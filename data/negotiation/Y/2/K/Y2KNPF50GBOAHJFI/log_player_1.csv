{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly lower than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation, but it's still above Bob's estimated value, making it appealing to him.  I'm hopeful he'll accept, but if not, I'll be ready to counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $80. Would you be willing to lower the price to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'm going to try to get closer to that by countering Bob's offer.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal going."", ""product_price"": 85}
