Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While you'd accept $100 from John, getting the highest price from Bob is ideal. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Starting high but below your minimum ($100) allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a price higher than his perceived value while still ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed $100 from John."
