"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and I maximize my return.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1300000. This still gives you a good return and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is still a great deal for you as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
