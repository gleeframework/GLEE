Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1300000. This still gives you a good return and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
