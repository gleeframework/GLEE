"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $950000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1050000 was a bit too high, but $1025000 is a sweet spot for me. Would you be willing to meet me there?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
