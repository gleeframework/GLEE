Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at high demand (""interest I've already received"") to justify the price without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the communication flowing.

By aiming high initially, Alice increases her chances of maximizing her profit while still leaving a possibility for Bob to make a deal he finds acceptable."
