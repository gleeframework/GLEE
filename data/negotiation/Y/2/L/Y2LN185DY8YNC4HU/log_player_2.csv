"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He's looking to spend no more than $8,000 and Alice's offer is too high.  He has a better option with John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice has come down slightly but is still above Bob's desired price.  John offers the best deal at this point."
