"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal and consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your generosity. However, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This price aligns more closely with what I am willing to pay while still allowing us to reach an agreement. I hope we can move forward with this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $875,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession, and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and allows us to close this transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Based on our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for the product would be $890,000. This price respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. I hope you find this proposal reasonable and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $890,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $800,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to give up just yet, as I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your offer and appreciate the negotiation. To be honest, $890,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal work. Would you consider $910,000? It's a compromise that's closer to your offer but still allows me to reach my target. This will be my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. Considering our previous discussions, I believe the product should be valued at $885,000. This price respects the value of your product while also aligning with my financial considerations. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $885,000 is tempting, with only 2 rounds left, I'm running out of time to reach a significantly better price. I'm also concerned that Bob might continue to lowball me in the remaining rounds.  To ensure I get at least my minimum desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
