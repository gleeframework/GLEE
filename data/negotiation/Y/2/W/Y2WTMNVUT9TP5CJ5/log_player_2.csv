# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident this price is fair considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
