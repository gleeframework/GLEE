Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. 

* **Reasoning:**
    * **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $150, so a price of $140 is within his range.
    * **My Value:** $140 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring a good profit.
    * **John's Offer:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $100, so I'm not taking a huge risk. 

This strategy aims to strike a deal with Bob while still leaving room for negotiation."
