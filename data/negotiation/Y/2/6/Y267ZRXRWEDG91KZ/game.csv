"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it will be a valuable asset.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I believe its potential benefit to you warrants a price closer to $1,250,000. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Let's continue to explore options and see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations and willing to work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
