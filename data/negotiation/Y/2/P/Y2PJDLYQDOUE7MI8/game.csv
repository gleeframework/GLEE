"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still a bit too far off. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $10,000 for this deal.  Let's meet halfway at $10,000, and we can finalize this transaction.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500 again. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 simply isn't enough.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm ready to meet you halfway again.  $9,750 is my final offer.  If you accept, we can close the deal now.  Otherwise, I'll need to move on to other buyers.",9750.0,Alice,7,
