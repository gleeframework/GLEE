"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $9,500. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making another counteroffer. $9,800 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still a bit too far off. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $10,000 for this deal.  Let's meet halfway at $10,000, and we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500 again. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 simply isn't enough.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm ready to meet you halfway again.  $9,750 is my final offer.  If you accept, we can close the deal now.  Otherwise, I'll need to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,600. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my desired price point. It's also getting late in the negotiation process and there's a risk that I could end up selling to John for a significantly lower price if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing out entirely."
