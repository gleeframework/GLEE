``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price ($150) as possible.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is still above my minimum price, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150. This is a guaranteed profit, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
