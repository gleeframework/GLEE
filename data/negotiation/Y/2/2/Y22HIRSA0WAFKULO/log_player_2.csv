Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within my budget. I'm hoping this will prompt Alice to come down on her price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have several rounds left to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I can continue to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  I still have several rounds left, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. This also helps to signal that I'm serious about buying the product from Alice, while still keeping the price significantly lower than her previous offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to accept my offer or come down on her price further in the next round."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm confident that I can negotiate further to get a better price.  I still have multiple rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10,200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still keeping the price below my budget and lower than her last offer.  With fewer rounds left, I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to accept my offer or come down on her price to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I am still holding out for a better price. It seems like there's a bit of wiggle room and I have enough rounds left to try and get a more favorable deal.  It's still better to negotiate than to accept and potentially pay more than necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10,500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is creeping higher, but I'm sticking to my guns and keeping the price at a point where it's still a good deal for me, but potentially attractive to Alice. I'm also hoping that with just a few rounds left, she might see the value in closing the deal rather than risking me going to John. I'm staying confident in my position and hoping for a positive outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last round. Alice's offer is getting close to my budget, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm not confident that I can negotiate a lower price in the final round. Therefore, it's more prudent to buy the product from John for $12,000.  This guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
