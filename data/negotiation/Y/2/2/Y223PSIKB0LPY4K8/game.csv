"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me though. I'm interested, but could you do it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and do $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,250. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $12,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
