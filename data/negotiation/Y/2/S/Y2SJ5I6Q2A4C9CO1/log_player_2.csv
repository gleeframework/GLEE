"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can save $100,000 compared to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still represents a great deal for you, as it's below your perceived value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price at this level. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer matches the price John is offering. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as you can't get a lower price."
