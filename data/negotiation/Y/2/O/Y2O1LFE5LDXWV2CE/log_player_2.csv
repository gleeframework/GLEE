Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget of $12,000. He should counteroffer and see if he can negotiate a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

I'll sell the product to you for $16,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is now offering $16,500, which is still over his budget of $12,000.  While there's a chance he could negotiate her down further, John is offering the product at a price he's comfortable with.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation to save a few hundred dollars."
