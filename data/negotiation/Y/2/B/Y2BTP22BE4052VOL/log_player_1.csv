{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's in great condition and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer aims for a middle ground between my minimum price of $10,000 and Bob's estimated value of $8,000.  It gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me a decent profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a little more than his estimated value, especially if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept an offer that is so far below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you consider $8,800? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

While $8,800 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm not willing to drop my price further at this point.  I'm hoping I can get a bit closer to my target with another counteroffer."
