"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living, you know. I can do $8,200, and that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd consider?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,200 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,100?",7100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can do $7,800, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,450. I can do $7,600, but I'm starting to get a little worried that we'll go over the 10 rounds and I'll have to sell it to someone else. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7600.0,Alice,9,
