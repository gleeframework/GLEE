Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a price closer to $800,000, Alice's offer of $815,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's still below my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and a better deal than buying from John.  It's worth accepting the offer and finalizing the deal."
