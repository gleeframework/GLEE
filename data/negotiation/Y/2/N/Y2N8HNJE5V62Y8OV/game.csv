"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a special offer, I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",815000.0,Alice,5,
