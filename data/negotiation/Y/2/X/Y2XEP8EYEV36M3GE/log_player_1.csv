"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $100 to Bob, and I want to maximize my profit.  I'll see if he's willing to pay this price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum price of $100. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $110. This is a compromise between my initial price of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. I believe this is a fair price, as it's still above my minimum price of $100 and may be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $100.  I believe I can still get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $105. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to a deal and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm concerned that we're running out of time to reach a deal.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, which is the best option available to me at this point."
