Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($15,000), so you don't need to accept anything less.
* **Aiming high:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but potentially within reach if he finds the product very desirable.
* **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers adds a time pressure that might make Bob more amenable to paying a premium. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. There's no guarantee Bob will accept $20,000. However, it maximizes the potential profit while still giving you the security of John's offer."
