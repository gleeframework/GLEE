Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still keeping you well above your minimum. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
