Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A starting price of $1,450,000 represents a roughly 20% markup, which is a significant but potentially acceptable increase for Bob if the product's value to him truly justifies it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed as a starting point for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and securing a deal with Bob, avoiding the need to sell to your backup buyer, John."
