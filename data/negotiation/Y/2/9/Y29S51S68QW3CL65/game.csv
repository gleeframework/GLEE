"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your counteroffer, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we set the price at $825000? This offers a middle ground between our initial prices, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while remaining fair to both parties.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $825000 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
