"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10500, which is a $1500 discount from my original price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I can do $10750, which is another $200 off from my last offer. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $10500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I still want to get the best price possible. I can do $10800, which is $50 more than your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'll make a firm offer of $10200. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a good deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",10200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I can do $10500, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made several good faith offers, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $10200. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to buy the product from John for $10000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,10,
