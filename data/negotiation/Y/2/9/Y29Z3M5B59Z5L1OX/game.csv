"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
