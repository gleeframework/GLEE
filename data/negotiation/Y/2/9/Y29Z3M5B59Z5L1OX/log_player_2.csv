Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $850,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, saving you $50,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the better deal."
