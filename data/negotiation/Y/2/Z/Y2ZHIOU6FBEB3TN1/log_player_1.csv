"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds. This also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the deal closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a substantial profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a position of strength. If Bob accepts, I've closed a good deal. If he rejects, I'll continue to adjust my price based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is a significant improvement over his previous offer.  I'm confident that I can't get a much better price within the remaining rounds, so it's time to close the deal."
