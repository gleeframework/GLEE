"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you'd find beneficial.  While I'm confident in its worth to you, I understand it may not be the perfect fit. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her valuation:** Alice is willing to sell for $1,400,000, but the product is worth $1,200,000 to her. This suggests she may be willing to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is your upper limit:**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price. 

**Strategy:**  It's better to try to negotiate a better deal with Alice. Rejecting her offer creates leverage for you, and you might be able to secure a price closer to her valuation."
