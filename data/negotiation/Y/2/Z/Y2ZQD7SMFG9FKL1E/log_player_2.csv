Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to try and negotiate with her before resorting to John's offer."

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still within the realm of possibility for me, but it gives Alice some room to counter without feeling pressured."

I'm offering John's price, as I'm comfortable with that amount and it's a fair price for both of us. If Alice accepts, great. If not, I can confidently buy from John."

I'm offering a price closer to my maximum limit, but still lower than Alice's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer is enticing enough for Alice to accept and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation before I accept. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to close the deal closer to my maximum limit."

I'm offering a price that is a bit higher than my previous counteroffer, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. I hope this shows I'm willing to meet her halfway and incentivizes her to accept, as it's getting closer to her desired price."
