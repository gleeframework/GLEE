"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable and worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the initial offer I made.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
