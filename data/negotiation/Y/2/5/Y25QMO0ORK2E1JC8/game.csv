"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a compromise closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $112.50. This seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",112.5,Bob,4,
