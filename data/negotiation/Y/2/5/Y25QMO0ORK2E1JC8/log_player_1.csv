"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a compromise closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $112.50. This seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating, $112.50 is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
