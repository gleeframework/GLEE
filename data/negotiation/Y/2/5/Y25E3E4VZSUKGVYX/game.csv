"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm looking for at least $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $1,212,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
