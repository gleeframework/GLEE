"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $8,750? It's the best I can do, but I really like the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  How about $8,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
