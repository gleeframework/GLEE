Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we are getting closer. To be honest, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us very close to the middle."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $100, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's still quite a way from my target price.  I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will eat up the remaining rounds and I'll end up having to take a price higher than I want or settle for John's offer anyway. Buying from John now guarantees I get the best price available to me."
