"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $80? I think that's a fair price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $80 is still a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to make another move. How about we settle on $110? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal with you.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we are getting closer. To be honest, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us very close to the middle.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $100, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,7,
