"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help gauge how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup who is willing to pay $120. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. You know the product is worth at least $120 to you. It's clear there's a wide gap to bridge, but you can try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by dropping $30 from the initial price. This is a significant concession, but it avoids plummeting directly towards Bob's low offer.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't require an explicit reason for the high price, maintaining the product's potential value in Bob's eyes.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, encouraging Bob to counter and hopefully move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $80? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** Bob's offer of $80 is his estimated value of the product, but it remains below your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob hasn't significantly increased his offer, he is showing a willingness to negotiate. There's still room to try and reach a price closer to your target.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John for $120. This knowledge gives you the power to walk away from a deal with Bob if it doesn't meet your needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $80 is still a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to make another move. How about we settle on $110? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal with you."", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making another concession, but this time a smaller one of $20. This demonstrates flexibility while still moving towards your target price. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  With each round, you're getting closer to the 10-round limit.  This counteroffer creates some time pressure, potentially encouraging Bob to make a more significant move if he really wants the product.
* **Final Offer (for now):** This could be framed as your final offer to signal seriousness.  However, you still retain the option to negotiate further or accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we are getting closer. To be honest, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us very close to the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to your minimum, but still not acceptable. You're only $30 away from your guaranteed sale price with John, and with 4 rounds left, you have room to push for more. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's increments are getting smaller ($10 this round). This suggests he might be nearing his maximum price, and large jumps from him are less likely. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** Accepting $90 at this stage would be giving up leverage too early.  You can use the remaining rounds and the John offer to try to nudge Bob closer to $100 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $100, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer shows you are meeting Bob halfway from your previous offer while establishing a firm limit. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $100 is a strong psychological price point. It feels like a round number and might be more appealing to Bob than, say, $95. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only three rounds remaining, you are subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision.  This might encourage him to accept this offer or make a more substantial counteroffer."
