"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also open to lowering the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm hoping to get closer to $110, and I'm confident I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful to get a better price. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering $98.  This is a small reduction from my previous offer, showing my continued willingness to compromise. I believe this is a fair price that's close to Bob's perceived value, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and I'm running out of time. I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob with only 4 rounds left, and selling to John would be a loss compared to this offer."
