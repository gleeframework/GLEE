"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you at $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $9,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  Considering the value of the product and its potential benefit to you, I believe a price of $11,000 would be a fair compromise.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $11,400. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.  Let's close this deal, I know we can find common ground.",11400.0,Alice,7,
