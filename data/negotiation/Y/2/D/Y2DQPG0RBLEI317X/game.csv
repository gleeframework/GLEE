,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to get a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
