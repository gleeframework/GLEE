"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $9000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price.  However, $7500 is just a bit too low for me to consider right now. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $8250 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",8250.0,Bob,4,
