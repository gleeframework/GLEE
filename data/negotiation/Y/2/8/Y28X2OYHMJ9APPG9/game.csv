"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $1100000. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1050000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your valuation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your financial situation, I must respectfully decline your offer of $1050000. Our product is valued significantly higher than that, especially considering its unique features and benefits. I am proposing a counteroffer of $1150000 for the product. This still allows for a substantial profit margin while keeping the deal competitive. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to meet your price of $1150000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1100000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
