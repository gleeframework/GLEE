"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than what I had in mind. This product holds a certain value for me, and I'm prepared to offer $600,000. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering it's significantly more than half your initial asking price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",950000.0,Alice,5,
