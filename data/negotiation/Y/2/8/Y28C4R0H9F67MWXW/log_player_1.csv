"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a reasonable starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price of $110, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also stating that it's my final offer to put some pressure on Bob and encourage him to accept."
