Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a good starting point. It's a price that's slightly below my guaranteed sale price but significantly higher than what Bob values the product at. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate downwards slightly if I want to avoid going to John.  

This strategy aims to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while ensuring I don't miss out on a sale entirely."
