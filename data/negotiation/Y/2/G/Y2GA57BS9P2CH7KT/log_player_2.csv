"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. I believe this is a fair price and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'll counter with $1,250,000. This price still allows for a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired range. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  Bob has 7 rounds left and can continue to negotiate. It's still worth trying to get a lower price, especially as he has the option of buying from John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows for a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. It's important for me to get close to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can finally agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly what Bob could get from John.  There's no benefit to continuing negotiation as any further counteroffers from Bob could be rejected, and he'd be left with the option to buy from John anyway.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob time and potential frustration."
