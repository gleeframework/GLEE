"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. I believe this is a fair price and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'll counter with $1,250,000. This price still allows for a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired range. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows for a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. It's important for me to get close to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can finally agree on this.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
