{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  $12,000 is likely to trigger a counteroffer from Bob, allowing for further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting this would be a huge loss. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to pay something.  There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's proposal.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $9,000 is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $5,000, suggesting a potential meeting point.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $9,000 is well above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I still receive a worthwhile price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That's a fair offer considering the value and it works for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to compromise. A counteroffer could potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is Always an Option:** If further negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I don't lose out on a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $8,500. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to reach a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a middle ground.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** $8,500 is still well above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring that I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Last Chance for Negotiation:** This offer represents a significant compromise, and I'm hoping that Bob will find it acceptable. If he rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John to avoid further negotiation."
