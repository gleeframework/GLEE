"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900,000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant investment on my part, and demonstrates my strong interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you're serious about purchasing the product. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. Let's try $850,000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $800,000, which is $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This shows I'm committed to getting this deal done.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,7,
