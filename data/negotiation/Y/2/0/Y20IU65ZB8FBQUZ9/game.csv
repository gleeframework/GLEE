"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
