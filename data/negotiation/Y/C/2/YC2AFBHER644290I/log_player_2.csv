# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Considering its value and your interest, I'm extending this opportunity to secure it for $140. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you receive the best value. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer ($140) is slightly above her own valuation ($120), it's still less than your maximum budget ($150) and significantly cheaper than buying from John ($150). Accepting this offer represents the best value for you."
