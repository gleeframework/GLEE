"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $115. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that level.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, Bob. However, I've invested time and resources into this product, and I'm not comfortable selling it for that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110.  It's getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement there.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, Bob. I think $105 is a bit too low considering the value the product brings. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $105, which would be $107.50. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",107.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $106.25?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement there.",106.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $107.50, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $106.25, which would be $106.875. I think this is a fair compromise, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'd like to make one final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",106.875,Alice,9,
