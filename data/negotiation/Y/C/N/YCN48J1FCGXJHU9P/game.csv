"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This offer allows us both to make a good deal without compromising too much.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a mutually agreeable price. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000. This offer takes into account the value this product brings while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I understand the value of the product, $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
