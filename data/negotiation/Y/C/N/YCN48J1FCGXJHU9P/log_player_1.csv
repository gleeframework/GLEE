"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This offer allows us both to make a good deal without compromising too much. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly below John's standing offer.  I will counter in hopes of getting closer to at least $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a mutually agreeable price. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000. This offer takes into account the value this product brings while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I understand the value of the product, $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has finally crossed the $1,200,000 threshold, offering $1,250,000.  This is now a profit over what John is offering and continuing to negotiate has a higher risk than reward at this point."
