"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to the product's value for her ($80)."
