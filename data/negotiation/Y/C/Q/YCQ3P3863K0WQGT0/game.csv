"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's worth to you is $10000, I think we can find a middle ground.  How about $11000? ",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not ready to let it go for $11000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $12500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  But $12500 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11750?  This way, we both get a good deal, and I can get the product without having to go elsewhere.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $11750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $13000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
