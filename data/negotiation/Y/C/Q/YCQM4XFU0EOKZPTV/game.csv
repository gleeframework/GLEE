"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. I think this is the lowest price I can offer and still make a reasonable profit.",10250.0,Alice,5,
