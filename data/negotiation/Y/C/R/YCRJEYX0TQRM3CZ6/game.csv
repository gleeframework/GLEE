"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1500000.  It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident you'll see the potential in it. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $1200000 is a significant offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1350000?  This allows for some wiggle room for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this revised price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $1250000 is a fair offer, and I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this happen.  Let's settle on $1300000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'd be willing to go up to $1200000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
