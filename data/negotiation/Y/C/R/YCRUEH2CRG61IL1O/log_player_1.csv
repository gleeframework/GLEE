"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to maximize potential profit.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so this is a reasonable starting point. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Test the Waters:**  This opening offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me an idea of his perceived value of the product.
* **Option to Walk Away:**  I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount of money, it's below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I'm not comfortable selling below my minimum value, as it wouldn't be a worthwhile deal for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's offer shows he's interested in the product. This gives me room to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 8 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above my minimum value and represents a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Lowering the price demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Value:** $1,200,000 is still well above my minimum price, ensuring I'm getting a good return on the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer gives me the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest further and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $1,000,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Threshold:**  I'm only $100,000 away from my minimum value.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to pay a good price.  I want to see if I can squeeze out another $100,000 or more.
* **Time is on my side:** I have six rounds left, which gives me enough time to continue negotiating.
* **Option to Sell to John:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $900,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate but am not willing to go below my minimum value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Minimum Value:**  $1,050,000 is above my minimum price, ensuring I get a good return.
* **Increase Pressure:**  This offer puts the pressure on Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum.
* **Time is Running Out:** With five rounds remaining, it's crucial to start narrowing the gap."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more.  I have four rounds left and believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Threshold:** I'm only $50,000 away from my minimum, and I believe there's a good chance I can get that extra $50,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to go higher than $900,000. I want to see if I can push him to $1,000,000.
* **Time to Close:**  With four rounds left, it's important to start narrowing the gap quickly. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I can still choose to sell to John if this negotiation fails."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Bob's last offer was only $50,000 below this, and with only three rounds left, I need to make a stand.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** $1,000,000 is my bottom line. I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Close to Agreement:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, making an agreement likely.
* **Limited Time:**  With only three rounds left, it's important to show firmness and attempt to secure a deal.
* **Option to Sell to John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time, and I'm not confident that I can push him to my desired price within the remaining two rounds.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** With only two rounds left, there's a significant risk that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer in the next round, and the risk of rejecting his offer and then being forced to sell to John at a lower price is too high. 

I'm choosing to secure a guaranteed profit rather than risk a potential loss."
