"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's not the best deal you can potentially get. You're aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still within your budget and you're still aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you another opportunity to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $135 is still a little more than I'd like to pay. How about $132?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 132}
