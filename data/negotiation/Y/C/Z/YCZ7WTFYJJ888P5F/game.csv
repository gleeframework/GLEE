"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to save as much money as I can. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $8,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground, but $8,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,750, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product to you. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
