"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs perfectly and offers exceptional value. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than its actual cost. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring both of us benefit? Would you be interested in exploring this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $75 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in discussion. Based on our conversation, I would like to propose a price of $72 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers, aiming to ensure you receive a reasonable value for your purchase while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. Please let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $72, which is within my budget and a good compromise. It's not a huge savings, but it's better than the $80 I'd pay from John. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without risking further negotiation."
