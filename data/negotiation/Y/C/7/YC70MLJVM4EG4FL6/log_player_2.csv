Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've reviewed our costs and market positioning, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. My proposal is to set the product price at $740,000. This offers a fair compromise between our previous offers and ensures a reasonable profit margin for my business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $740,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $725,000.  While I'd love to get it even lower,  I'm concerned about running out of rounds and having to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting this offer saves me $260,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving. I'm going to accept and close this deal."
