"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 Accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** While it's less than my ideal price, it's still a significant profit above my minimum ($14,000 vs. $15,000).
* **Avoids Risk:** Continuing negotiations could lead to Bob lowering his offer further, or I might miss out on both offers. John's offer is a safety net, not an ideal outcome. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and ensures I get paid sooner."
