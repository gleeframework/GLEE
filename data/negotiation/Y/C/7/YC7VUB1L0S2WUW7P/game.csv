"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,600,000 for the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  I think this is a fair price considering your value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
