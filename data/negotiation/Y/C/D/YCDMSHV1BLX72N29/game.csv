"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more than that, but I'd like to see some wiggle room.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the value I see in it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still at a loss with that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's make it happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of that number. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the value I see in it.",975000.0,Bob,6,
