Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand the value he places on the product. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I can analyze his counteroffer to understand his perceived value and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This tells me that Bob is likely price-sensitive and may be willing to pay more. 

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential final price that's closer to my ideal. 

This counteroffer allows me to:

*  Test if Bob is truly willing to pay more than his initial offer.
*  Keep the negotiation moving forward without risking a sale to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer of $1,400,000 is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can push him higher. 

Since John is willing to buy the product for $1,500,000, it's a safer and more profitable choice to sell to him. This guarantees me a better return than accepting Bob's offer and prevents further rounds of negotiation that might ultimately result in a lower price."
