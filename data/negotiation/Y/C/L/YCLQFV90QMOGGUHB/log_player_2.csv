Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and is unwilling to budge. While getting to $750,000 would be ideal, we're close enough to justify accepting.  Waiting might lead to impasse and force us to buy from John at the higher price."
