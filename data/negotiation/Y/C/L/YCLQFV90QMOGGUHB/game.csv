"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to give up on the premium value of this product just yet.

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.
