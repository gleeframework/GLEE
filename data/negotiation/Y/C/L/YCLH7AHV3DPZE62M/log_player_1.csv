Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away. Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're starting with a strong but justifiable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Emphasize the ""unique value and potential"" to remind Bob of the product's benefits.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you've set a strong initial price, there's some flexibility for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Time Constraints:** If you're under time pressure, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob.

**Remember:** This is just the first step in the negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your position based on Bob's response."
