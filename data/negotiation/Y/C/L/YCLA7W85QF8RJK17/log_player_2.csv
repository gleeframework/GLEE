"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  There's no harm in rejecting the initial offer and seeing what counteroffer Alice makes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give Alice a clear idea that I'm serious about negotiating and might be willing to walk away if she doesn't come down in price.  We'll see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $70, which is within my budget and a good compromise. It's better than buying from John, so I'll accept the offer and move on."
