"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,150,000 is still a little too steep for my budget.  How about $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations. I'm willing to move a bit to $1,112,500, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1112500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,093,750.  I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings to my business.",1093750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me.  This is my final offer, and I believe it is a very fair price. ",1100000.0,Alice,7,
