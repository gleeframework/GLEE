{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price of $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a good starting point, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the amount I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target, I still believe the product's worth justifies a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  How about we compromise one last time and meet at $1,090,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product while also offering you a good deal. I'm hoping we can finalize this transaction today."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum threshold and I want to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to sell to John for a lower price. It's better to secure a deal now than to keep negotiating and potentially lose out altogether."
