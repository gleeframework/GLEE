"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can you consider this price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
