"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $175?  Let me know if that works for you.",175.0,Alice,3,
