Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed fallback option with John for $1,200,000. 
* **Potential upside:** By offering $1,500,000, I'm aiming for a higher profit. This price is ambitious but might be attractive to Bob if the product is valuable to him.
* **Risk/Reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, I still get my minimum value from John. However, there's a chance I could get a significantly higher price from Bob. 

This offer balances the need to maximize my earnings with the need to secure a sale."
