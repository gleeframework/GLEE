Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I am willing to consider your latest offer of $1,600,000. However, I would like to reiterate that my budget is tight, so I would need to negotiate the price further. My counteroffer is $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly below John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk that we might not reach an agreement above $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now with John provides immediate capital. Prolonging the negotiation with Bob delays receiving payment and potentially misses other opportunities.

Therefore, it makes more financial sense to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
