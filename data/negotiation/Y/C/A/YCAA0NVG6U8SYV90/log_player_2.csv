"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Please let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's a chance she might be willing to sell it for less than $1,200,000.  Rejecting her initial offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice. Consider what price you'd be willing to pay and make your counteroffer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your interest in the product but also your desire to negotiate. 
* **Room for negotiation:** It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the counteroffer. You can adjust this price in subsequent rounds based on her responses.
* **Alternative option:** Keep in mind that you have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000. This gives you leverage during negotiations with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to result in a lower price.
* **Value proposition:** $1,100,000 is still within your budget of $1,200,000, and represents a significant saving compared to Alice's initial price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice, as it allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking a higher cost by continuing to negotiate."
