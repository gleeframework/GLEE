Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term value it represents."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product. While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's still less than what John is offering. It's worth continuing the negotiation a bit longer to see if we can get Bob closer to at least $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm confident this product can generate significantly more value for you in the long run.  Let's settle at $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true potential of this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant. To make this work, I can go up to $900,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is inching up, but very slowly. We're still significantly below John's offer.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, so it's worth one more counter-offer. If he doesn't budge significantly in the next round, we'll take John's deal."

However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I hope we can close the deal at this price."",
