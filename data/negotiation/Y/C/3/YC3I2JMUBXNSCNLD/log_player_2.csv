# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product could be of great value to you and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start things off, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I think this reflects the true worth of what this product offers.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term value it represents. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm confident this product can generate significantly more value for you in the long run.  Let's settle at $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true potential of this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. It seems we both recognize the value here. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not coming down to a reasonable price point. Her latest offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It seems unlikely she'll drastically reduce the price in the remaining rounds.  Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best price for you."
