"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's value of $15,000. 

This initial offer also signals my confidence in the product's value and sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering Bob's willingness to go up to $9,500. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to close the deal."
