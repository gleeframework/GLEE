Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's why this is a good starting strategy:

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $120, even if Bob counteroffers lower, there's a good chance you can still settle on a price that earns you more than John's $100 offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about how much he values the product and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $65 is far too low. It's important not to get anchored to this low number. We know John will pay $100, making Bob's current offer unacceptable.  We'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground closer to our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While I understand your initial offer, $65 is significantly below what I had in mind.  Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Firmness (but Willingness):** By countering with $110, we are signaling that we are firm on a price above $100 but are open to negotiation within a reasonable range.
* **Anchoring to a Higher Price:** This counteroffer tries to move the negotiation away from Bob's low anchor of $65 and towards a price closer to our desired range.
* **Maintaining the Option of John:** We haven't committed to Bob's offer and can still sell to John for $100 if needed. This gives us leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob stating ""$80 is my final offer"" indicates he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees us a $100 sale, which is better than Bob's $80.
* **Avoiding Further Haggling:**  Continuing negotiation with Bob might be fruitless and could cost us time and energy.

It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed profit with John rather than risking a lower outcome with Bob."
