# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for... $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.

Alice's offer:

Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but she's also holding firm to a price floor. At $630,000, we're getting a significant discount from her initial offer and it's unlikely further haggling will yield much more. Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
