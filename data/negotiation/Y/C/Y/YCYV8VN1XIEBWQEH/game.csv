"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price is reflective of the value it holds.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 remains beyond my limit. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,550,000, which I believe is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. This offer demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this valuable product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
