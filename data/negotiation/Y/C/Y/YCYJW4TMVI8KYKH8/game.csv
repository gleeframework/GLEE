"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and I believe we can make this deal work.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $11,500? That's the highest I can go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $11,500 is a good offer, but it's still a little below what I need to get.  I'm going to counter with $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's really my bottom line.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
