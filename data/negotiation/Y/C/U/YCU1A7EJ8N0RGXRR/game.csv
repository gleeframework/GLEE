"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is lower than my initial offer, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $10,700.  This is a fair price that recognizes your need for a good deal while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to close this deal - I'm ready to move forward.
