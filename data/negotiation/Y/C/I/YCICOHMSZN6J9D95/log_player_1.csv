Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially saving you considerable costs in the long run.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, Alice starts the negotiation close to that figure.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The price offers Bob a potential discount while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Urgency and scarcity:** Highlighting other interested parties (even if John is the only one) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making the offer more enticing.

This approach aims to secure a deal close to John's offer while leaving some room for potential negotiation with Bob."
