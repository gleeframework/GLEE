"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $9000 for it, given my price limit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000. However, I'm still sticking to my budget of $10000.  I'm happy to pay that amount for the product, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
