"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really aiming to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10,000 yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more of what I need."", ""product_price"": 11000}
