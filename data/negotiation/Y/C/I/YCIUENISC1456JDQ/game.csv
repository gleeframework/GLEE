"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
