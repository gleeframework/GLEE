Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him an incentive to buy. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation and helps you get the best price possible while still ensuring a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, you can still do better. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and you have room to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that is still attractive to Bob while getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a good offer, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $105, which is only $5 away from your previous counteroffer of $110. This is a good compromise, and it's much better than selling to John for $80. 

It's important to note that while you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away completely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum."
