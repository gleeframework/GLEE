"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any wiggle room on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is significantly below what I need to sell for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm looking for a more significant discount. How about we meet at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10000? That way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid selling to John for less than I'd prefer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet at $9500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,6,
