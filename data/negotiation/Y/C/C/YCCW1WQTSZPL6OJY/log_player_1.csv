"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, slightly higher than my minimum value, to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he's not, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value of $120. I'll try to get closer to that by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum value and might be appealing enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more. I still have several rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept my minimum value of $120. If Bob doesn't take it, I'll sell to John."
