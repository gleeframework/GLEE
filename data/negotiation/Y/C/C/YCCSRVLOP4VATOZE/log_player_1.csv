Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still giving me a profit above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $70 is below my minimum price of $80.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is still above my minimum price of $80, but it's closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, we can reach a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob seems unwilling to budge much. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potential stalemate.  Selling to John for $80 guarantees my minimum profit, and it's a good deal considering the circumstances."
