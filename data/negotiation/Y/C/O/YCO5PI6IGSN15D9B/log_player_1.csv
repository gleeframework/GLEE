Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's start with a price of $900,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm excited about the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe the value it offers you justifies this price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's a slight improvement, it's still not close enough to what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try one more time to negotiate a better price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $812,500? This price reflects the value of the product and also allows you to stay within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $795,000, which is a compromise between our last offers. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to reaching a deal with Bob, the price is still below my minimum. I don't want to risk wasting more time on negotiations and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale to John. I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
