{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in my counteroffers. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than $8,000, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Can you meet me at $9,800? That would be a great compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,800 is a good price. It's closer to my desired price of $12,000, and it's a good compromise considering Bob's budget constraints. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
