"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Could you do $13,000? That would make it worth it for me to let it go.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $13,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $11,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
