"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500?  It's still a great deal, and I think it's fair to both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
