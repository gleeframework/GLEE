"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $600,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price that balances our needs and allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $750,000, Bob, but I'm still not sure if that's enough for me to let the product go. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a very good price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
