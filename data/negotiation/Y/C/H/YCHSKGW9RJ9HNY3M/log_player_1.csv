Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit. Bob gets a $2,000 discount from his perceived value, making it a good deal for him and motivating him to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where both you and Bob benefit."
