"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're the only ones with access to this product, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential, but $600,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $450,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $550,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $500,000. Would you be willing to settle at $510,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the potential of the product and the current market conditions.",510000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $510,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $525,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",525000.0,Alice,5,
