"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're the only ones with access to this product, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $510,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $525,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?

Alice is very slowly coming down on price, and we're getting close to a point where she may not budge much further.  It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing her away.  $525,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
