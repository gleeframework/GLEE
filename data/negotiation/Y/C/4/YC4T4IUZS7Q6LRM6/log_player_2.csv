"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. Given its value to you, we suggest starting at $90. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still more than Bob's maximum price point of $80. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $80?  That's my absolute top price, but it would allow us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
