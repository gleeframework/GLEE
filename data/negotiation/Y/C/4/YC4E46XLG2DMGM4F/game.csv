"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $1,100,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your approach. How about we try this: $1,600,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and shows my commitment to getting this deal done.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,150,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
