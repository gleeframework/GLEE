"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  A high initial offer sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. Even though it's significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, it gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" you frame the product's value subjectively, potentially persuading Bob to see it as worth more than his initial assessment.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his perspective, initiating a dialogue rather than an ultimatum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. While his message is polite, accepting $1,000,000 would be a substantial loss.  It's important to demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. Proceeding to the next round allows you to counter and work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  Moving down to $1,750,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Framing:** By stating it's ""significantly below its true worth,"" you reiterate the product's value and subtly push back against Bob's lower offer.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired range. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** You're still significantly above Bob's valuation but have created space for further negotiation while staying well above your $1,500,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $1,100,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below your $1,500,000 safety net with John. While he's trying to find middle ground, accepting now would mean a considerable loss.  You have room to negotiate further, and it's worth seeing if you can bring him closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your approach. How about we try this: $1,600,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and shows my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  Moving down to $1,600,000 is a substantial concession, signaling to Bob that you're serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting Commitment:** By emphasizing your commitment to the deal, you create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** You're still above your minimum but have created a tighter negotiating range, making it more difficult for Bob to justify a low counteroffer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With fewer rounds remaining, putting a stronger offer on the table increases the pressure for Bob to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,150,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is barely budging, and he's still significantly below your $1,500,000 safety net. This suggests he's unlikely to meet your desired price range within the remaining rounds.  

* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost.  John offers a guaranteed sale at your desired minimum.
* **Limited Progress:** Bob's incremental increases indicate he might be trying to wear you down rather than make a serious offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price or a failed negotiation, whereas selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable outcome. 

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
