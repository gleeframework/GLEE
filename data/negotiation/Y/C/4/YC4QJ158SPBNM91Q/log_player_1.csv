"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The goal is to maximize profit.  While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great price for a product that's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $800,000. $775,000 is better than $750,000, but I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
