Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm ready to counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell at that price. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and I'm confident I can't get much more from Bob."
