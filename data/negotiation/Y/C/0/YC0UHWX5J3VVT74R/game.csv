"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $12,000 is a tempting price, I'm still aiming a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This reflects the product's true value and is a fair offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $13,500 is the highest I can go. This price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. What if we settled on $14,250?  That's me coming down significantly, and I believe it represents a very fair deal for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,750. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,6,
