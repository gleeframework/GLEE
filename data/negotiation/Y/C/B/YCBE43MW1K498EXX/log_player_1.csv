Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise and is within my acceptable range. There's a risk of going further and potentially losing the deal, and it's better to secure a good price now than risk getting less later or having to sell to John."
