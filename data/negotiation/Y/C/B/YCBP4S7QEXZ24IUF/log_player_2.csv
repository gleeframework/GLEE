"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $9,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to purchase from John for $12,000."
