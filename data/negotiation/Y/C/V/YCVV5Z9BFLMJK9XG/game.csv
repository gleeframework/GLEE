"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. How about $6,500? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,500 is a bit of a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slightly better deal than my previous offer. How about $6,800? It's still a good price for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",6800.0,Alice,5,
