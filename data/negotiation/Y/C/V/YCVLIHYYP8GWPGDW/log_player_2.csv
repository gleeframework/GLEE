# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me, and still provides you with a considerable profit potential. Let me know your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price still allows you to make a good profit and is closer to the value I'm hoping to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.
