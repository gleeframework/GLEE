"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible price while staying within his budget. Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable first step. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better than her initial offer, but Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's only got 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's still room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $9,000 to $9,500, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate. This keeps him within his budget and leaves room for potential compromise with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has 5 rounds left and can always go to John, so there's no need to accept a price that's not within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to pay his maximum budget of $10,000. This is a firm offer, as it represents his limit. If Alice rejects this, Bob will have no choice but to go to John.  This is Bob's last chance to get the product from Alice at a price he's comfortable with."
