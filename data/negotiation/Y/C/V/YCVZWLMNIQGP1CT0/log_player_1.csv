{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  This also sets the initial bar for the negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is interested in the product at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it for $110 right now. I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $112 is still slightly below my minimum, it's getting closer to my target price.  I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale. It's a good price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
