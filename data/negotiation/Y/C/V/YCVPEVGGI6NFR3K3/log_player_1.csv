Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below what you value the product at. You have room to negotiate and are better off seeing if you can get closer to your desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, $1,050,000 is considerably below its true value and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to your price, you still have room to negotiate. You're aiming for at least $1,100,000 and accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table."

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000.  I believe this reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns."",

Bob has not budged from his previous offer, indicating this may be his ceiling. Accepting the $1,075,000 offer is a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely by pushing further."
