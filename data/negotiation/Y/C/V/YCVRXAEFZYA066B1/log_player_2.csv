"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I'm asking for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is for $140. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $135 is closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us and I can make the purchase today."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $130 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $132.  Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has come down to $132, which is still above my target of $120. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and it's likely we'll just go back and forth.  It's more efficient for me to buy from John at my desired price."
