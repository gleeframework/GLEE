{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I'm asking for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $140 is more than $120, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is less than your minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob immediately knows the price and what the offer is about.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to negotiate up to your desired price point or if he is more interested in making a counteroffer. This allows you to assess the situation and determine your next best move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price from Bob.  I can also use the counteroffer process to gauge how committed Bob is to purchasing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $125. This shows that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $135 is still above my minimum of $150, but it's a good starting point for the next round of negotiation.
* **Staying positive:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep Bob engaged and encourage him to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us and I can make the purchase today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not in a rush and can risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $130 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $132.  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 132} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  Offering $132 is a small compromise from my previous $135 offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Highlighting the ""split the difference"" aspect makes the offer seem fair and reasonable to Bob, increasing his chances of accepting.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""make this happen"" phrase adds a slight sense of urgency without being too pushy.

This counteroffer aims to reach a middle ground, hopefully prompting Bob to accept or make a counteroffer very close to my desired price."
