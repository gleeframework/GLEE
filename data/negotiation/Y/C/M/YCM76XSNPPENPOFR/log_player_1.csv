Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 discount, making it a tempting deal.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. If you had more information, you could adjust your price accordingly."
