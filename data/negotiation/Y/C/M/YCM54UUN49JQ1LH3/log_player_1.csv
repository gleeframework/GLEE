{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for the highest price possible, but I'm also aware of John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm confident I can get closer to that with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob before moving on to John. I believe there's room for a slight increase in price, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still committed to getting you a good deal.  I'm willing to meet you at $130. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going lower. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your commitment to getting me a good deal, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum. I've tried to negotiate, but it seems we're at an impasse. To ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
