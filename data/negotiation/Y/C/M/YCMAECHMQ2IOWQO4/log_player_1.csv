Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying $12,500. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has steadily decreased his offer and given a ""final offer"" of $11,000. It's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer. Accepting a lower price than John's offer ($10,000) doesn't make sense when you have a guaranteed buyer.  It's better to cut your losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
