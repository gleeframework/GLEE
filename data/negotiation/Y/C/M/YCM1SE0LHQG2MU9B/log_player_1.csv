"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's well above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're serious:** It's not a lowball offer, so Bob knows you're not just playing games.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob counters, it gives you room to bargain without feeling pressured to go too low. 

Remember, you have 10 rounds, but you can always walk away and sell to John."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is only $500 less than your initial offer. You have room to bargain. There are still 9 rounds left, so it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,250 is my final offer. I believe this is still a great deal for you considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,250.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that the offer is still a great deal.
* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer allows me to potentially close the deal at a price that is closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $9100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,100 is only $150 less than my last offer, and is only $100 less than my desired price. This is a good outcome considering we are already in round 4. It's not worth risking losing the deal for a small amount of money, especially considering the possibility of John buying the product for $8,000."
