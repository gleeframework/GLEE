"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $14,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $14,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value and the fact I'm very interested in the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $15,500, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
