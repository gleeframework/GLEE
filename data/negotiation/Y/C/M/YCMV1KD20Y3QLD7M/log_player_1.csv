Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob at $14,000 is still a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is slightly below our minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but well above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This creates a win-win scenario where Bob gets a perceived ""deal,"" and we still make a substantial profit.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
