"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $11,000 is lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is still a great price for the value you'll receive, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
