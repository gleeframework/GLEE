Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm looking to spend around $750,000. Would you be open to considering that?  Let's see if we can find common ground.
