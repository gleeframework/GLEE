Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $950,000 is less than Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000, making the offer potentially appealing.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** The message establishes your initial position and encourages Bob to respond. 

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and be prepared to counteroffer or walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is still above your minimum of $800,000, it's a significant drop from your initial offer of $950,000.  You're aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is too low at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll want to counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to your initial offer. This will show Bob that you're serious about getting a good price for your product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer, how about $900,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, but not at a price significantly below your original offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message reiterates the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Open to Agreement:**  The message ends with a positive tone, suggesting a willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By offering $900,000, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $875,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is still below your initial target, it's a good deal for a few reasons:

* **Close to Your Minimum:** It's only $75,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even if you accept this offer, you might be able to develop a good relationship with Bob for future potential deals.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If you reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with only John's offer of $800,000.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale that's close to your minimum, and you open the possibility of future collaborations."
