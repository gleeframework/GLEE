"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) but still within a reasonable range for Bob, who values it at $8,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than my minimum but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $8100. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's close to my minimum. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I still have several rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $8,150. This is a very fair price, and it's just a small difference from your offer. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8150}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous one, showing continued compromise. This should encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to save a bit of money. I'm willing to meet you at $8100, just like my previous offer. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's a good deal considering I'm running out of negotiation rounds.  There's a chance Bob might reject further counteroffers, and I risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure the sale now."
