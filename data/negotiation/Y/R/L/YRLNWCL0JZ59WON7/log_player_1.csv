Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  That's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to get a little anxious about losing the deal, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm firm on $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
