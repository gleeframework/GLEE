"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that! Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  That's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do it for $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm firm on $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
