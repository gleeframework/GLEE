"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product seems valuable,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
