"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, which still represents a substantial profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
