"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12500? That would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit above my budget at $12500. Would you be willing to consider $11000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,11000.0,Bob,4,
