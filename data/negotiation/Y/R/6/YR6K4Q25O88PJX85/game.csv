"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $130 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $135?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $135 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $142?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",142.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $135 for this product. I hope you can accommodate this price point.",135.0,Bob,6,
