,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get close to your asking price, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we compromise at $78? I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer, but I can't go much further.",78.0,Bob,4,
