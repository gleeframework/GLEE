"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This achieves a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  It helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to increase our offer gradually.
* **Aims for a good deal:** Ideally, we want to buy the product for considerably less than our maximum budget of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $85 is still above her value for the product ($80). We can likely negotiate a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $70 is a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? "",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  We don't want to jump up too quickly, so we increase our offer by $8. 
* **Target below Alice's value:** This offer is still below Alice's value of $80, giving her an incentive to accept.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're mindful of the remaining rounds and want to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $78 is still a bit low for me.  How about $82? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $82, which is very close to her value of $80.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. We've managed to get a price significantly lower than John's offer ($120) and our initial goal. Accepting now secures a good deal."
