"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's start with $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least cover my minimum value of $1,200,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000, and $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  However,  $1,150,000 still falls short of my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's finalize this deal at my minimum price, and I'll ensure you receive a product that exceeds your expectations.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I've been trying to negotiate, but it seems like Alice is firm on her minimum price. Since I've already considered buying the product from John for $1,200,000, and this is the same price Alice is offering, I think it's time to take the deal. I'll accept Alice's offer.
