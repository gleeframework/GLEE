"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from that price. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  Consider it a final offer from my side.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
