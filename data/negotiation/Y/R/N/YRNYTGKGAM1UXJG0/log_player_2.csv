Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  Consider it a final offer from my side.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,150,000. While a deal at $1,100,000 would be ideal, I can secure the product from John for $1,200,000 with no further negotiation. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal with John than to risk Alice walking away and potentially ending up with no deal at all."
