"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of you to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $11,000 to $10,500, which is closer to your desired price point.
* Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000.
* While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying more or even losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether."
