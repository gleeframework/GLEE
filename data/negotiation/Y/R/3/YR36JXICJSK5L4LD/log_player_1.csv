Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000, reflecting the product's true worth. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite convinced it's worth $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is at the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, there's no guarantee of a better offer in the next rounds. It's more strategically sound to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John now."
