"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
