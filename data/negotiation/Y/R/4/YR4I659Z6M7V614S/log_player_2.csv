# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its potential value to me. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 undervalues the inherent worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This adjusted price takes into account its unique value proposition while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,150,000 is still above my budget, and I'm determined to get it below $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably offer.  Let's compromise at $950,000.
