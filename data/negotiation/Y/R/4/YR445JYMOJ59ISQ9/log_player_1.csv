Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $110. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's value but below my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I leave room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm also setting the tone for a fair and mutually beneficial exchange. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my price downwards or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $100, which is still above Bob's value but closer to his offer.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and acknowledge his offer, but I'm also emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum value. 

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with a slight decrease, I'm showing flexibility while maintaining a strong position.  If Bob accepts, I get a decent price. If he rejects, I can decide if I want to make another offer or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $90 is a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I've already negotiated with Bob and it seems unlikely he'll budge much further.  To guarantee a fair price and avoid further haggling, I'm choosing to sell to John at $120. This ensures I get my minimum value and eliminates any risk of further price reductions."
