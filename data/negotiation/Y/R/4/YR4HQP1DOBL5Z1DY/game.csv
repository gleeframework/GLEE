"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $120 to you, but we're starting our negotiations at a special introductory price of $110. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a competitive rate. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we set the price for the product at $107? This is a fair compromise considering both our positions.",107.0,Alice,3,
