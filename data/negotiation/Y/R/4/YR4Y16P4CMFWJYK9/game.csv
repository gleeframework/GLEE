"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I think it's a fair offer considering what you'll gain from it.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a win-win situation for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. How about we try $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could consider letting it go for $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but no higher. That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
