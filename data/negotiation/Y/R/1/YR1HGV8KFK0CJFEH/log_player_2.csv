{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $15,000.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.
* However, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000 (her value).
* You are willing to pay up to $15,000.
* A counter-offer of $10,000 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation but also shows you're serious about buying the product."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,500 is still better than John's offer of $15,000.
* However, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. 
* Rejecting her offer allows you to try to get closer to your target price of $10,000 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is closer to your desired price of $10,000.
* Counteroffering at $11,000 shows you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.
* This price is likely still within Alice's acceptable range, as she rejected your $10,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is still better than John's offer of $15,000.
* While you might be able to squeeze out a lower price with more counteroffers, the risk is that Alice might get frustrated and stop negotiating.
* At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option to secure the product at a good price."
