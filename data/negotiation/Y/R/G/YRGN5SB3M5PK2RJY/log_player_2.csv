"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth a significant amount to me, potentially even more than $1500000. I'm confident it could be extremely valuable to you as well.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.  This is a great price considering its potential value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'll be paying $200,000 more than I need to, and I don't know if the product is worth that much to her, so I'm not convinced it's worth that much to me either. I'll wait and see what else is out there.
