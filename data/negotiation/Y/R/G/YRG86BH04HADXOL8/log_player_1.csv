Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While I'm motivated to sell, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $8,800 in the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,900 is closer to my minimum goal, I'm still hopeful I can secure a price closer to $9,000 in the remaining rounds.  I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and it's clear he's not willing to budge much further. It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid further risk of losing money if the negotiations with Bob continue to drag on."
