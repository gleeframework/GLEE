Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. I'm proposing $925,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find common ground and close this deal.
