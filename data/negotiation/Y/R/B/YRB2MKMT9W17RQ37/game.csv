"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring you significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,450,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my budget limitations.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I'd like to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,380,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value you'll get from this product.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
