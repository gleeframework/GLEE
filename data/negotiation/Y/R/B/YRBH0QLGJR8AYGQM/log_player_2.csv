"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to potentially reach a better price. 
* **Buying from John is an option:** You can always buy from John if the negotiations fail, ensuring you get the product at your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Starting with a lower price puts pressure on Alice and shows your commitment to a good deal. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $950,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and still represents a profit for her. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to you strengthens your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** You can always buy from John if negotiations fail, ensuring you get the product at your target price. 

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and your potential profits. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your final offer before you switch to buying from John. It's a firm price that reflects your maximum budget. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and conveys your willingness to compromise while staying firm on your price.
* **Emphasize Value:** Highlighting the value for both parties strengthens your position and encourages Alice to accept."
