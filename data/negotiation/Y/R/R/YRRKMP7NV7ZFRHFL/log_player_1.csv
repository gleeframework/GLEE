Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:**  I highlight the product's potential worth to Bob, hoping to spark his interest.
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer leaves open the possibility of negotiating further if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

**Note:**  This strategy balances the desire to maximize profit with the need to be reasonable and avoid alienating Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and weigh it against the potential of selling to John for $15,000."
