Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1,000,000.  I believe it's a strong investment for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant mark-up from my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to both of us. This sets the stage for a collaborative negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit. If he accepts, great! If not, I can then adjust my offer based on his counter-offer or move on to John for a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer, aiming to secure a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it shows you understand the value of this product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a successful agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I start by thanking Bob for his offer, showing respect and building rapport.
* **Counter with a Compromise:** I propose a middle ground at $1,150,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Highlight the Benefit:** I reiterate that this is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'd gain from the product. 

This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable price while moving the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and I am willing to increase my offer to $1,125,000. This still keeps the investment within my desired budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my desired price point. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is high. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Profit Margin:**  $1,125,000 is significantly above my minimum of $1,000,000, giving me a good profit margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more back-and-forth, potentially wasting time and energy.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I continue to reject offers, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's $1,000,000 offer.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on a sale."
