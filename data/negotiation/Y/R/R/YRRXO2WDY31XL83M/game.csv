"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this acquisition will be highly beneficial for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is a bit beyond my budget.  Given my research on similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true potential and unique aspects of what's being offered.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,700,000. This represents a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,500,000. This represents a significant commitment on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
