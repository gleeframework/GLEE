"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this acquisition will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth going through at least one round of counteroffers before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is a bit beyond my budget.  Given my research on similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true potential and unique aspects of what's being offered.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,700,000. This represents a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the inherent value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,500,000. This represents a significant commitment on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
