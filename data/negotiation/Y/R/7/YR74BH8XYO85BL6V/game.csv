"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll still be able to make a good profit. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer, but unfortunately $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $825,000? That way, we both come out with a good deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
