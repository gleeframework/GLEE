"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about $15,500? That's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget. Could we meet halfway and settle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,750 is still a little too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,
