Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. You should make a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $12,000?"",

This counter-offer attempts to move the price significantly closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14,000 is my ideal price, I could be persuaded to go down to $13,000.  This product would bring you a lot of value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice has come down in price, you're still getting closer to John's price. It's worth making another counteroffer to see if you can meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?"",

This counter-offer aims for a price directly in the middle of the previous offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still pursuing a more beneficial price."
