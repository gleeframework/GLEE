I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum value, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $125. This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, but still allow me to make a profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although $110 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. Although it's only slightly above my minimum value, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price from John.  It's a good deal considering how the negotiation is going."
