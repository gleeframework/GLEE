"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This gives you a good price and ensures I can still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
