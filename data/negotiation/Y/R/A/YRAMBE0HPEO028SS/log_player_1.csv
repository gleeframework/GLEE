{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  It also leaves a good profit margin for me, as the product is worth at least $8,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This gives you a good price and ensures I can still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
