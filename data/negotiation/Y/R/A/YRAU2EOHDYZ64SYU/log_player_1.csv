Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is less than my minimum price of $12,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's maximum budget is $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll also try to create a sense of urgency to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget of $8,000, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my best and final offer for now. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit above my target, though.  How about $9000?  I think that's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable range. I'll also try to create a sense of scarcity to see if Bob is willing to meet me at my minimum price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I have to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I've already mentioned this to you, and I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's as low as I can go.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.
