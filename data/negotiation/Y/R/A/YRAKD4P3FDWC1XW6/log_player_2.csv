"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to start with an offer of $20,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is significantly more than his budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm happy to consider it if we can work towards a more reasonable price. How about $12,000? It's a good starting point for us to explore a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value to me is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $16,000 is still above his budget. He can try to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $17,000? This is as low as I can go for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $17,000 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
