Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 
 
Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:** By beginning at $15,000, I'm aiming for a significant profit margin while leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a price well above my minimum.
* **Expressing Value:** I highlight the product's ""worth"" to subtly anchor Bob's perception of its value at a higher point.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  While my initial price is firm, I signal that I'm willing to engage in a dialogue, making Bob more likely to counter and stay engaged.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides me with a safety net. If Bob's offers fall below a certain threshold, I can confidently walk away knowing I have an alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a solid offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates he sees the value in the product, so I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  I value this product at a higher point. Would you consider $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.  
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still holding firm above the $12,000 mark to emphasize the product's worth and aim for a higher profit.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""willing to be flexible"" encourages a collaborative tone and keeps the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $12,800 represents a $2,800 profit, which is a significant return.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, especially since he's anchored himself around the $12,000 mark. It's unlikely we'll see a jump much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further back-and-forth consumes time that could be spent pursuing other deals or opportunities. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $12,800 represents a good balance between profit and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
