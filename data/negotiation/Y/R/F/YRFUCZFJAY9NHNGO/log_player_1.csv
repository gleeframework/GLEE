Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,250,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price feels more aligned with the value I see it bringing to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
