"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,250,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price feels more aligned with the value I see it bringing to my business.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still below the value I need to receive for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which reflects the potential we've discussed. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential benefits we've discussed.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
