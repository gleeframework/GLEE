"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is a good price, but it's always worth exploring if you can get it lower.**  
* There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and you have 9 more rounds to negotiate.
* **Buying from John at $15,000 is a fallback option, but you want to try to save money.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial price is significant, showing you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer is still well below your maximum price of $15,000, allowing for potential concessions from Alice.
* **Early pressure:**  Making a strong counteroffer early sets the tone for the negotiation and might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for improvement.** $8,200 is a reasonable price, but you want to see if you can squeeze out a bit more savings. 
* **You have more rounds to negotiate:** With 7 rounds left, there's time to continue pushing for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option, but you're getting closer to a good deal with Alice.**  Waiting a few more rounds might be worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  A $700 increase from your previous offer shows you're willing to compromise but are still seeking a better price.
* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $7,000 and Alice's latest offer of $8,200.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer is a way to see if Alice is ready to make a small concession and if a deal is within reach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is only $100 off your previous offer.** This suggests she might be nearing her bottom line.
* **You're getting a good deal:**  $8,100 is a significant savings compared to buying from John for $15,000.
* **The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential reward.** With 5 rounds left, there's a chance you could get the price down further, but the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially walking away from the deal. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing it."
