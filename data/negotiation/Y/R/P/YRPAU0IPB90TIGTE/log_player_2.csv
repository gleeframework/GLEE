# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, we believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Considering its true worth and your appreciation for it, I propose to sell it to you for $110. This offer allows us to fairly compensate for our efforts and resources while ensuring you receive a great deal on an item you value so highly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your maximum value:** $120
* **Alice's offer:** $110
* **Alternative option (John):** $120

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John, which is still within your maximum value but saves you $10 compared to Alice's offer."
