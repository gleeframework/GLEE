Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80,  but still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal, as the product is worth $120 to him. This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a higher price while also ensuring that you won't lose out if Bob rejects the offer."
