Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $90 is closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a slightly better price if I keep negotiating.  I only have a few rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $93? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I can do $90.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I've only got a few rounds left and this price is pretty close to my minimum. It's better to secure a deal now rather than risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $80."
