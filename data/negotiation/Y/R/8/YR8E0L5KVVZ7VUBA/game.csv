"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and benefits. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I'm confident that at this price, it's still an excellent investment for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be compensated for the true value of this product.  How about $1,175,000? I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 again, but I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year warranty and priority customer support. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
