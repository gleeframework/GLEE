{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll try to counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $108 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to pay $107 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $120,  Bob's offer of $107 is close enough to my minimum value of $120 that I'm willing to accept it.  It's better than risking losing the deal entirely."
