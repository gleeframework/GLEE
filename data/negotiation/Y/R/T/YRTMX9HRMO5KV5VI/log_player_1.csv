Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else. Considering its value, I'm offering it at $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he negotiates. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's little risk in aiming higher with Bob.
* **Value Justification:** While brief, the message hints at the product's value, which can help justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, don't go below your $15,000 minimum, as you have a guaranteed sale at that price from John."
