"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $12000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $12500, which is a good compromise.  It's close to my budget and hopefully still makes this a worthwhile deal for you.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'll meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $13250. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
