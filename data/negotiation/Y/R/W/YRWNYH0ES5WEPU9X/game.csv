"Hey Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $155 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $140. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
