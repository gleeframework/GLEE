Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell below that price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I don't have information about Bob's financial situation or how much he's willing to pay. If I had that information, I could tailor my offer more precisely."
