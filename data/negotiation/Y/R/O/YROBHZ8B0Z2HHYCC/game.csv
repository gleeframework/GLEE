"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product to you for $975,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual interest in closing this deal. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,7,
