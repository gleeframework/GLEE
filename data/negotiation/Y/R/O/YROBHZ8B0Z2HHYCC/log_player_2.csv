{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's better to reject and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product to you for $975,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price range, $975,000 is still above my limit.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate further. I'm mindful of the fact that I can always buy from John for $800,000, which gives me some leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual interest in closing this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my budget. With only a few rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and could lead to me missing out on the deal. Accepting her offer allows me to secure the product while still saving a significant amount compared to her initial asking price. Additionally, it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $800,000."
