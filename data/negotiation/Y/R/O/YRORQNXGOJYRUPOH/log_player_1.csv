Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (anything less and you sell to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $800,000
* **Your Guarantee:** John ensures you'll get your minimum.

**Strategy**

You want to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay before he walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to start high.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** By starting significantly above Bob's perceived value, you establish the product as potentially very valuable.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" add a sense of prestige and desirability.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the price leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. If he counters, you can gauge his seriousness and adjust accordingly, never going below your $1,000,000 safety net.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round offer in the given scenario. In real-world negotiations, multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers are common."
