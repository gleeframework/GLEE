"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we split the difference at $12,250? This would still allow me to get a good price, and it's closer to what you're looking for. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to work with me, Alice.  $12,250 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
