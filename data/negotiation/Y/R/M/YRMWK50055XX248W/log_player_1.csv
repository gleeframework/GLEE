Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  You want at least $800,000, so this is a good start.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** Bob values it at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential back and forth without immediately pushing Bob away. 

Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than what I want to achieve.  I want to try and push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This keeps the price higher than my minimum while still giving Bob a good deal.  Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:

This is a good deal for me.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer of $980,000. This is well above my minimum price of $800,000.  It's time to close the deal!"
