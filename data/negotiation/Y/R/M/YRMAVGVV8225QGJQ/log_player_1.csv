Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I am proposing an offer of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, however, $750,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to your business."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. I am willing to offer $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $850,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
