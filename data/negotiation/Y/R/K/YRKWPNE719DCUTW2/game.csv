"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking $1,450,000 is a fair price for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,500,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to go that high, I might have to consider my other options. ",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,475,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
