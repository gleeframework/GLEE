"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's significantly lower than your estimated value, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your estimated value and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a significant discount from your estimated value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still getting a significant discount from my estimated value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
