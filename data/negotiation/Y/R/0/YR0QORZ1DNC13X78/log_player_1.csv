""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,000,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Profit Maximization:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $150,000) while maximizing your potential profit.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
