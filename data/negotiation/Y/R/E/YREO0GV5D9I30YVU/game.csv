"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. This is the lowest I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
