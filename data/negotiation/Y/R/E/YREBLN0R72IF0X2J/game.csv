"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but I need to recoup more of my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $18000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer!  $16000 is tempting, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $17000?  I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach my target.  Let's make this happen!",17000.0,Alice,5,
