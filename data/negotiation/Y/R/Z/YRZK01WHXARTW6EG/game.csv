"Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects its substantial value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for its value.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,100,000?  This would still be a significant saving for you compared to the product's full potential value, and it allows me to secure a decent return. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. I'd like to propose an alternative: $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a significant saving compared to the original offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your proposed price, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $950,000. It's simply not a sufficient return on this product's value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer - let's settle on $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,025,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $1,500,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
