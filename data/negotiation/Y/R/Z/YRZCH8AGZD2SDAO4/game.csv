"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000.  It's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm interested in the product and believe it has value, but I'm prepared to offer $900000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
