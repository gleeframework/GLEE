You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible price.  A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum value. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating Bob's willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $108, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product at a good price without further negotiation."
