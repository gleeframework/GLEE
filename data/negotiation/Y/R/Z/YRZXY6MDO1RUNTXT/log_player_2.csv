Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value you've placed on this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident that this is a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value we've both established for this product, I'm willing to go down to $10,000 one last time.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is sticking to $10,000, which is still higher than my target.  Given that I have limited rounds left, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John at $8,000."
