"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,150,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
