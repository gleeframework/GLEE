"Alice, $14,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm really interested in this product, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price that's closer to my budget, and hopefully we can make this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
