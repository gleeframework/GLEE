"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle somewhere.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,500. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,500. How about we try $13,750? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need at least $14,500 for this to work.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,750 and $14,500. How about we try $14,125? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $14,125 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to come down to $14,312.50. This is a great deal for both of us. I don't think we can get any closer, so let's finalize this deal.",14312.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,312.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,125 and $14,312.50. How about we try $14,218.75? I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14218.75,Bob,8,
