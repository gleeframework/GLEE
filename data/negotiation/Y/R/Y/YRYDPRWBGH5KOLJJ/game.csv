"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm still confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This would allow us to close the deal and ensure both of us benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $825,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Alice,5,
