"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $12,500? It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. How about we settle on $12,250? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a great deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
