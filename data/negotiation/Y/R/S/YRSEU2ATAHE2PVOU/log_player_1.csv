"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,750,000.  It's a great opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1750000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and aim for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. I'm sure we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price.  Accepting his offer guarantees me the best possible outcome at this point."
