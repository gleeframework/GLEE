"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation. Bob has 9 more rounds to try to get a better price before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as low as possible.  He knows Alice's minimum acceptable price is $800,000, so he starts by offering $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this sets a lower benchmark for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can likely get it even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  He still has 7 rounds left, giving him plenty of time to try and reach an agreement that benefits him more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows Alice's minimum price is $800,000. This offer is at that price point, leaving no room for Alice to negotiate down further. It's a risky move, but it could potentially lead to a quick agreement.  If Alice rejects, Bob has 6 rounds remaining to adjust his strategy if needed."
