Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $110 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  I've also indicated I'm open to negotiation, which might make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to go higher."
