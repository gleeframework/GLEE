"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting her initial offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  By offering $900,000, you are significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This gives her room to negotiate while also showing you are serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you believe is fair.  By rejecting again, you can continue to negotiate with Alice and potentially secure a price closer to your target.  Keep in mind that you could still end up buying from John, but this gives you more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

You've shown Alice you're serious about negotiating, and she's come down a bit.  This counteroffer shows you're willing to budge, but not by a lot. This keeps the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal completely.  It also brings you closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is getting very close to your desired price point.  Further negotiation could potentially get you a better deal, but it's risky.  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower offer, and you might lose the chance to buy from Alice altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's well within your budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
