"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. That's my final offer, let me know if you can meet me there.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $130 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference and go with $140. This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, that's my final offer.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $140.  If you're not interested at that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",140.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $140, which is $137.50. That's my final offer.",137.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $137.50 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to have to stick to my price of $140. If you're not willing to pay that, I'm going to have to sell to another buyer.",140.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $137.50. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I'm willing to walk away from the deal.",137.5,Bob,10,
