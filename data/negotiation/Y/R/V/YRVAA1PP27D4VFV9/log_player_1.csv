"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. I'm offering the product at a price that is higher than what Bob values it at, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest without immediately going for my full asking price.  I'm also keeping in mind the 10 round limit and the option to sell to John, so I need to be strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity. I am willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm aiming for a higher price. Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially leads to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would give us both a good deal and ensure a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Fairness:**  $9,000 is still significantly more than Bob's valuation, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than his offer. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm framing the offer as a positive outcome for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit. This helps build rapport and increases the chance of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to propose $8,500 as my offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 6 rounds left and still haven't reached my desired price. 

* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a better deal with Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and explore if we can find a mutually agreeable price point. 

I believe that by continuing the negotiation, I have a better chance of achieving a price that is closer to my valuation, even if it means going back and forth a few more times."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and would allow both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm raising my offer by a smaller amount this time, only $500, to signal that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal. This suggests I'm willing to be flexible but still value the product highly.
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair"" price and a win-win situation, aiming to encourage Bob to compromise.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes a more attractive option. This counteroffer is a last attempt to reach a deal with Bob without losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm determined to see if I can push for a higher price.

* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I believe that continuing to negotiate can lead to a better outcome. There's a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer further, especially as the rounds are getting fewer.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $12,000 would be a guaranteed win, I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting closer to my desired price with Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  With 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing to make a decision. However, I still see an opportunity to get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's value.  To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This would give you a great deal and allow me to ensure the product goes to someone who truly values it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous round to show willingness to compromise but still maintain a value higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to make progress without jeopardizing my minimum price. This counteroffer is a firm but reasonable stance.
* **Final Push:** This could be the last opportunity to get closer to my desired price before selling to John becomes the more appealing option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still falling short of my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. 

* **Time Pressure:** The clock is ticking, and I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose money.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer in the next round, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit and move on."
