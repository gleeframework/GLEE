"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below the value I'm confident this product will bring to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached a point where I'm willing to sell to John for the same amount.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing this sale. I'm going to sell to John and avoid any further negotiation."
