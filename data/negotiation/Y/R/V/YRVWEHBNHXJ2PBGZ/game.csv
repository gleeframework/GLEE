This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering! The product looks interesting, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,250. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting a bit tedious. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have a firm budget. My final offer is $8,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",8000.0,Bob,6,
