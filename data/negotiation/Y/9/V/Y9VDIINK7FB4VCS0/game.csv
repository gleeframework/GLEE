"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to go down to $8500? I'm hoping to save some money, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  I'm willing to be flexible, and I think this price is still a great value for such a fantastic product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $8750. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $8750 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet at $8900?  That's only $150 more than your last offer, and it's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I really want to buy this product from you.  However, I'm still not quite there at $8900.  Would you be willing to come down just a little more to $8800? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
