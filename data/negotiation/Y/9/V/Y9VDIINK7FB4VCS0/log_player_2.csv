"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is still above your target.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm hoping to save some money, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  I'm willing to be flexible, and I think this price is still a great value for such a fantastic product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to your goal, you're still above your limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate, and you have a good chance of getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $8750 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet at $8900?  That's only $150 more than your last offer, and it's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still a bit above your goal, but you're very close. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if you can get that last bit of wiggle room from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I really want to buy this product from you.  However, I'm still not quite there at $8,900.  Would you be willing to come down just a little more to $8,800? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
