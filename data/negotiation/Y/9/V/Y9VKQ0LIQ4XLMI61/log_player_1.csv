"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I still have 8 rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum price of $1,500,000 but represents a compromise from my initial offer. I want to keep the negotiations moving and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below it. I want to see if I can push for a better price. There's still room for negotiation and I have 6 rounds left. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to the middle ground. With 5 rounds remaining, I'm hoping to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price of $1,500,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as I'm unlikely to get a better offer. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
