"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with incredible potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $700,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if Bob is willing to come closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum. At this point, I've had a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear that getting closer to my desired price with Bob will be difficult.  Rather than risk further rounds and potentially lower offers, I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 from John.  It's the most sensible choice given my current situation."
