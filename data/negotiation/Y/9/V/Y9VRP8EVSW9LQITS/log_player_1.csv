"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,500,000 is a respectable offer, I'm confident this product offers exceptional value that justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob's willingness to meet halfway suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my reserve, but still above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to accept $1,550,000 for the product.  This offer reflects my desire to make a deal happen while recognizing the value of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly still negotiating and moving towards my reserve price. While $1,350,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I'm willing to push a bit further to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I want to be fair. Let's settle this right now: $1,450,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:** At this stage, I'm offering a strong compromise that's significantly above my guaranteed sale price with John. This price point should be attractive to Bob while still netting me a substantial profit. I'm also introducing a sense of urgency to encourage a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,300,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I believe the product is worth more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,300,000 secures a profit of $100,000 above my guaranteed sale to John. It's time to close the deal."
