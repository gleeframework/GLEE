"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,750 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
