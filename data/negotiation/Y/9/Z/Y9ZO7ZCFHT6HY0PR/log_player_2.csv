"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something unique and valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's tempting to go with the first offer, but Bob has the upper hand as he knows the product is worth no more than $100. There's no reason to rush into buying when he can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! It's tempting, but I'm looking to get a better price. How about $80? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make sure I get a good value for my product. How about we meet in the middle at 85? It's still a great deal, and I think we can both be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He's still within his budget, and Alice is showing flexibility.  There's a good chance he can get it for less than $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $82.  I'm serious about wanting to buy this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I'm not willing to go below 87. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the quality. How about we meet in the middle again at 86.50? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate.  He's still saving money compared to John, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.  There's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to work with me. Let's meet in the middle again, how about $84? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 84}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go below 85.50. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the product. How about we meet in the middle again at 85.25? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal, but Alice is clearly firm on her price.  At this point, continuing to negotiate is risky, and there's a chance he could lose the deal entirely.  It's safer to accept the offer and save $4.75 compared to John."
