Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting with an offer of $25,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 25000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's try $20,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it still represents a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $20000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, $17,000 is a good compromise, and getting closer to my initial target.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and I still have several rounds to potentially increase the price further."
