"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is willing to sell it for $140. While this is a good deal, you can potentially save even more money by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $130 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's still more than what the product is worth to her ($100), but significantly lower than her initial offer ($140). This gives her an incentive to accept, but still allows me to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is a better deal than what John is offering ($150).  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. It's more likely she'll either reject my counteroffer or stick to this price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product to John."
