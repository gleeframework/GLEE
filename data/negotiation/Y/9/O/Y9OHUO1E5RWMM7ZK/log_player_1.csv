I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This gives Bob a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."

Bob's offer is too low, but I want to see if I can get him to come up. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, so hopefully he'll see it as a good compromise."
