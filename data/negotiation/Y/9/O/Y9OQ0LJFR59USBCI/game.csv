"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $1,400,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Could you consider something closer to $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,600,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,600,000 even? This would be my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
