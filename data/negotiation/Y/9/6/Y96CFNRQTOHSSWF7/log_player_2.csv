"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $950,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a great compromise.

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He should continue to negotiate by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

```

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above it.  Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. This will save him $75,000 and is the best option given his limited budget."
