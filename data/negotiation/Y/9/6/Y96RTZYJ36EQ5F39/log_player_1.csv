Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still far from my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but accepting $725,000 would be leaving a lot of money on the table."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I could make this work for $825,000.  Do you think we can agree on that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $825,000 is tempting, I believe the product is worth pushing for a bit more. Bob's message indicates he's willing to stretch his budget, so I'll try one more time to land closer to my target."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close!  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further and offer you $815,000.  Let's close this deal!

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and the difference is now relatively small. Accepting $815,000 is a solid deal, and it's better to secure the sale now than risk losing him entirely in the remaining rounds."
