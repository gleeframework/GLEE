"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
