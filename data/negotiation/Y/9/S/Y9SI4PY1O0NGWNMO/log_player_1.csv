"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I value the product at. I will reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount and still provides you with substantial value.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,200,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at the minimum I value the product at, so I will accept.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, it's better than rejecting the offer and risking further negotiation with a potential counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower."
