Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, $8000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something unique.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  It's a fair price considering my budget constraints and the fact that I'm genuinely interested in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $10000.  This is a fair price considering the product and my maximum budget. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $10000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you can see the value in the product at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
