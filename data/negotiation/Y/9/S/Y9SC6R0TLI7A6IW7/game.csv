"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity to potentially acquire it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $950000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to my initial asking price of $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
