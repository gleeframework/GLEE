Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has a lot of potential value, and I believe it could be a great asset for you. My asking price is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($1,200,000) to give myself room to negotiate down. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, which is important in a negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's within my acceptable range, I might accept. If not, I'll make a counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll have to decide if it's worth continuing with Bob or taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity to potentially acquire it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's rejection indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $800,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $950,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to my initial asking price of $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is strategic:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm also not rejecting it outright. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $1,075,000 is exactly halfway between my initial asking price of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still seeking a good price for the product.
* **Reiteration of value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the counteroffer and encourage him to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a further counteroffer. If negotiations stall, I'll decide whether to accept John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your perspective on the product's value. I would like to counter with an offer of $1025000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford while still staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 than my initial asking price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is a solid starting point for potential further negotiations. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $800,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer, as it's a good price that is likely to be difficult to improve upon further. While I'm always open to negotiation, I want to ensure I don't risk losing the deal altogether."
