Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,500,000 is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can push for more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
