I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more from Bob, especially since we have several rounds left."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm making a slight concession, but still aiming for a price above John's offer.  With only a few rounds left, I want to show I'm serious about getting a deal, but also keep some leverage."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is now the same as John's. I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds, so I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
