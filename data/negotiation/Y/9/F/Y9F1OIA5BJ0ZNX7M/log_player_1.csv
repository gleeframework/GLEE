Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your price, even if it's a simple statement of value, can make your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay and help you determine your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and open the door for a potential counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, but not drastically. 
* **Incremental Steps:**  Coming down by $15 suggests you're flexible but still value the product. This approach leaves room for Bob to potentially counter again.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** The goal is to secure a price as close to $150 as possible while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $125 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($100), securing you a solid profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob losing interest or only offering very small increases, making the extra effort not worthwhile. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While you could aim for a higher price, accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely, forcing you to settle for John's $100 offer."
