"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that I think is fair. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
