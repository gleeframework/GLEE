Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a price that is above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a high price while remaining reasonable and leaving room for counter-offers.  This approach balances maximizing your profit while ensuring the negotiation stays productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price.  While I'd like to close the deal, selling for less than $1,500,000 is not acceptable.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further haggling is not worth the potential loss.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is a better outcome than potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
