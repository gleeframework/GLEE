Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This gives him a good deal, as it's still below his value of $120, and it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also leaving some room for a potential counteroffer, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum of $100 and represents a good deal for me. It's also likely that further negotiation could result in a lower price or even a rejection from Bob, leading me to sell to John for $100.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
