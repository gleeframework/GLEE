"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for a product like this.  Would you be willing to come down significantly on the price?",5000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $5,000, but I'm afraid that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this high-quality product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we try to find a compromise somewhere around $7,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to try to find a middle ground, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter offer. It seems like we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500?  That's a price I'm comfortable with, and it would allow me to close the deal today.",8500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,9000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,,
