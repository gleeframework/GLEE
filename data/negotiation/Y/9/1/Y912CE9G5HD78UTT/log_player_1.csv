Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999. I think it could really benefit you and it's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a ""take it or leave it"" price, we increase the chance of Bob accepting. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While unlikely, the slight discount from $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting a small deal, potentially increasing his willingness to accept.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's true valuation and that you are prioritizing a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000 if Bob declines."
