Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, which could encourage him to make a counteroffer. 
* **Product description:** I'm leaving the product description vague.  I want to get Bob interested before revealing too much information that might give away my minimum price. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while giving myself room to adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to my initial asking price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price, $8,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference:**  Offering to split the difference between my initial asking price and Bob's counteroffer shows that I'm flexible and willing to meet halfway.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Fair deal:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both parties can make it more appealing to Bob. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a sale closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $8500. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my initial counteroffer of $9,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, accepting this offer is still a good outcome:

* **It's above my minimum:**  $8,500 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It avoids further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away altogether or lowering his offer further.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  This offer represents a reasonable compromise between our initial positions.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
