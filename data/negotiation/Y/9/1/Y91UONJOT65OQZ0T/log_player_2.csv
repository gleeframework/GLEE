"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This exceptional item holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am confident it would be a perfect fit for your needs. Given its significance and rarity, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this figure strikes a fair balance between acknowledging its true value to you and ensuring a reasonable return for my investment. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which saves him $250,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is not optimal:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he will have to buy from John for $1,200,000. This is more expensive than Alice's offer. 
* **Buying from John is not necessary:** Since Alice is offering a price that is within Bob's budget and saves him money, there is no need to buy from John."
