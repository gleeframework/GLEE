Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $15,000, starting with a higher offer ($20,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $15,000. This allows me to be more assertive in my pricing with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value, which might make Bob more receptive to a higher price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept."
