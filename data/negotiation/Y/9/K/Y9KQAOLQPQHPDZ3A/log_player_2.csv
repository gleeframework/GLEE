"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. Since you know John will sell the product for $15,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always go to John if you don't reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price, aiming to push Alice to lower her expectations. You're indicating a willingness to negotiate while still remaining within your budget limit. This aggressive approach will likely prompt Alice to counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $12000 is really my minimum. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13500? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You have more rounds to negotiate and can continue to push for a lower price. There's no need to settle just yet, especially since you have the option of buying from John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

By splitting the difference, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your budget. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward and increase the likelihood of a deal within your desired price range."
