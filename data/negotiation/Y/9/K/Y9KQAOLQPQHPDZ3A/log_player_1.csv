Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,000 is really my minimum. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12750? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
