Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $10,000. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at your true value leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price between $10,000 and $8,000. This allows for a potential win-win scenario where you earn slightly more than your minimum and Bob gets a small discount.
* **Maintain a Good Relationship:** Offering a ""special price"" can foster goodwill with Bob, even if he ultimately declines. 
 
**Important Note:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and potential to negotiate during your interactions. If it seems unlikely he'll agree to a price close to $10,000, you can always adjust your strategy in subsequent messages."
