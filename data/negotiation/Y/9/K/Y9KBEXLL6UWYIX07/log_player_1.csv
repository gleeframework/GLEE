Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll aim to get a good profit. I'll offer it to him for $18,000.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I still want to maximize my profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I think I can do better than $13,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $16,000. This is still higher than his original offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I still want to squeeze out a bit more profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I think I can do better than $14,500. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $15,500. This is still a bit higher than his original offer, and I hope it will be enough to convince him to meet me in the middle.
