"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $700,000 falls significantly short of what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential for a return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I could consider going up to $800,000. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",800000.0,Bob,4,
