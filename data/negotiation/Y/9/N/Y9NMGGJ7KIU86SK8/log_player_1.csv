Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, potentially making him more likely to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit, but also want to give Bob a chance to purchase the product. 
* Starting at $1,000,000 allows for potential negotiation without immediately resorting to selling to John for $1,200,000. 
* If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to settle yet. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 if I continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to accept the first counteroffer. This can potentially lead to a better negotiation position in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $950,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still provide you with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but haven't completely yielded.
* **The message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but also express my own needs. It's still friendly and leaves room for further discussion. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my target:** While $950,000 is still below my desired price, it's a significant step closer to it. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise further. If he accepts, it's a good deal for me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not accepting his first counteroffer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell, which could help me get a higher price in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is still significantly less than my desired price of $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategic choice in this scenario. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he may walk away or offer a lower price in the future. There's no guarantee that I'll get closer to my target price by rejecting his offer. 
* **Time Value:** Every round of negotiation consumes time. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid further delays.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While $925,000 is not ideal, it's still a considerable profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to a lower price or even the need to sell to John for $1,200,000, resulting in a loss.

By accepting Bob's offer, I maximize my profit in this situation while minimizing the risk of losing a potential buyer altogether."
