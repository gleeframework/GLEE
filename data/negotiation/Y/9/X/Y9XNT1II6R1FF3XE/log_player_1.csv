Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a strong starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential profit for Bob. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so he's likely to counter-offer. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Maximizes potential profit:** By starting high, I increase the chances of achieving a final price closer to my desired value.
* **Provides a fallback option:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000, guaranteeing I don't lose out on a significant profit."
