"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. How about $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit without sacrificing too much. Let's try to find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am too. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8750 is still a little too low for me. Let's compromise at $8900. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8700 is still a little too low for me. I'm confident that this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. Let's settle on $8800. This price would be fair to both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,7,
