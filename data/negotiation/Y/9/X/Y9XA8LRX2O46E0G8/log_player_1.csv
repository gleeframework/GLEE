While Bob's offer is closer to my acceptable range, it's still below my desired profit margin.  It's worth exploring if we can reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,000,000 at this point.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my target."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my acceptable range, but it's still not quite there.  While I could continue negotiating,  it's becoming time-consuming and I have a guaranteed offer from John that's much closer to my desired price. I'll accept John's offer and move on."
