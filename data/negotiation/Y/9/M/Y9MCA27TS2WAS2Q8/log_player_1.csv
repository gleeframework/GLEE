Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This offer reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This allows us both to benefit from the deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but I'm still only able to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

``` 

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $13,000. Accepting his offer would result in a $2,000 loss compared to selling to John. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
