"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $22,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This offer reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial $22,000, it's still above his budget. He has the option to buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above his comfort zone.  He can always buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but I'm still only able to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
