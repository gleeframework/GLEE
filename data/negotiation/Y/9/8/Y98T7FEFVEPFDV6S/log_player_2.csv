{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range.  While it's tempting to accept, you have room to negotiate and potentially save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that's potentially acceptable to her. This allows me to establish a lower price point while still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to my desired price range. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm going to counter again to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise.  However, I'm staying below $1,000,000 to try and incentivize Alice to come down further.  It's a delicate balance between getting a good price and potentially pushing Alice to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is now within my acceptable range. While I would ideally like to pay less, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product while still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
