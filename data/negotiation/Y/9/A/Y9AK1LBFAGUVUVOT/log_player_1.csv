Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, I need to be firmer in my pricing.  Would you consider $1,112,500?  This keeps us moving but acknowledges your desire for a lower price point."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,112,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on that, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to $1.1 million, Bob is signaling this is his final offer. Accepting $1,090,000 is a significant profit over my minimum ($800,000) and a good deal overall. Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks losing the sale entirely."
