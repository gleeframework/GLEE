"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save money.  $200 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $170? It's a fantastic product and you won't regret it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $170 is still above Bob's budget.  While the product is likely good, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has a few rounds left and could potentially get a better deal with Alice or simply buy from John for $150 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but $155 is the absolute most I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
