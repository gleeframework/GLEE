Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is still lower than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob a chance to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Protecting my minimum:** My minimum is $1,000,000, so I have room to negotiate down if necessary without losing money. 
* **Introducing John as a potential backup:** I mention John to subtly remind Bob that I have other options, increasing the pressure for him to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, so I'm not losing money by rejecting.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate upward. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **No rush to sell:** I'm not under any time pressure, so I can afford to be patient and see if we can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,125,000. That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my desired price:** I'm raising the price slightly, but still keeping it within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Offering a compromise:**  ""Splitting the difference"" suggests a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on finding a common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,075,000? That's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $75,000 below my minimum of $1,000,000.  This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or that we'll get stuck in a prolonged negotiation.
* **John is still a backup:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I know I can always sell to John if something falls through."
