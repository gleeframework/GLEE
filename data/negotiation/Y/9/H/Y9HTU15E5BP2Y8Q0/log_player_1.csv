Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($12,000) increases the likelihood of a sale while maximizing profit.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so I can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $11,500 offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price."
