Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Safety Net:** I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. 

This approach aims to get the best possible price while maintaining a friendly and open negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is too far off. There's still room for negotiation to find a price that's closer to my value.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit, so I can afford to be firm with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my negotiating position and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $140, showing flexibility.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing reasoning for my counteroffer,  highlighting the value of the product and suggesting a fair price.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks lowering the price even further, potentially below my minimum.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a safe and profitable outcome, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

By selling to John, I secure a certain profit and avoid the potential of a lower price from Bob."
