"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $700,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the negotiation could drag on indefinitely and I might end up with less than what John is offering. It's better to be certain of a guaranteed $800,000 than to risk a lower price with further negotiation."
