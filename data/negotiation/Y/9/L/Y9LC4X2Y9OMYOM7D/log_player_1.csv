"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000 to reflect its worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a strong negotiating position and leaves room for concessions.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" without being too specific. This justifies the high price without revealing my bottom line.
* **Leaving Room:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I have 10 rounds to potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate a price closer to the market value. I propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price and John's offer, it's still early in the negotiation.  There's room to explore if Bob is willing to go higher.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show flexibility while still aiming above Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your proposed price, I believe this product offers significant value beyond typical market comparisons.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):**  I've lowered my price significantly to show flexibility and movement towards Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly pushing back on the ""market value"" argument, reminding Bob of the product's unique aspects.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still keeps me significantly above both my minimum and Bob's initial proposal, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's aim for a compromise that respects both our interests. I would like to suggest a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer is now $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to my price range, indicating a willingness to make a deal.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures a good profit, whereas continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks Bob walking away or stalling until it's too late to sell to John."
