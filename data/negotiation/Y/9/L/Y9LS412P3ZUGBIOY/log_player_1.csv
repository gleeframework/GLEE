{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you space to negotiate downward if needed, but still ensures you make a decent profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and avoids any confusion. 

It's important to be prepared to negotiate further, and consider your backup option with John to help guide your decisions."
