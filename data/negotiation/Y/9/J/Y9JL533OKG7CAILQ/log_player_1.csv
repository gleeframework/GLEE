"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is a bold opening move that allows for potential negotiation down the line. I'm aiming to secure a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This strategy ensures I have room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I'm also aware of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. This provides a safety net and allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000 and even lower than the guaranteed price from John.  It's not a viable option for me.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,500,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer and my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and secure a price closer to my ideal target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price and matches the guaranteed price from John.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees a successful sale and minimizes risk.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob, especially as we're nearing the middle of the 10 rounds."
