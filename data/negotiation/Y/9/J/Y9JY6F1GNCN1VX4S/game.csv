"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for this exceptional product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product brings, while being more attainable for you.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which represents a fair compromise for both of us. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe this price accurately reflects its value.  Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save some money. How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to a deal. While I appreciate your budget constraints,  $1,250,000 just won't work for me.  I'm prepared to make one final concession - how about $1,325,000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's finalize this agreement. ",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but no lower. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm getting a bit concerned that I might be leaving money on the table if I go any lower. Can you meet me at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
