"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $77.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",77.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $77.50 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $70 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $75. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",75.0,Alice,5,
