"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,025,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about we settle on $1,075,000? This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
