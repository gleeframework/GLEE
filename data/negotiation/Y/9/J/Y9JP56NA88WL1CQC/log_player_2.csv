"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's above her own valuation of $800,000, and I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still quite high. I can likely get it for a lower price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,025,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about we settle on $1,075,000? This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within my budget and a decent price. It's still a bit high, but I don't want to risk losing the opportunity. If I reject this, she might not counteroffer again, and I'd have to buy from John at a much higher price."
