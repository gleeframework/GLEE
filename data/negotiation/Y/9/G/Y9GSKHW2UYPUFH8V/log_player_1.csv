Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```tool_code
Explanation:
While a higher price is ideal, Bob has made it clear that $120 is his maximum. Accepting his offer of $150 secures a profit above our minimum acceptable price.
