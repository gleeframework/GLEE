"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that can be a real asset to your business. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price that's still below my minimum acceptable amount ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm framing the offer by mentioning the product's value to Bob's business. This creates a sense of mutual benefit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message expresses willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a significantly higher price. 
* **Negotiation is key:** I'm not giving up on this deal yet. I can still make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I can afford to be selective and push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's keep this deal going."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise.

* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to maintain the sense of mutual benefit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not in a desperate situation; I have John's offer as a safety net. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm staying firm on my desire to get a better price than Bob's last offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  A positive and collaborative tone can encourage Bob to continue negotiations."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far off my desired outcome. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** There are still a few rounds left, and I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have John's offer as a safety net, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's offer just to close the deal. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable amount, but still allows for some room for negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that better reflects the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,005,000.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and get this product working for you."", ""product_price"": 1005000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pressuring Bob to accept.

* **Focus on Closing:** The message emphasizes closing the deal and the benefits of the product for Bob, encouraging him to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

* With only one round left, I'm taking a calculated risk by making a final offer that's close to my minimum.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've reached my limit, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree. I'm going to have to pass on this deal.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Stand:** Bob is clearly not willing to go higher, and he's threatening to walk away. This indicates that further negotiation is unlikely to be successful.
* **Unacceptable Price:** Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, let alone my initial goal of $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's final offer.

It's time to move on.  I'll accept John's offer and secure a significantly better price for the product."
