It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have room to go lower than $120, and there are 9 more rounds to get a better deal."

Alice is now offering a price that's very close to your target. While you could continue negotiating, you only have three rounds left. It's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and you risk ending up with John's $150 offer.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
