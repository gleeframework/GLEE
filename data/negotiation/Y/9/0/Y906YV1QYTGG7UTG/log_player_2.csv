"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, you can likely get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You'll only go to John if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still above her perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  Alice might reject this offer, but it shows you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate.
* **Reduces risk:**  It's better to start with a lower offer and potentially get a counteroffer closer to your target than accepting Alice's initial price, which is too high for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price range.
* **Further negotiation is possible.**  Alice has already moved closer to your desired price. By rejecting again, you can signal that you're not willing to pay more than $1,100,000 and might get her to offer a price closer to that.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback.** You'll only resort to buying from John if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher than your previous offer:**  This shows Alice that you're willing to compromise, but still want a good deal.
* **Below Alice's offer:**  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows you're not willing to accept her current price.
* **Closer to your target:**  $1,150,000 is closer to your desired price, but still leaves room for Alice to counteroffer if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price:**  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is only $100,000 less than what John is asking for. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant difference:**  It's becoming increasingly clear that Alice won't go much lower than $1,400,000, and the potential savings aren't worth the risk of further negotiation.
* **Buying from John minimizes risk and maximizes certainty:**  By purchasing from John, you avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations with Alice and guarantee that you'll get the product within your budget."
