"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This would still give you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal closer to this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,080,000? It's a bit closer to my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make sure you're getting a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,080,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference one more time - how about $1,065,000? I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.",1065000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to split the difference again. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,090,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle to get the deal done.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  How about $1,075,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway one last time, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,095,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to compromise further. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1095000.0,Alice,9,
