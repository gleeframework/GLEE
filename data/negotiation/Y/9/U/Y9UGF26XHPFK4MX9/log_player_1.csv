Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000.  This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we want to get as close to that as possible without pushing him away. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,300,000 sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be from a favorable position for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.
* **""One-Time Offer"":** This creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and favorably."
