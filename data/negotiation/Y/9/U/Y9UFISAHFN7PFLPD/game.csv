"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to consider a price of $14000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13500. I'm willing to consider a price of $14500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer. I believe the product's value justifies this price. What are your thoughts?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll consider a price of $14000, which is $200 above your last offer. This is my final concession. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
