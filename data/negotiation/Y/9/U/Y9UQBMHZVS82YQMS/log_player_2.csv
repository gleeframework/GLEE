{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's offering $13,000, which is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. This aggressive counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below his maximum budget.

By offering $14,000, Bob is trying to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget and higher than his last offer.  It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slightly increasing his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  This offer is a little higher than his previous one, but still below his maximum budget. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is not willing to overpay.  He's trying to find a meeting point within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $19,500 is still too high for Bob, even though it's slightly lower than her previous offer. With only a few rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't moving quickly enough for Bob to feel confident that he can get a significantly better price. It's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $15,000, which is within his budget and provides a guarantee of purchase.  There's no guarantee that he'll get a lower price from Alice in the remaining rounds, and it's not worth risking missing out on the product entirely."
