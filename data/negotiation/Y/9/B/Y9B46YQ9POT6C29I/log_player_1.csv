Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from selling to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that gives you a significant share of the potential profit while still ensuring Bob sees enough value to accept.  Going too high risks losing the deal to John.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000, reflecting its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive, highlights the product's value to Bob, and builds confidence.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 gives you $150,000 above your minimum and leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his alternative. This split leans in your favor while still making the deal attractive to Bob.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,000,000 from John) will help you negotiate effectively.
* **Relationship:**  While maximizing profit is important, consider the long-term implications. If you want to maintain a good relationship with Bob, leaving some value on the table for him might be beneficial."
