"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  My message is positive and encouraging to create a good impression and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the value the product holds for Bob to incentivize him to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **Protecting My Interest:**  Selling to John at this point would secure a guaranteed $1,500,000. However, I want to explore the potential for a better deal with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a Strong Stance:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm open to negotiation by offering a counteroffer.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price but only by a reasonable amount, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize finding a solution that benefits both of us to encourage Bob to cooperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal outcome.
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe I can push Bob a little further with another counteroffer.  
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:**  Selling to John would guarantee $1,500,000, but I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of a better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,050,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing that I'm getting closer to my minimum price but not willing to give in completely.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's far below my minimum.  I want to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate that. But $1,025,000 is just not feasible for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are getting to the later rounds, and I need to be assertive while still being open to negotiation.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one, showing a strong willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal now, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept and avoid risking a potential deal falling apart.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm reiterating the fairness of the offer, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to meet you halfway. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,037,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are down to our last two rounds, and the negotiation is getting increasingly difficult.
* **Not a Significant Increase:** Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous offer, and it's still a considerable distance from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteeing Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is a significant amount and meets my minimum requirement.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a high risk that we won't reach a deal within the remaining round.  

Given the time pressure, the lack of significant improvement in Bob's offer, and the guaranteed profit from selling to John, it's the most logical decision to sell to John and secure my desired profit."
