Round 2

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. That's still a great deal for you and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
