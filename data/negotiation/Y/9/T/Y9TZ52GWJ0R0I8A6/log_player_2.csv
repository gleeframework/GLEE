"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in purchasing it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$110 is still a good deal compared to John's price, and it's closer to your desired price point.  It's worth accepting to save the time and effort of further negotiation."
