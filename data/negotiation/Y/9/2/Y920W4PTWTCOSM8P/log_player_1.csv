Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $13,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have room to negotiate a higher price without risking losing the sale completely. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
