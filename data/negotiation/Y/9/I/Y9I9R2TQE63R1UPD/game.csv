"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,
