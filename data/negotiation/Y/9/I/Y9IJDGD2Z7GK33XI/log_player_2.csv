{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer from Alice is way over my budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  This price is still within my budget, but it's a significant discount."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly above my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm raising my offer again, getting closer to Alice's price but still below my absolute limit. I'm hoping this counteroffer is compelling enough for Alice to accept, avoiding the need to buy from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is close, but I'm not willing to risk going further. I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and I'm within $5 of my desired price with John. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
