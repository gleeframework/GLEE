Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still highly profitable for you.
* **Consider Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John. Offering it to Bob at $11,000 gives you a good chance of a higher profit without risking the sale entirely."
