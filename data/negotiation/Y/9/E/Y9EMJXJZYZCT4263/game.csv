"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer given the product's worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, which is $15,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and my minimum selling price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,5,
