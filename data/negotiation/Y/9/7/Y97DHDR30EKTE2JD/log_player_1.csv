"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8500? It's still a good price for you, and a good deal for me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The goal is to maximize profit, and while Bob's offer is better than John's, I can likely get closer to my desired price range of $9,500.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great deal, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $9000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8800, which is still a good deal for you. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and we can close this deal. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, Bob's offer of $8,800 is a good compromise. It's still a substantial profit for me and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product."
