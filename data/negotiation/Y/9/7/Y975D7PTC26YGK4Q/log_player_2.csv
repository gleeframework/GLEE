"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You can do better by rejecting this offer."
