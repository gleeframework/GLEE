I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the value of the product to me. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."

While $775,000 is closer to what I want, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair. I'm going to try and push for a higher price."

Bob's offer of $810,000 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. While it's less than what I'd like, it's a good deal considering the back and forth negotiation."
