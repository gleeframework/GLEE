"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to make some concessions to make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I've placed on it and the value you've placed on it as well.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've placed on it. I hope you'll consider this offer seriously.
