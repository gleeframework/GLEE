"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to make some concessions to make it happen.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I've placed on it and the value you've placed on it as well.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective valuations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've placed on it. I hope you'll consider this offer seriously.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
