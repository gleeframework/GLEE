"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value of this unique product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better middle ground. I'd like to offer $1,900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
