"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now below Bob's maximum budget.**  While Bob wants to save as much as possible, he's already stated his willingness to pay $1,300,000. Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is within that range.
* **Alice is stating this is her final offer.**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects it, he'll either need to pay John's higher price or risk losing the opportunity altogether. 
* **It's a good deal compared to John.** Bob can secure the product for $75,000 less than John's price. 

By accepting the offer, Bob saves money and acquires the product."
