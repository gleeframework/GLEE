"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a bit further. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,,
