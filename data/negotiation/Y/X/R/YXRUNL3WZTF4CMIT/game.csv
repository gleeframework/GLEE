"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to $14,000. How about we meet at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  While I'm willing to negotiate further, I can't go above $12,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,,
