"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $25000. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further!",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something we can work with?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a complimentary service that's valued at $2000. This way, you'll get the product for $16000, plus the extra service. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. However, I'm willing to throw in another extra service, valued at $1000, on top of the one I offered earlier. This way, you'll get the product for $15000, plus the two services, totaling $3000 in value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,

This way, you'll get the product for $14500, plus the three services, totaling $4500 in value. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you.
