Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to sell it for $115. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

To maximize your profit, you need to offer a price that is attractive to Bob (higher than your minimum and John's offer) but also allows you to capture some of the value. 

Offering $115 gives Bob a small discount, encouraging him to buy, while still netting you a $15 profit over your next best option."
