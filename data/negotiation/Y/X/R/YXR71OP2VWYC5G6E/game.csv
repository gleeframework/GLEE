"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being open to negotiation but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you, given the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $10,750. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and represents a fair value for the product based on its worth to you. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to make it work.",10500.0,Bob,6,
