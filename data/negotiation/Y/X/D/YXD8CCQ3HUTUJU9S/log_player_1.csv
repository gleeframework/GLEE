Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great [product name] that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering the product at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep Bob interested and open to negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** By ending the message with ""Let me know what you think!"", I leave the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to proceed further. 

Remember, this is just a starting point.  How I adjust my strategy will depend on Bob's response and the overall negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $150.  

Here's why I'm rejecting Bob's offer:

* **Negotiation is Key:**  Negotiation is about finding a middle ground that benefits both parties.  Immediately accepting Bob's offer would give away my bargaining power.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's interest in the product suggests he may be willing to pay more than $100. By rejecting his offer and counteroffering, I can explore that possibility. 
* **Flexibility with John:** Having the option to sell to John for $100 gives me a safety net.  If the negotiations with Bob stall, I can still secure a decent sale.

In the next round, I'll carefully consider a counteroffer that balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial price points. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, keeping the conversation open and amicable.
* **Clear Offer:**  I've stated the new price clearly and concisely, avoiding any ambiguity. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm asking Bob for his input, keeping the negotiation going and signaling my openness to further discussion. 

This counteroffer positions me to potentially secure a good price for the product while remaining receptive to Bob's final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low for me to consider.  

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my counteroffers, potentially leading to a worse outcome.
* **Time is Money:** Engaging in further rounds of negotiation would consume valuable time and effort.  Selling to John allows me to secure a sale quickly and efficiently.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The potential for a higher price with Bob is not worth the risk of losing the sale entirely. By accepting John's offer, I'm ensuring a certain profit and avoiding potential delays.

While I'd ideally prefer to sell the product for closer to my original asking price, selling to John is the most sensible decision in this scenario. It allows me to maximize my profit and minimize the risk of losing the sale altogether."
