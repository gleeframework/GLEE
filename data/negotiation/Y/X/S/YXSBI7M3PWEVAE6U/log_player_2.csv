"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that's extremely valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. My price for the product is $999,000. This is a very fair offer considering the product's value to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is only $1,000 less than John's price, it's still a saving.  As Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
