Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still not meeting my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, but this is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.  Let's finalize this deal and get this product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to accept as it's closer to your budget, you have a good chance of getting a lower price with a counteroffer.  Remember, you have John as an alternative, and you can still save more money by negotiating with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's close this deal at $1,315,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  It's a small adjustment from your last offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice is firm on her price, and you risk losing the deal completely. At $1,315,000, you're still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's offer, and you can secure the product without the risk of further negotiation."
