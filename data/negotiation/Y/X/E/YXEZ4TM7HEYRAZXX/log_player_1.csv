Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us a chance to settle on a price that's still profitable for me. I'm keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John, so I don't need to accept any offer that's below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell at $120, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $140. This is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us. It's a compromise that demonstrates flexibility while keeping the price above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for $140, Bob has come up from his initial offer and is now within my minimum acceptable price range. Selling for $130 is better than selling to John for $150, and it's better than continuing the negotiation and potentially reaching a stalemate or a lower price."
