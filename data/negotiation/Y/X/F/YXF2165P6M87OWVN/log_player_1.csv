Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very eager. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum value ($100) might seem too opportunistic and discourage him. A price slightly below your guaranteed sale shows you're aiming for a fair deal."
