"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,150,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I can't accept a price that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
