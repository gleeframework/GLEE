"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product is worth $1500000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true worth while allowing me to achieve my financial goals. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1400000. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between the value you see in the product and the return I seek. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,400,000, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation ($1,200,000), it's still lower than what you're willing to pay ($1,500,000). 

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $100,000 compared to buying from John."
