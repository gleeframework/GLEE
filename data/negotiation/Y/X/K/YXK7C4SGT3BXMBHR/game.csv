"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $13,500? That gives you a good price, while still allowing me to get a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for your product. This is still within my budget and offers a reasonable saving compared to your initial offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
