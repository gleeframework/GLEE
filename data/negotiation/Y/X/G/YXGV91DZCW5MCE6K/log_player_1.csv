"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves some room for negotiation, as the product is worth $150 to Bob, but it's still above my minimum value of $120.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a small compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for further negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly below my desired price and significantly better than selling to John.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
