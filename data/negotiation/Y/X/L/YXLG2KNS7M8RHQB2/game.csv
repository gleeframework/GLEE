"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product has a lot of value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down significantly? Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging my budget constraints.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but $725,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and the market conditions, while also showing my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely still interested. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a strong offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad to hear that you're still interested, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price reflects the value of the product and my target, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,7,
