Round 3

# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. What do you think?

It's time to switch to John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and you're running out of rounds. You're better off securing the deal with John at your target price."
