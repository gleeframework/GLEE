Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more inclined to consider my offer. 
* **Reasoning for Value:** I've included a reason why the product is valuable, even though it's a simple statement. This helps to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I hope to push Bob towards making a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to assess his interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired range. I'm also keeping my backup option with John in mind, giving me the ability to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's better than nothing, accepting it would mean a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. I'll use the information from this round to strategize my next move, keeping in mind that I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Reasoning:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great deal"" he's getting.

**Strategy:**

By offering $125, I'm hoping to find a middle ground and secure a price that is more favorable to me than Bob's initial offer while still being appealing to him. This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. I'll continue to monitor the situation and be ready to either accept a counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $110 for the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a few more rounds of negotiation might push Bob closer to my ideal price, it's not a guarantee. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a safe and acceptable profit, minimizing risk.

**Strategy:**

I've been willing to negotiate, but Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. At this point, the potential for a successful negotiation is becoming less likely.  It's more beneficial to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
