,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value beyond the market average. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,220,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
