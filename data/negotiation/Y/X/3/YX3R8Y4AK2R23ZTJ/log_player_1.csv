{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $150 to leave some room for negotiation.  I think $175 is a fair starting point, given the value of the product to me and its potential value to Bob. I'll be prepared to negotiate if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to get $150 now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing, or having to sell to John for the same price."
