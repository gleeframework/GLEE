"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Can you consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $13500. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
