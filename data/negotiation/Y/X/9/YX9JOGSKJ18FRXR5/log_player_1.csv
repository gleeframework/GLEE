"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's more than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay at least this much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm not willing to settle for $95 yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's more than Bob's last offer but less than my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe I can push for a higher price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $100. This shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but I still need to make a profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's tempting to take it and avoid further negotiation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. I've lowered my price again to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go below $95 at this point. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $80.  

While Bob's offer of $80 matches my minimum acceptable price, I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with him isn't likely to get me a better deal.  He seems unwilling to budge much further, and I don't want to risk further negotiation rounds resulting in a lower offer or a failed deal. 

Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can find other buyers in the future who are willing to pay more."
