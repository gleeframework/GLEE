"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.** You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a good deal for you.
* **Rejecting the offer means paying more.**  If you reject, you'll have to buy from John for $100, which is more expensive."
