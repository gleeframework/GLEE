"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your budget, I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  I believe we can find a resolution at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
