"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 - $100,000 = $1,100,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,100,000. It shows you recognize the value of this product. However,  $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of what's being offered.  Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? This would represent a significant but fair discount on my initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $1,600,000, and you're now offering $1,350,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,350,000 - $150,000 = $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer $1,200,000 - $50,000 = $1,150,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
