{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal through negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,150,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm happy to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as my final offer. This would allow us both to get a fair price. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering his final price, which is still within his budget.  He's trying to push Alice towards a decision point, recognizing that if she rejects, he may have to go with John's offer.  He also reinforces the idea that this is a fair deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $1120000. This is my final offer.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,120,000 is still above Bob's target price.  At this point, Bob has exhausted his negotiation options with Alice and can secure a better deal by purchasing the product from John for $1,000,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when a guaranteed lower price is available."
