Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,300,000, you anchor the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects, his counteroffers might be closer to your target price than if you started lower.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. You can be more assertive in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Based on my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant jump from his initial valuation of $800,000, indicating a strong interest in the product. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. By rejecting and countering, I aim to negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob since I have the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  This product has significant long-term value that I'm confident justifies a higher price.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've come down from my initial offer ($1,300,000) while still remaining significantly above Bob's offer ($950,000). This signals a willingness to negotiate but maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (long-term value) helps Bob understand my perspective.
* **Pressure and Alternative:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, Bob is likely aware of other potential buyers. My willingness to walk away if necessary strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, considering my financial constraints and the market conditions, I am unable to meet your latest proposal. I would like to offer $1,000,000 as a final counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. There's no strategic advantage to pushing further or risking the deal by continuing negotiations. Accepting Bob's offer secures a successful sale at my desired price."
