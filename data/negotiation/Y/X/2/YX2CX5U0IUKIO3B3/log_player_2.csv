"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for just $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's product is worth $15,000 to you, she's selling it for $12,000. This is a significant savings compared to John's price of $15,000.
* **It's still within your budget.** You're willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is well below that. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
