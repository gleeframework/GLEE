"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $12000 is a bit lower than I'd like to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. This still allows you to save money compared to my original offer and is closer to my own valuation. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $12800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the price you're willing to meet me at. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",12800.0,Bob,4,
