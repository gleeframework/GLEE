Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.

This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still within a reasonable range considering the product's potential.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
