Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it can be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, which is a fair starting point considering its potential.  What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  While I understand your budget, this product's unique value makes a slightly higher price necessary.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still within a reasonable range considering the product's potential.  Let's find common ground.
