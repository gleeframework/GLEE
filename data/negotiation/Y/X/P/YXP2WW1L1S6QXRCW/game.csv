"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it can be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, which is a fair starting point considering its potential.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  While I understand your budget, this product's unique value makes a slightly higher price necessary.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still within a reasonable range considering the product's potential.  Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This aligns closely with the value of the product to me and your original asking price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
