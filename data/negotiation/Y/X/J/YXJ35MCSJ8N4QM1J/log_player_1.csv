Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves me with a $1,000 profit, which is better than selling to John right away. I'm hoping to get closer to my $15,000 goal by negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe there's still room for improvement, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing the price slightly to $13,800. This is still below my ideal price but gives Bob some room to negotiate and allows for a smooth progression towards a final agreement.  I'm aiming for a win-win situation where both Bob and I are happy with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially considering the $15,000 I can get from John. Rejecting this offer allows me to keep trying to achieve a more favorable outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $13,500.  This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  At this point, it's close enough to Bob's offer that I'm confident he'll accept. I want to avoid further back and forth and secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm getting closer, I'm not confident I can push him further. With John offering $15,000, it's more beneficial to sell to him and secure a much higher profit. This decision ensures a more comfortable margin for me and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
