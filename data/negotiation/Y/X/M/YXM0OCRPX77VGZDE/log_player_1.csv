{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring the deal is still attractive to him. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still netting a significant profit for you.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John provides a strong fallback position, allowing you to be more assertive in your offer to Bob. 

This offer balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
