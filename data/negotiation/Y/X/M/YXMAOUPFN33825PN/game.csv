"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still below my target. I'm willing to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. I'm thinking of $1150000. This is my best and final offer, but I'm willing to consider it for you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to be aggressive, but $1150000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think I can only go up to $1000000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1250000. This is my last offer, and I hope you can see the value in it.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
