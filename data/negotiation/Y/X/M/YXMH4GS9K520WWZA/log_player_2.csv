"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $140 for it. This offer takes into account both the value the product holds for you and my goal to maximize the earnings from this sale. I believe this price is fair for both parties and allows me to achieve my financial objective while providing you with an excellent deal. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit high. While she tries to position it as a good deal, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price, getting you closer to your $150 maximum budget."
