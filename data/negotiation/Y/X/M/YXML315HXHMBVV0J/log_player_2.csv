# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?
