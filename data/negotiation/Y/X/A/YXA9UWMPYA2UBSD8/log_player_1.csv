Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum value, I have 10 rounds and the potential for a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we meet at $1,150,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still 50,000 below my minimum acceptable price. I have more rounds and can try to get closer to my desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $1,150,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Let's split the difference and go with $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.  It's a deal that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your ideal price, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,200,000, which is $1,175,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,175,000 is a reasonable offer, it's still below my minimum value. With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of getting Bob to go higher is slim. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
