"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we meet at $1,150,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $1,150,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Let's split the difference and go with $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.  It's a deal that benefits both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your ideal price, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,200,000, which is $1,175,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
