"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $90?  It's a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm happy to go to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my original price.",110.0,Alice,5,
