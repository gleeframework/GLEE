"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $150 to her, so she must be making a profit of $20. If I buy it from her for $130, she'll still make a profit of $20. If I reject her offer, I can buy it from John for $80, saving $50.
