"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
