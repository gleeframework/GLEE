"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Would you be open to considering that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $12000.  This price still reflects the product's value, but it allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know if you'd like to continue discussing this further.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
