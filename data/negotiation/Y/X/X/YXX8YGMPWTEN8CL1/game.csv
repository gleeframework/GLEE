,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay that much more than its value to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This still represents a significant value to you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  What's your decision?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $862,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you place on it.",862500.0,Bob,6,
