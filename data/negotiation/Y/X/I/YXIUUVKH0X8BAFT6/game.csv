"I understand you're looking to stay within a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm afraid the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1025000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1025000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
