"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to continue trying to drive the price down.  You can also potentially use this as a bargaining chip to push for a price closer to $11,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $11,500 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $11500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to come down further, and continuing to negotiate will likely result in a stalemate.  It's more beneficial to accept the guaranteed price of $10,000 from John."
