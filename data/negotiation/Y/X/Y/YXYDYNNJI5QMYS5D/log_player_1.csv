Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I make a profit above my minimum of $120.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this offer is fair and will be accepted by Bob."
