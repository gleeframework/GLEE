"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $100 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice!  That's a nice product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value. This gives us room to negotiate while signaling we're serious buyers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  Let's try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $85 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving and offers a price that's a decent deal for both of us."
