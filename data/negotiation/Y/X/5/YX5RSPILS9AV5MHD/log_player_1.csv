Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit while also being open to negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to move up to $900,000 to find that middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my goal, $900,000 is still too low.  I'm not in a rush to sell and John is a reliable option. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still not a feasible price for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This price would allow us both to walk away happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
