"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to move up to $900,000 to find that middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still not a feasible price for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This price would allow us both to walk away happy with the transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
