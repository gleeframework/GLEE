"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm looking for a price of $14,000 to make this a win-win. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to counteroffer and try to get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  It's good to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but it's not the best deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and quickly pay for itself. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While closer to your budget, $13,250 is still more than what you're comfortable paying. 
* **More negotiation room:** You have several rounds left, and there's still room to bargain further.  
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** You can still get the product from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,250 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $13,000 - that would be a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
