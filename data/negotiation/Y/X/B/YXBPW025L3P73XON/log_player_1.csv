"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know Bob values the product lower than my minimum, I want to begin with a strong anchor price. This leaves room for negotiation while emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the product's value and the potential for a ""win-win"" situation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm aware this initial price is likely to be countered, but it sets a higher baseline for the negotiation.

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and leave space for strategic concessions in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far beyond what I'm able to pay.  Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is expected. Accepting would mean a significant loss. While I have a guaranteed offer from John, there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls significantly short of the product's true value and my minimum selling price. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** This counteroffer is my absolute minimum, matching John's offer. It's important to stand firm on this value.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob ""halfway"" between the initial offers.
* **Creating Urgency:** By putting my minimum on the table, I'm signaling to Bob that there's limited room for further significant price reductions.

This strategy aims to secure a sale at my desired price while keeping the negotiation door open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original counteroffer of $800,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is anchored to his valuation and unwilling to budge.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a better result. I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired minimum, making it the most logical choice.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
