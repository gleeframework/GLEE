,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $1,900,000, which would be $1,850,000. Can you consider this offer?",1850000.0,Bob,4,
