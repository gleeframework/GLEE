"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product holds value, but the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. This product has the potential to generate substantial value, and I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price that reflects that potential. Let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value proposition, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $975,000 makes the most sense. This price significantly surpasses my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and gives me a healthy profit. It's always better to secure a good deal than risk losing it entirely by pushing too hard in negotiations."
