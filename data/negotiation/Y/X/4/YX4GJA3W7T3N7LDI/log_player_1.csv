Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential $400,000 difference between what Bob values the product at and your minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $400,000 as possible without alienating Bob and making him reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire an asset that can significantly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $1,100,000 sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, making the high price seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, you leave some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you well above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a less aggressive starting price."
