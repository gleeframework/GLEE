"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows that you're confident in the value of your product.

Remember, I'm here to help you maximize your earnings. I'll be analyzing Bob's responses and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid selling to John at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to settle for a price this low yet.  

I'll use the next round to counter-offer with a price closer to my ideal value, while still being open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  A $100,000 decrease from my initial offer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Highlight the finality:**  Stating this is my ""final offer"" adds pressure and encourages Bob to seriously consider accepting.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate. This message reinforces that I have other options (like selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a win-win solution.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I have a few rounds left and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue pushing for a higher price.  I'll aim for a price that's closer to $950,000, but I'm prepared to make a concession if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go lower than $925,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small decrease to show I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm keeping the price closer to my ideal.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my offer is fair.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's finalize this deal"" subtly pressures Bob to accept, showcasing that I'm moving towards a closing point. 

By now, I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for my ideal price and potentially losing the deal with Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not ready to settle.  I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  

Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer one last time, potentially securing a price closer to $925,000.  However, I'll need to be prepared to make a final concession if necessary, as selling to John remains a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $915,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing my commitment to reaching a deal. 
* **Finality:** I'm stating this is a ""final"" offer to push Bob towards accepting.
* **Win-Win Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob that this deal benefits both parties. 

With only a few rounds left, it's crucial to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and securing a deal before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $915,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $912,500, which is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at the end of the negotiation process, and it's unlikely that Bob will offer more than $912,500.  Accepting his offer is the best option considering the following:

* **Close to my target:** $912,500 is only $2,500 below my last counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer and Bob refuses to go higher, I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer of $1,200,000 is much more appealing, I'm risking a significant loss of potential profit by waiting until the last round.  

It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risks involved.  In this scenario, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision."
