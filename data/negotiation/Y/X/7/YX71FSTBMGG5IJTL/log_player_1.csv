"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident it's worth more to Bob than the $10,000 he's willing to pay, and I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell it for $10,000. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  However, I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his. I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a decent price and not driving him away.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  This is my absolute top offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000, but it's getting closer. I'm going to counter with a price closer to his offer, but not quite there yet.  I'm hoping to get a deal done in the next few rounds, but I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $12,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd get a great product at a fair price, and I'd be closer to my target.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a price halfway between his latest offer and my previous one. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully convincing him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum, but we're getting closer. I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting worried about running out of time. If Bob doesn't come up to my price, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a solution. While $11,500 is closer, it's still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a compromise for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's latest offer and my previous one.  I'm emphasizing this is my final offer before considering John as a buyer. This creates pressure on Bob and shows I'm serious about getting a deal done, but I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If you don't accept this offer, I'm afraid I'll have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. We only have two rounds left, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.  I'm going to try one last counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to budge, but if he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time and I want to make sure we can reach a deal. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 one last time. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob the same price I offered in round 7, but emphasize that this is my final offer and I'm prepared to walk away.  This is my last chance to get a better deal from Bob before I sell to John.  I'm hoping this creates some urgency and convinces him to accept."
