"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to establish a high baseline and see if Bob is serious about buying. I'm confident in the value of the product and am aiming for the best possible price.  If he rejects, we can adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I have 9 more rounds and don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm feeling the pressure, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm still confident in the product's value and will try to secure a better price. I'm also aware of the time constraint and will need to act strategically. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his last offer, hopefully bridging the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum threshold. I'm trying to find a middle ground and hopefully convince Bob to close the deal.  We're getting close to the halfway point, and I need to strike a balance between securing a good price and avoiding the risk of losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than what John is offering. I'm going to counter with a price closer to his last offer, but still above $800,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, the stakes are getting higher, but I need to be strategic and try to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $800,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and the same amount John is offering.  With only three rounds left, I need to make a decisive move. If Bob rejects this, I'll be forced to accept John's offer to avoid losing any profit at all. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident he'll budge.  I don't want to risk losing any money at all.  I'll take John's offer of $800,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiation."
