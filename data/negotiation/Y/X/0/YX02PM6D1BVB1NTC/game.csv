"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of my product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
