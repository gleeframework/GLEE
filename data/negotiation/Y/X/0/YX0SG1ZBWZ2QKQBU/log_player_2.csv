"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.** This is still below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiating further might save a few hundred dollars, but it's not worth the risk.** There's a chance Alice will reject Bob's counteroffer and the price might go up. 
* **Buying from John for $15,000 would be more expensive.** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer for $11,000 is the best choice for Bob to maximize his savings while still getting the product."
