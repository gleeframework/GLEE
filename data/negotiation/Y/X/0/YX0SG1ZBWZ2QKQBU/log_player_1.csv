Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
