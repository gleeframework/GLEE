"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its benefits.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial deal, $9,000 is still too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price ($12,000) which she stated was important to her. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to take that deal."
