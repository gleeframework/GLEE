"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $700,000 for it to make sense for me.  What can you do?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the  value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still pretty far apart.  That price needs to come down significantly for me to consider it.  I can do $800,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but  $800,000 is far below what I can accept. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value while recognizing your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
