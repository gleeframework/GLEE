"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  This price still allows for a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price allows for a good profit for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your need to get a good price, and I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to make a profit. This is the best I can do, so let's close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
