Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages a response. It also emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price, which might make Bob more likely to consider it.

**Strategy:**

This approach balances the following:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting high allows for potential profit beyond my minimum value.
* **Avoiding Rejection:**  The price is within the realm of possibility for Bob, making rejection less likely.
* **Keeping Options Open:** By leaving room for negotiation, I can adjust if Bob makes a counteroffer, or if I need to sweeten the deal to close the deal quickly.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum price gives me the confidence to walk away from a negotiation if it becomes too unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's a decent profit for Bob, it's far below my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, I can counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a safety net.**  If negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

**Next steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  This price still allows for a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've increased the price from Bob's offer, but still offered a significant reduction from my original offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I've given a clear reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing that it's still profitable for Bob. This makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Call to Action:** The message encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find middle ground:**  The price is closer to my desired range while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not giving in completely, showing I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Keep John in mind:**  I can still walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't come up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

* **John is a strong safety net.**  If the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable, I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price allows for a good profit for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** I've explained the price is a compromise that benefits both of us, highlighting the ""fairness"" of the offer.
* **Call to Action:**  I've emphasized the need to close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

* **Maintain leverage:**  I haven't given in completely, showing that I still have leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Balance profit with urgency:** I'm aiming for a profitable deal but also want to avoid a protracted negotiation, which could lead to John taking the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your need to get a good price, and I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to make a profit. This is the best I can do, so let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** Although it's a good profit for Bob,  $910,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **The negotiation is stalling.**  We've been going back and forth, and it seems unlikely that Bob will go any higher. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale.**  Selling to John will secure me my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This decision is based on the following:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum price, securing a much higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and might not lead to a better offer. 
* **John's reliability:**  I'm confident that John will complete the purchase, ensuring a smooth and secure transaction.

While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my desired price,  selling to John is the most profitable and efficient choice at this point."
