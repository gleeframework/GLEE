It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,000,000 from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  This price still allows for a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's meet in the middle.

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:

This price allows for a good profit for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal.

While $925,000 is a good deal and getting closer to your target, it's still slightly above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate one more time and see if you can get Alice to come down just a bit more."
