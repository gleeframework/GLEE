I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This price is a good starting point because it's below Bob's estimated value of $15,000, giving him an incentive to buy. It also leaves room for potential negotiation if he counters with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
