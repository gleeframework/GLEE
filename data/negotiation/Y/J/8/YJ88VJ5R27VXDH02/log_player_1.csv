Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can confidently start high. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""potential"" and ""benefits"" subtly emphasizes its value, making the higher price more palatable.
* **Round Number:** Using a round number like $2,000,000 can make the offer seem more deliberate and less arbitrary.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. We expect some back and forth with Bob. If he outright rejects the initial price, we have the security of John's offer, allowing us to negotiate from a position of strength."
