"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it.  While I think the product is great, I'm not sure I can go that high. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I think that's fair to both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
