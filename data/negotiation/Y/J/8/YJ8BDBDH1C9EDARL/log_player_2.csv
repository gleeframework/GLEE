"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can get the product from John for $10,000, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer of $12,000."
