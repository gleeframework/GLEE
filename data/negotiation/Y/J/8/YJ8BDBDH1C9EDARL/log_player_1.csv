Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a compromise price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than the value I'd get from selling to John. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **The message:** This emphasizes the value Bob would get and makes the offer appealing. 

By offering this price, I have a chance to get a higher price than John's offer while still securing a sale if Bob rejects it."
