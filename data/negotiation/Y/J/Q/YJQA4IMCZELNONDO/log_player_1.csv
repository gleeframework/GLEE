Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident the product is valuable, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but still closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable amount, and it's higher than what John is offering.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing Bob and ending up with less money."
