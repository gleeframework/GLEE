"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I think it's a fair deal. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think you'll be thrilled with the opportunity to own it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you want to save as much as possible, $900,000 is still significantly less than $1,500,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and you're getting it for $100,000 more. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $600,000 compared to buying from John."
