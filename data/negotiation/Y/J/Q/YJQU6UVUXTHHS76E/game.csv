"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the discount you're offering. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the significant discount I'm already offering, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value of the product and the discount you're offering. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a little too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to go down to $1,025,000. This price reflects the product's true value and offers you a significant discount.  I'm confident this is a fair offer that will allow us both to walk away happy.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and the discount you're offering. Let me know what you think!",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $975,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to offer a final compromise:  $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still offer you a significant discount.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I will have to look elsewhere for a buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
