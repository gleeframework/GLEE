Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $20,000 is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potentially profitable deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Showing flexibility demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob helps pique his interest and makes him more likely to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob counters, I'll assess his offer and either accept (if it's close to my desired price) or counter with a price closer to $20,000.
* **John as a backup:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $15,000, and Bob's offer is at that minimum.  There's potential for a better deal.
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** I can try to increase the price slightly.  Bob seems interested, so a counteroffer might be successful.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is secure, I don't want to miss out on the possibility of making a slightly higher profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a slightly higher price, perhaps $17,000,  explaining that I value the product highly and am willing to negotiate.
* **Observe Bob's reaction:** I'll see if Bob is willing to compromise,  and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a great deal.  While I value this product highly and wouldn't accept anything less than $15,000, I'm open to a small compromise. How about $17,000? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm willing to move slightly from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit.
* **Fair price:**  I emphasize that $17,000 is a fair price for both of us, making it seem more appealing than a hard-line stance.
* **Previous offer as reference:**  I remind Bob of my initial offer ($20,000), highlighting that I've already lowered my price significantly.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** Based on Bob's reaction, I'll decide whether to accept his counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or consider John's offer.
* **Negotiation strategy:** If Bob rejects again, I might lower my price slightly, but I'll aim to stay above $15,000 as long as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $16000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a good deal considering the potential risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Bob would budge further. He seems firm on his budget. 
* **John's offer:**  While I'm getting slightly more from Bob,  John's offer is still a safe and secure alternative.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalize the deal:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. 
* **Review the experience:**  I'll reflect on the negotiation process and identify areas for improvement in future sales."
