Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
