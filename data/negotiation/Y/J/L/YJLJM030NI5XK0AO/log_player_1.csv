Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer meets your minimum acceptable price, but you have another buyer (John) willing to pay the same amount.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob when you can secure the desired price immediately with John.  This minimizes risk and guarantees you reach your target."
