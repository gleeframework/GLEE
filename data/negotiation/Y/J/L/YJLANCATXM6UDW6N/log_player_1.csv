Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I believe this counteroffer is fair and could be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same price John is willing to pay.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid further negotiations."
