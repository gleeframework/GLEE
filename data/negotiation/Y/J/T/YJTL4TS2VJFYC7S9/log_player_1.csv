"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, I believe he's likely to negotiate. I have 10 rounds to work with and the option to sell to John for $800,000 if things don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price, as Bob has already shown interest in the product. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

I'm going to counter with $880,000.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm trying to find a price that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $860,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial goal of $880,000. We've had a few rounds of negotiation, and I believe there's still room for compromise.  I want to see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 870000}
```

I'm going to counter with $870,000.  This is a compromise, right in the middle of our last two offers. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement and that we're getting closer to a price we both can live with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $855,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $855,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $855,000.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I was hoping for a bit more, $855,000 is a good price and ensures I get a solid return. It's more than John's offer, and it's a reasonable compromise given where we are in the negotiations."
