"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. It's worth a lot more to you than that, so I think this is a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is a bit high. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so you're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice or going with John."
