# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no reason to pay $180."
