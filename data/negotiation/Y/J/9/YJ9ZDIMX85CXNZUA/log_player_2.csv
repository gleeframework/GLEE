"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation, and it's unlikely this is her best price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite but firm, indicating I'm serious about buying but not at any cost. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $11,000, I'm aiming for a final price somewhere between my initial offer and Alice's asking price, ideally closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, the product's value is quite high for me. Could we settle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice moved down in price, it's not a significant drop. This suggests there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price.
* **Alternative Exists:**  The option to buy from John for $15,000 provides a safety net. It means I'm not pressured to accept a price significantly higher than my target.
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about a lower price, prompting her to potentially make a more appealing counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing $12,000, I'm suggesting a classic negotiation tactic â€“ finding a compromise.  This price point represents a fair split of the difference between her previous offer ($13,000) and my last counteroffer ($11,000). 
* **Knowing Her Value:**  Alice has hinted at the product's value to her. Offering her $12,000 ensures she still makes a profit and might be tempting enough for her to accept. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that each round takes time.  Proposing a strong counteroffer like this increases the chance of a quicker resolution."
