Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, which I know you value greatly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uniqueness, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects it, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have a safety net with John."
