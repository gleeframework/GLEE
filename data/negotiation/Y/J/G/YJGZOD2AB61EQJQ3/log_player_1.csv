"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you some profit. It's also a good starting point for a friendly negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $12,500,  which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't drop below $12,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $11,500 is still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle at $11,200?  That would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $11,200 is still a little lower than I'd like. I believe there's still room for negotiation and am willing to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $11,200 is very close, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,350.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11350}
