Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $12,500,  which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $11,200 is very close, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,350.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough call! Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but that $12,000 safety net from John is looking pretty good right now.  Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:**  $11,350 is a decent price, saving you $1,650 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Rejecting:** We're getting close to my limit, and Alice might not budge much more. 
* **John:**  Buying from John means a guaranteed $1,350 saving, but no chance of getting it even lower.

Given the risk of Alice increasing her price or reaching an impasse, I think the smart move is to take the sure thing.
