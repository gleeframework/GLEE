# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  Alice's offer is too high.  Bob can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I know that you really need this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He knows he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $1,000,000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
