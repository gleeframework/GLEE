"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair given its value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This price would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,875. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,875 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *one more time*.  How about $13,062.50?  This is a very fair price that's closer to your offer, and it's also closer to what I need to make this deal work.  What do you think?",13062.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but $13,062.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise one more time and offer $12,900. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but unfortunately, $12,900 still falls short of what I need for this deal to work.  I'm willing to make one last concession, but it needs to be closer to my desired price.  How about $13,125?  This is a fair price that represents a compromise from both of us. If you're serious about buying my product, this is the final price I can offer.",13125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one last concession, but $13,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'll offer $12,950. This is my absolute best and final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",12950.0,Bob,8,
