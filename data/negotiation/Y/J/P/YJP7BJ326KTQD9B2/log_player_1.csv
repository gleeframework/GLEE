Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000, so I can't go lower than that.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a $200,000 difference where we can negotiate.
* **First offer:**  I'm starting with a high offer ($950,000) to leave room for potential counteroffers and reach a mutually beneficial price.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I'm aiming to secure a good portion of the potential profit. This will also force Bob to think strategically about his counteroffer, if he chooses to make one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's offer is a quick sale, I believe there's still potential to get a better price through negotiation.
* **John is a backup option:**  Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything less.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to reach a compromise. If Bob continues to refuse, I'll consider selling to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer of $950,000 was rejected, so I'm now offering a lower price, but still above my minimum of $800,000.
* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer is closer to Bob's offer of $700,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Testing the waters:**  By offering $850,000, I'm gauging Bob's willingness to come up in his price.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob to get us closer to a deal.  If he rejects it, I'll need to consider how much further I'm willing to compromise before accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 I need.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Bob has shown a reluctance to budge significantly from his initial offer.
* **John is a secure option:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price without further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

It's clear that Bob and I are not close to an agreeable price.  Rather than continue a potentially unproductive negotiation, I'll secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
