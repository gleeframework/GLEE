"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also a great value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can we discuss this further?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't regret.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the price John is offering. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on that price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
