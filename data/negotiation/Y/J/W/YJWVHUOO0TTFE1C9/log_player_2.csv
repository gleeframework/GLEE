"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better price from Alice first. $120 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about buying if the price is right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met my price limit. There's no point in negotiating further or going to John since I won't get a better deal."
