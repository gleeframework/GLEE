"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't afford such a high price. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I'm willing to be a bit flexible, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we settle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll see a return on this investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $13,500 is quite a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. Could we possibly agree on $12,000? This would allow me to make the most of my budget while still acquiring a valuable product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
