"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make it yours for $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to try and get a better price. By rejecting her offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I believe it's worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,200,000.  This is a good deal for me, as I'm still getting a substantial discount compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  It's likely that further negotiation might get the price even lower, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John for a higher price is not worth it. I'm confident this price is fair and within my budget."
