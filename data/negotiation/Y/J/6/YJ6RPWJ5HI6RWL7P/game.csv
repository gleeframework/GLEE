"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone of your stature. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $12500. This is my best and final offer for now.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10500. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to someone like you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
