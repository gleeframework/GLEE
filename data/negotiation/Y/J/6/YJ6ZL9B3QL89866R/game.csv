"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still a bit off on $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $93.75? It's a small step closer to my price, but I'm willing to compromise.",93.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $91.25? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $120.",91.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $91.25 is still a bit low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $92. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",92.0,Alice,7,
