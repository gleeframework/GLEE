"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is above your minimum acceptable value but leaves room for negotiation. It also builds rapport with Bob by suggesting he'll be interested in the product.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I think the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my goal, I'm still not convinced it reflects the product's true value. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still a bit off on $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $93.75? It's a small step closer to my price, but I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 93.75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $91.25? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling at this price.  There are still a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $91.25 is still a bit low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $92. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $91? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer of $91 will still give me a good profit, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
