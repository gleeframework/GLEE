"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the value to me, but $10,500 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise at $9,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product. This is a fair price, given our previous discussions and my financial limitations.  Let's try to close this deal.",9100.0,Bob,6,
