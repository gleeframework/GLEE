Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go below $9,150.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,125 is getting very close to my desired price, but it's still above my budget.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from John for a guaranteed $8,000.  I've already gotten a good deal by negotiating with Alice, and it's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
