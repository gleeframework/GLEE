Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price being that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. I'll offer the product to you for $1,160,000.

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to my price range. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that the negotiation could stall, or Alice could become less flexible. Accepting the $1,160,000 offer secures a significant savings compared to John's price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
