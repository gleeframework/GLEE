"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I finalize an agreement with another interested party.  Given the level of interest, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this product will be highly valuable to your operations, and I want to give you priority access. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price, achieving his goal of saving money."
