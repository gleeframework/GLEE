"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my budget as possible. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider $11,800? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $11,800 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. Would you be willing to go to $12,200? It's a small increase, but it would make a big difference for me.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $11,900? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11900.0,Bob,6,
