"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,3,
