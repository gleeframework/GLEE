"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $815,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's getting very close to his target price of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation may be difficult, and buying from John at $1,200,000 is a less attractive option.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action for Bob at this point."
