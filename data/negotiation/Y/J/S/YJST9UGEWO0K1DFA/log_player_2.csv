"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is a good price, but there's room for improvement.**  You have a target of $1,200,000, so there's potential to save more. 
* **You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate.** There's no need to rush into a deal if you think you can get a better one. 

By rejecting the offer, you can see if Alice is willing to lower her price or if you need to start counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility given your budget. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Alice is. If she's willing to drop below $900,000, it suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, it provides a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price, but there's still room to negotiate.**  You're still above your target of $1,200,000.
* **You have several rounds left.** There's no need to rush into a decision; you can continue to see if you can push Alice lower.

By rejecting the offer, you continue to exert pressure on Alice and signal your willingness to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. 
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:**  By offering a price closer to Alice's, you demonstrate your interest in reaching a deal.
* **Leaving room for a final compromise:**  This counteroffer still allows for potential negotiation, but it's getting closer to a point where accepting it might be more favorable for Alice than continuing the process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  $825,000 is significantly closer to your desired price of $1,200,000 than previous offers.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice becoming less flexible or even walking away from the deal. 
* **Limited time:** You've already used several rounds, and continuing to negotiate might waste valuable time.

While there's always a chance you could get a slightly lower price, accepting this offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
