"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, $500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $300000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price. While I appreciate the gesture, $400000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $350000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs.",350000.0,Bob,4,
