Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum ($120). 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's no pressure to accept anything lower. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while having a safety net in the form of John's offer."
