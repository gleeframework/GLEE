Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, so Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum value:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum of $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I have room to lower the price a bit if necessary without going below my minimum.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a favorable position, leaving room for adjustments based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is more than Bob initially thought it was worth, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a good balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to compromise but not cave in.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to take such a significant loss.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
