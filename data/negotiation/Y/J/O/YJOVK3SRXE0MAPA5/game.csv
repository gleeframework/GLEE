"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a significant value for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my budget. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers both the value of the product and the potential for a quick sale. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
