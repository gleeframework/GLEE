Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of us, starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys the product's value and my belief in its potential to encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting this as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a layer of desirability.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it at my minimum acceptable price."
