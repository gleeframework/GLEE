"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to negotiate a lower price.  It's also important to note that Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000 at any time, so he's not under pressure to accept a price he's not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price in the next round, there's also a chance Alice will reject his counteroffer.  At this point, Bob has already rejected Alice's previous two offers, and there's a risk of the negotiation going on for too long, possibly leading to a point where Alice decides to not sell to him.  It's safer for Bob to take the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and doesn't risk further negotiation."
