"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a significant discount from its true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent negotiation."
