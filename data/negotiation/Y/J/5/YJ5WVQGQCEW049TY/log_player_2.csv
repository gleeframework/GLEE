"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer you a discount of $125, bringing the price down to $11,375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While I could try to haggle another $125 off, it's getting risky. Accepting the $11,375 still gets me a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
