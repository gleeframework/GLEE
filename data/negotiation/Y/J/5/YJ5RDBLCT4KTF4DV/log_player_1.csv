"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point that might entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to earn more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is close to Bob's perceived value, I'm not willing to go that low yet.  I'll reject and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm sticking with $13,000. This is a firm price, considering we've been back and forth.  It's a fair compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation. It's getting harder to reach a deal with Bob, and he's showing a clear unwillingness to go higher. Since John is offering my minimum value, it's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
