"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive, aiming to establish a good rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to potentially make Bob more interested. 

**Strategy:** 

This first offer is meant to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation process. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly in subsequent rounds, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't get a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $130 is better than $100 (John's offer), there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay a decent price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than $130. I want to show flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's first counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 would be a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by lowering my price, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to meet me halfway. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the reason for the slightly higher price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting further discussion and potential agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving while keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value.  I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think $140 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Agreement:** $135 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still a small gap. It's worth continuing to see if I can get Bob to go a little higher.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I can potentially negotiate a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than $135. I'm aiming for a compromise that gets us closer to a deal, but I won't be afraid to walk away if the price isn't acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $138? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly from $140 to $138, showing flexibility. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the compromise aspect, emphasizing that we're both moving towards a middle ground.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, justifying the slightly higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that Bob might find acceptable while still getting a price above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm also trying to keep the negotiation positive and collaborative. If this offer is rejected, I might start to consider John's offer more seriously, but I'll still try to get a better price from Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $138 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $132 is close to my minimum acceptable price, there's still a bit of room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a bit more.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I can potentially get a higher price. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  I'm aware that if I keep rejecting offers, there's a risk Bob might lose interest or decide to walk away.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than $132. I want to keep the negotiation moving forward while aiming for a compromise. However, I'll be ready to sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $135.  That's a fair price considering the quality of this product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is a significant compromise, coming down from my previous $138 offer. 
* **Urgency:**  The message implies urgency, suggesting that I'm ready to close the deal. 
* **Focus on Positive Outcome:**  The message emphasizes the positive outcome of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm making a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob at a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value.  If he rejects this offer, I'm likely to accept John's offer to ensure a sale.  I'm hoping to close the deal before running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is $130, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. There is very little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob's interest entirely.  I've already rejected several of his counteroffers.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are down to the final two rounds, and it's unlikely I can get a better offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

It's better to accept this offer and ensure a sale than risk losing the deal completely. While $130 isn't ideal, it's a much better outcome than selling to John for $100. I'll prioritize securing a deal over trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars."
