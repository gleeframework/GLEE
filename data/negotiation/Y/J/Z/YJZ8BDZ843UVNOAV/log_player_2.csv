The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is asking for $120. I'm not going to accept that.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $70 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $80 to me and $80 to her.  Hopefully, she'll accept."

While $100 is closer to my target price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $75.  It's still below what I'd pay John, but I'm hoping Alice will see it as a good compromise and accept."

```

Alice's offer is still too high for me. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80. It's not the best price, but it's within my budget and I don't want to risk spending even more time trying to negotiate with Alice."
