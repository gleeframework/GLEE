{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value ($1,500,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for potential negotiation without immediately making Bob feel like he's getting a raw deal.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a more equitable solution. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this suggestion aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **John's Value:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still remaining above my minimum. 
* **Value-Based Argument:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm expressing my desire to reach a deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to pay $1,150,000 for your product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While we're getting closer, I believe there's still room for improvement. 
* **John's Guarantee:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm still holding out hope for a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value and potentially closer to the middle ground between our current positions."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $1,150,000 remains below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground.

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm focusing on closing the remaining gap to incentivize Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. In light of your latest proposal, I am willing to consider $1,160,000 as a fair price for your product. I hope this aligns better with your needs.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:**  While Bob's offer of $1,160,000 is getting closer, it's still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** I'm starting to feel like the negotiation is becoming drawn out and unproductive.
* **John's Guaranteed Value:**  I've reached a point where the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential for a higher price. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a much more secure outcome for me.

**Conclusion:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure I receive my minimum acceptable value and avoid the uncertainty and potential for further price concessions in the negotiation with Bob."
