"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer it to you for $8800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.
