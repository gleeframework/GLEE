"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This still reflects a significant discount for you.
