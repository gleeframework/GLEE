Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but unfortunately, $14000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $12000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
