,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiating, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,000 is still above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise that gives us both something we want.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,250.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,750. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a decent deal. Let's close this now, as I am running out of time.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pressed for time, but $8,750 is still a bit below my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9000.0,Alice,7,
