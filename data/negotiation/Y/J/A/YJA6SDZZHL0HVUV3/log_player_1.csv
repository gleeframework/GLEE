Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'm selling. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $150 is a reasonable starting point.  It's not outrageous, but it gives me some leverage.
* **Open-Ended Message:** The message is open-ended and invites Bob to respond. This encourages a conversation rather than a simple ""yes"" or ""no."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to make a sale, selling for such a low price would be a major loss. I need to counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm not going down to $80, but I'm also not sticking to my initial $150. $115 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Message:** My message is positive and friendly, while still maintaining a firm stance on the price.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""split the difference"") to make it seem more logical and less arbitrary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm eager to sell, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's tempting to take the deal, but selling at a loss would be detrimental in the long run.  I'll make another counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired range.  If Bob remains unwilling to budge, I'll move forward with selling to John for the guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final offer. It's a significant compromise from my initial price, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a compromise on my part to make Bob feel like I'm being reasonable.
* **Clear Deadline:** This message implies that this is my final offer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already made significant compromises, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. It's time to cut my losses and move forward with the guaranteed sale to John for $120.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling at a loss."
