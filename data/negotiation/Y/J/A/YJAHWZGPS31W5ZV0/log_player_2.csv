This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Matching Price:** Alice has come down to your target price of $100. 
* **Potential Savings:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you risk losing the deal.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is also $100, so there's no benefit to switching at this point."
