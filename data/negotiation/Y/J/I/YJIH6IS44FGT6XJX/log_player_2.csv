"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000.  I think it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. Could you do $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly better than John's price.  Since Alice has rejected a lower offer, there's a good chance further negotiation won't yield a better price, so accepting this offer is the best strategy to maximize savings."
