"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product and understand its potential value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,

To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still reflects the significant value and opportunity this product presents for your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
