Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.

You have three options:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too significant. It's unlikely Bob will reach a price point that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile."
