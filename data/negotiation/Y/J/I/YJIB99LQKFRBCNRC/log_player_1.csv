Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a high offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and encourages a response, opening the door for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be extremely price-sensitive or easily turned off by high initial offers, you might adjust your strategy. 
* **Market Conditions:**  If this product is in extremely high demand and you believe Bob might have other options, you could consider a slightly lower (but still above $800,000) starting point."
