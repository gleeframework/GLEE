"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but $120 is way over my budget. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I understand that it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a good compromise and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,5,
