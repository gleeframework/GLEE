"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $7,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting and making a counteroffer,  Bob might be able to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while keeping the negotiation going.  It's a starting point, and Bob can adjust his offer based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,000 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $6,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met Bob halfway, and a $1,500 discount from her initial offer is a good deal. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results."
