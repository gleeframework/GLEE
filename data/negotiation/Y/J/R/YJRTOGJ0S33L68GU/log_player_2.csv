"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. By offering $13,000, he is:

* **Lowering the price:**  He's offering a price that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially acceptable to her, as it's above the product's value to her.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** This counteroffer provides Alice with an opportunity to negotiate further, but it also gives Bob a chance to see if Alice is willing to move closer to his preferred price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.  
* **Potential Savings:** Buying at $13,700 saves Bob $1,300 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Rounds:**  There are only 7 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate could lead to more concessions, but it also risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price. 

While Bob could try to push for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer provides a significant saving and secures the product within a reasonable timeframe."
