Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit. I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum value, which isn't ideal.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. It leaves room for further negotiation while demonstrating my willingness to find a solution.  I hope Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my counteroffer and is significantly higher than John's offer.  It's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation, so I'm accepting it."
