"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $22000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $20000. Can you consider this price?",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $20000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $22000. I can offer it to you for $21500. This is my final compromise on the price.",21500.0,Alice,5,
