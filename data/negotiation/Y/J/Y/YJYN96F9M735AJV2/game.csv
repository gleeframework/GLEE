"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's something you've expressed interest in before and I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
