Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer, still leaving me with a good profit margin. It's less likely Bob will counter-offer aggressively at this price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slight discount, avoids potential delays in selling to John."
