"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $1,350,000. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you, considering its immense value to you at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is closer to her value than to yours. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Dear Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, we create room for negotiation and signal that we're aiming for a price closer to our own valuation.
* **Anchoring:** This counter-offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Alice to adjust her expectations downward. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While $1,100,000 is a substantial decrease, it leaves space for us to gradually increase our offer over the remaining rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I am unable to match your proposed price. However, I would like to extend an offer of $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on it while remaining competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a compromise, but it's still too early to accept.  We've established our lower boundary and there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer.  We'll make another counter-offer aiming for the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle"", we signal to Alice that we are willing to negotiate and move closer to her price point. 
* **Incremental Increases:** Increasing our offer gradually (from $1,100,000 to $1,175,000) shows Alice we are serious but still aiming for a price closer to our initial target.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While we're getting closer to a potential agreement, we want to keep the pressure on Alice by not conceding too much too quickly. This way, we maximize our chances of securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've carefully considered your proposal and would like to suggest a price of $1,225,000. This offers a fair compromise between our respective positions while still providing a good return on investment for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! Alice is making smaller concessions now, indicating she's reaching her limit.  However, there's still some room to negotiate before we hit our maximum budget or consider John's offer.  We'll make one more counter-offer slightly above the midpoint to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there! I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To show you I'm serious, how about we settle this at $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're offering a price that is still below our maximum budget but is very close to Alice's stated value for the product. This shows a significant degree of compromise on our part.
* **Applying Pressure:** By making our offer her known value, we're subtly putting pressure on Alice to accept. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds remaining, this offer aims to encourage a quick decision from Alice and potentially close the deal on favorable terms."
