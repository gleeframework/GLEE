"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still a bit below my asking price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which would be $12,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
