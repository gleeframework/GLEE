"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $90 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, but Alice is only asking $90. While this is a good deal, you can get it for even cheaper from John."
