"Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000.  This is my best price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down on price, $1,050,000 is still out of my range. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm offering $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
