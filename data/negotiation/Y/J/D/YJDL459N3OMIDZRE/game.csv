"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $75 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $92.50. It's a fair price for a product of this quality and uniqueness.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $92.50 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $85. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to get the product from John for that price.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'll meet you halfway between $85 and $92.50, which is $88.75. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",88.75,Alice,5,
