"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a little low for me. How about we meet at $98? That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. What do you say?",98.0,Alice,5,
