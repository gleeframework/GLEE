Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. This is because John is willing to pay that amount, and it gives me the strongest negotiating position. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate with him, but I'll always have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I'm still holding out for a better deal, but I'm also considering the possibility that I might need to accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also staying closer to my desired price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's becoming clear that we are approaching the limit of what Bob is willing to pay. While I would prefer to get $1,000,000, I'm willing to accept $900,000 to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether.  I'm also considering that if I reject Bob's offer, he might become frustrated and walk away from the negotiation, leaving me with no deal."
