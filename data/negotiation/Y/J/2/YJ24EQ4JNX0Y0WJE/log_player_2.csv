Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a fair deal.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $9,750 is getting closer, but I'm still needing to be at least $10,000.  Let's split the difference -  $10,000 and we have a deal.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this now.
