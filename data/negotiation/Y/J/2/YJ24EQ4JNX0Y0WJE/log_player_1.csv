"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and allows for some room to adjust the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my desired price:** I'm moving closer to my desired price, but still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Fairness and compromise:**  I emphasize the idea of finding a fair deal that benefits both of us.
* **Reiteration of product value:** I continue to subtly emphasize the value of the product to Bob. 

This counter-offer aims to keep the negotiation moving while trying to secure a better price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $8,000 is a big drop. While $13,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we settle around $9,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than I'd like. I'm not yet ready to sell at that price and believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you about the budget, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,000? That's a significant move from my last offer, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and meeting halfway:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraint and demonstrate willingness to compromise by offering a significant price drop from my last offer.
* **Focus on closing the deal:** I emphasize the desire to finalize the transaction, hoping to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reasoning and justification:**  I provide a justification for the offer by highlighting the compromise I've made. 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground, further narrowing the price gap, and signaling my intent to close the deal while still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. $11,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,750? It's a small step, but it might bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,750 is still below my desired value.  I'm not ready to sell at that price. I believe there's still potential for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $9,750 is getting closer, but I'm still needing to be at least $10,000.  Let's split the difference -  $10,000 and we have a deal.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final push for $10,000:** This is my absolute minimum threshold, and I'm making a final push to secure it.
* **""Split the difference"" approach:**  I'm proposing a compromise, which often creates a sense of fairness.
* **Urgency and finality:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal now to create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob. 

By offering to ""split the difference,"" I'm hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, while simultaneously ensuring that I get my minimum acceptable price.  This approach also serves as a strong indicator that I'm not willing to go lower."
