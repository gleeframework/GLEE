"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $10200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob, but I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10800. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be realistic about the product's value to me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000, and I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $11000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. If this offer is still not acceptable, I'll have to reconsider my options.",11000.0,Alice,9,
