"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. My asking price is $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a bit more than what I was initially thinking. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This feels like a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,750 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and drop my price to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I need to see some more movement from you. Can you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,8,
