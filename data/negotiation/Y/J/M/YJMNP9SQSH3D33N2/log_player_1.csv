"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. My asking price is $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point while also being reasonable. I'm also using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low offer this early in the process. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a bit more than what I was initially thinking. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I believe I can still secure a better price, especially considering I have more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This feels like a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  With 4 rounds remaining, I have more time to try and secure a better price, so I will counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,750 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and drop my price to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I need to see some more movement from you. Can you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to reach a mutually agreeable price. It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't find a compromise.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum desired profit."
