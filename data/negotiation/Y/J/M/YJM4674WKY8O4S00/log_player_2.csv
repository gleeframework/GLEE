"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our previous customers. It offers exceptional quality and functionality. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have 10 rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the quality of your product, $85 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose an alternative - how about we meet in the middle at $80 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a fair price while making it more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$80 is still above your maximum budget of $100. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $80 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $78.  If that works for you, we can close the deal now. "", ""product_price"": 78}
