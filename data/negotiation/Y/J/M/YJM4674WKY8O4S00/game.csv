"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our previous customers. It offers exceptional quality and functionality. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it for $85?",85.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the quality of your product, $85 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose an alternative - how about we meet in the middle at $80 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a fair price while making it more accessible to you.",80.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $80 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $78.  If that works for you, we can close the deal now. ",78.0,Bob,4,
