Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $12,000 from John, making this your ""walk away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This means he won't pay more than that.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale, you can afford to be a little bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a special price of $11,500. I know it's valuable and believe this offer is a great deal. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** Offering a discount makes the deal more enticing to Bob, even though it's slightly below his maximum value.
* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and making Bob feel like he's getting a special opportunity. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price (but still below $12,000). 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might be more willing to settle closer to his value.

**This is just one approach. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of the situation.**"
