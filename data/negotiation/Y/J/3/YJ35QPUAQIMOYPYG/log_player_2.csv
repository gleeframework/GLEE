"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that, there's no room for negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the product at your maximum price, while negotiating with Alice risks potentially going over budget or wasting time."
