"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, the product's worth is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
