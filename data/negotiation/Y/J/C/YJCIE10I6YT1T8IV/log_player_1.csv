I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but it also shows him that I value the product highly. I believe this is a good starting point, but I am prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at my minimum price, I believe I can still get more for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to consider.  While I was willing to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a safe and sure way to get at least my minimum value."
