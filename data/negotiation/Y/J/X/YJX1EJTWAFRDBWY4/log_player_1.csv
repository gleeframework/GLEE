Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $175, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me and only $100 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting at $175, I have space to negotiate down and potentially still make a good profit. 
* **Positivity:** The message is positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Knowing John is an option:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, it indicates he's interested in the product. This means there's room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price by coming down from my initial $175 to $140. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $140 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation going smoothly. 
* **Knowing John's offer:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $150, which gives me leverage if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my previous offer, it indicates he's still not willing to come close to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is higher:** I can sell to John for $150, which is a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as he seems unwilling to meet my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees a better outcome."
