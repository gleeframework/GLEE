"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget:** $11,000 is only $500 more than Bob's target price, and significantly less than John's offer.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation:** Bob could try to counteroffer again, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept. If she rejects again, Bob might be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **The current offer is a good deal:**  It's in Bob's best interest to accept and secure the product at a reasonable price."
