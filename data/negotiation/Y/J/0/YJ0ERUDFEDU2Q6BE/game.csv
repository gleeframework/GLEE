"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider the minimum value I need to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I am ready to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000, Bob, but I'm still not getting the minimum value I need for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is the best I can do.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
