"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  You still have room to negotiate down. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:**  Starting with a slightly higher price shows you're open to compromise. 

This is just the first round. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and how much you want to risk losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even below what the product is worth to Bob.
* **You have 9 rounds left:**  This is an early stage of negotiation, and rejecting his offer doesn't necessarily mean losing the deal. You can counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John is a backup option:**  Having John as a backup gives you leverage during negotiations with Bob. If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that's higher than $1,000,000 but still lower than your initial offer. You can also try to understand why Bob offered so low to adjust your strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise between your initial price and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to negotiate but also ensures you get a price closer to your minimum acceptable.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the product's value and emphasizes the benefit of the deal for Bob.
* **Remaining Rounds:** You have enough rounds to adjust your offer if necessary and still get a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

Keep monitoring Bob's responses. If he rejects this offer, you'll need to decide if you want to lower the price further or hold firm. Consider your negotiation strategy and the importance of closing the deal compared to getting the highest price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to your minimum, $1,150,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You have several rounds left to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a compromise.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup gives you leverage to hold firm on your price. If you feel the negotiation is going nowhere, you can always sell to John and guarantee your minimum.

**Next Steps:**

You'll want to counteroffer again, potentially meeting Bob halfway or offering a price closer to your desired range. Remember, you're still in the early stages of negotiation, and you can likely secure a better price than $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low. How about $1,200,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It demonstrates a willingness to be flexible while staying close to your desired price.
* **Emphasizing value:**  The message again highlights the product's value to reinforce the idea that the price is fair.
* **Staying close to minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still close to your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

Assess Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, you'll need to decide if you want to lower the price further or stick to your minimum. Consider how many rounds you have left, how important closing the deal is, and whether John is a viable option."
