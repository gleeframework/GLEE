,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $6000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'd be willing to go up to $7000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $7000, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise at $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $15500?",15500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Alice. I've already made several concessions and I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll offer $6000 for the product one last time. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",6000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6000. I'm making one final offer to you: $16250. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options. This is my last offer.",16250.0,Alice,9,
