"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, it's a risk, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me.  I'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't accept it.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount.  Even if we can't reach an agreement, I can still sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to see if we can get closer. I still want to make a profit, but I also want to make sure Bob doesn't walk away.  $900,000 is a fair compromise, I think."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to counter again.  I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to agree on a price, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm getting closer to John's offer.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be more inclined to sell to John, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counter with a higher price again.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I still think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to make my final offer to Bob.  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  If he rejects it, I'm going to sell to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close, but I've already had 7 rounds of negotiation.  I'm worried that Bob is just playing for time and isn't serious about reaching a deal.  To avoid further risk, I'm going to sell to John. It's a safe bet, and I'll still be getting a good price."
