"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product for $900,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it will be a great investment.  Let me know if you're interested, but please act quickly as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $900,000. So, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
