"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

This is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate for a lower price, accepting the $1,200,000 offer saves him $300,000 compared to John's price."
