Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $900000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $600000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $750000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and go with $700000.  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $725000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
