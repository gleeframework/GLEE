"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $140?  That way we both get a good deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
