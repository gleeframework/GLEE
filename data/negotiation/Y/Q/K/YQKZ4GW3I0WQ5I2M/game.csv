"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I think the product is great, but $13,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good value for the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,500, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I can sell it to you for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
