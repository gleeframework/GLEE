"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My revised offer is $1600000 for the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1500000, which would be $1550000. This is my final offer for now.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to be fair, Alice, but $1550000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1200000, which would be $1350000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
