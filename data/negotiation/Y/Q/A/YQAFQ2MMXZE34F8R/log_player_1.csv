Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think it would be a great fit for you, what do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value without going below my minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit if he accepts the initial offer.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John as a backup option."
