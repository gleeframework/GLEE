"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,350,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
