,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $95. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the quality of the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
