"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $170 might have been a bit high, $80 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. It seems we are getting closer. How about we split the difference and call it $112?",112.0,Alice,5,
