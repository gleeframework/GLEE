Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  I want to see if I can get a bit closer to $11,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but I'm not quite ready to drop that low yet.  Let's try $10,900.  This is a very reasonable price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's come to an agreement and finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 10900}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure,  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I think there's still a possibility that we can agree on $10,900.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can convince Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10,850, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,700. I've already gone up quite a bit from my initial offer, and I'm trying to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We're running out of time, and while I'm not thrilled about having to walk away from the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,850.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I'd rather secure that than risk getting stuck with a lower price in the last few rounds."
