Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (John's offer) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows Bob to counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere above his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if there's just John) might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob that's significantly more profitable than John's guaranteed offer while still leaving a small margin for negotiation."
