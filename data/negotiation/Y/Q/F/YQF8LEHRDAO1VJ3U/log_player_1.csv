Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum value ($8,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows for negotiation while ensuring you don't undervalue your product.  By having a higher starting price, you can potentially get a better deal for yourself.  If Bob rejects, you can always lower the price during counteroffers, but you will always have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. Bob has shown interest, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that is closer to my initial price of $10,000. This keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows me to achieve a better outcome.  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to accept his offer or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $9,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.  
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum. It gives Bob an opportunity to accept a price that is closer to my desired outcome.  If he rejects, I can decide whether to accept his previous offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9500. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  

**Strategy:**

This is a good compromise that secures a sale at a price that is still profitable for me.  It's important to recognize that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and I might end up selling to John for less."
