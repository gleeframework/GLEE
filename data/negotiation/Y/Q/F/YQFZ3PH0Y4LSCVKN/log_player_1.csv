Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a significant discount from the guaranteed price, making it enticing for Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly might be faster than waiting for John, even if the price difference is small.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I had that information, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
