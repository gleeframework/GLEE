Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you and am willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 
This takes into account:

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000.
* **Bob's valuation:** He's willing to pay $15,000, so there's room to negotiate upwards.
* **John as backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so don't be afraid to aim high with Bob.

By starting at $20,000, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit."
