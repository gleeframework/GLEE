"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  $11,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the most I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
