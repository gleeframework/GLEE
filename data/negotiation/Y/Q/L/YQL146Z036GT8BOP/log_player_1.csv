"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** The $115 price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider selling to John.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $100. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120.  
* **Negotiation:** It's still early in the negotiation process. I have several rounds left, so I can try to counter and see if we can find a more agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $120, I want to exhaust all options with Bob first. If the negotiation with Bob fails, then I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105? That's still a great value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial price, showing flexibility.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to further justify my price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for a few more rounds of negotiation, keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. Considering my budget, would $100 be possible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Negotiation Time:** We are approaching the midpoint of our negotiation rounds, and there's a good chance that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $120, it's not a guaranteed sale. It's better to secure a deal with Bob at my minimum acceptable price."
