Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leave Negotiation Space:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong fallback option with John, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offer is too low."
