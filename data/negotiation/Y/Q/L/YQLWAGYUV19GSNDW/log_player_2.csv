"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than John's price, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to a price that's more advantageous for you."
