"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
