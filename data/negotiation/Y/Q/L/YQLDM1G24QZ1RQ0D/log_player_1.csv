Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so this price is attractive but not overly ambitious.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, you have room to negotiate downwards without going below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **It reflects your confidence:**  Offering a slightly higher price shows that you believe in the product's value and are willing to be flexible. 

Remember, the key is to strike a balance between getting the best possible price and maintaining a good relationship with Bob in case you need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also below the value I know the product holds.  While I'm open to negotiating, accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise. It's halfway between my previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Fair price for both:**  While I'm reducing my price, $10,500 is still above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, making it a fair deal for both of us.
* **Positive tone:**  I've maintained a positive and respectful tone in my message to keep the negotiation friendly.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. It's a good starting point for further negotiations."
