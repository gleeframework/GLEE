"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a compromise that acknowledges your budget concerns.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. I will continue to negotiate, hoping to get the price closer to my budget."

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she might not budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure I get it within my budget."
