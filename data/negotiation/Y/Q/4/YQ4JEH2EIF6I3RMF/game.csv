"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a compromise that acknowledges your budget concerns.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part.  This price is closer to my budget while still allowing you a respectable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
