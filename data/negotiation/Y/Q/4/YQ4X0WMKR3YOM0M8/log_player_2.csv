Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you and the market value, I propose we start at $12000 for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9500 for the product. This offers a compromise between our initial values while still providing a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's willing to pay $8,000, and Alice's offer is still above that. There's room for further negotiation before considering buying from John."
