While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a price I'm comfortable with.  It's a good deal compared to buying from John for $10,000.  I'll accept the offer."
