""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You need to make at least $150, and John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob only values the product at $100.
* **Creating Value:** Offering the product for $125 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a product he values at $100 for a price lower than his valuation, and you earn a profit of $25 more than Bob values the product for. 

By starting with this offer, you leave room to potentially negotiate down to $100 if Bob tries to haggle but ensure you don't settle for a price that's lower than what you'd get from John."
