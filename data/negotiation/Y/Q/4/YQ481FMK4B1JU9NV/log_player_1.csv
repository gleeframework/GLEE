Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and implying you have other interested buyers, you encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
