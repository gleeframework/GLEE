Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that I can always sell to John for that amount.  This sets a strong initial position and allows for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering a price of $9500, which is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a significant improvement from his initial offer and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $10,000,  accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and earn a profit. Selling to John at $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to take a slight reduction for a faster sale."
