Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you!  Given its value, I'm offering it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information. If he flat out refuses, you know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, you can start negotiating downwards.
* **Safety Net:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
