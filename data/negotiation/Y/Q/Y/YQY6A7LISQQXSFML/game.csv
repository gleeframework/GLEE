"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can get a little closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
