 It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price, especially since Alice is already offering a discount.  We'll see if we can get it lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might walk away, and then I'd have to buy from John at a higher price.  I'll take this offer."
