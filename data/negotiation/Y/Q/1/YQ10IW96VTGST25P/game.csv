"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to go lower?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference at $15,000? This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  To be honest, I'm really close to accepting another offer for this product. However, I believe in this product and I'd like to see it in your hands.  How about we meet in the middle again at $13,750?  This is a fair price, and it will allow me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet. While I appreciate your flexibility, $13,750 is still a bit too high for me.  If we can agree on $13,000, I'd be happy to close the deal.  This is a fair price, and it would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're running out of time here, and I'm really close to accepting another offer for this product. To be honest, $13,000 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.  It's a great deal for you, and it lets me cover my costs. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  If we can agree on $13,500, I'd be happy to close the deal.  This is a fair price, and it would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",13500.0,Bob,8,
