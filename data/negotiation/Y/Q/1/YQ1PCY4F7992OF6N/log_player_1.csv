{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This allows for room to negotiate and increases the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, considering your eagerness to purchase.  Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe $10,000 is the maximum I can afford. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these figures? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal yet."
