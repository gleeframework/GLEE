"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you value the product highly, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I need to make a profit, and $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $9250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. Would you be willing to consider $8750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if $8750 is a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
