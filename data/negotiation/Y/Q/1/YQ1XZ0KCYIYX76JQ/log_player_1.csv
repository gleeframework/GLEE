Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring he gets a good deal. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** The negotiation can continue without you immediately hitting your ""walk away"" price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum price, it's worth trying to get closer to your desired $14,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting dangerously close to your minimum, and it's likely he won't budge much further. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you your minimum price and avoids the potential for a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
