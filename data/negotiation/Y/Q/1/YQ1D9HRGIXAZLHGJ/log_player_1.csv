Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it's a smart investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation increases the chance of a quick sale at a high profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still keeping you well above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to consider."
