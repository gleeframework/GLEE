Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
