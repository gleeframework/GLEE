"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can do $8,750, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $8,750 is less than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.
* **A slight compromise:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the difference between $8,750 and $8,500 is relatively small. 
* **Potential for a deal:**  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price.  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether."
