"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's get this deal done.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to the value I see in the product? I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for your product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is just too low. How about $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach a compromise. How about we aim for $1,325,000? This still allows me to save some money compared to what I value the product at, while providing you with a fair profit.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,340,000, which leaves some room for you to save while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product.  Let's close this deal now.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
