"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and positive, aiming to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* This strategy allows for potential negotiation while keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,200 is higher than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price. Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option if the negotiation with Bob proves unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,200 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000?  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $9,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial $8,200. This shows flexibility while maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:**  The message reaffirms Bob's interest while highlighting the value proposition.  It is polite but firm, leaving room for further negotiation without seeming overly aggressive.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while still maintaining the option to sell to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $9000. How about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still below my desired target. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since Bob has expressed continued interest in the product. By rejecting his offer, I maintain the opportunity to push for a higher price. 

Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option if the negotiation with Bob proves unsuccessful, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest,  $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $8,750 is a further compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to reach a deal.  It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit and fairness, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.  It also maintains a firm stance, not caving to pressure but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a better price and closing the deal, while keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult, and Bob's offers are not coming close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 

Given that we have limited rounds left and I'm concerned about further concessions leading to a significantly lower price, I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a successful transaction. 

While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, this decision prioritizes securing my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to an unfavorable outcome."
