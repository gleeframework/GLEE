,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This price is fair, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
