"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** A high initial offer can ""anchor"" the negotiation, making lower counteroffers seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is a way to see how Bob reacts. His response will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay and help guide your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. While his counteroffer is a slight increase from his perceived value, accepting now would mean a substantial loss.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if a mutually agreeable price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility by lowering the price by $300,000, but it avoids drastically dropping to Bob's level. This signals you're serious about selling but not desperate.
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's value, you reinforce your position that the price is justified.
* **Inviting a Counter:** This counteroffer leaves room for Bob to make another move, encouraging him to participate actively in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But Not There Yet:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price. However, it's still $100,000 below your safety net of selling to John. 
* **Negotiating Room Remains:** There are still six rounds of negotiation left. You have the time to see if you can push Bob a bit further.
* **Stronger Position:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer significantly suggests he's quite interested in the product. You can leverage this to your advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to be flexible, but  $1,100,000 wouldn't allow me to make the kind of deal I'm looking for. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  By coming down to $1,300,000, you are still above your guaranteed offer from John while signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Proposing to ""meet halfway"" frames the offer as a fair compromise, even though it's slightly more in your favor than a true midpoint.
* **Urgency and Commitment:** Highlighting your commitment to closing the deal adds a sense of urgency without appearing desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Your Safety Net:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches the amount John is willing to pay. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While you could potentially push for a bit more, Bob has declared this his ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Good Business:** Accepting this offer guarantees you a strong profit without the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing both Bob and John as buyers."
