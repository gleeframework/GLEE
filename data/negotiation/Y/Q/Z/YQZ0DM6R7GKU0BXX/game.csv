"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to be flexible, but  $1,100,000 wouldn't allow me to make the kind of deal I'm looking for. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
