Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have insider information that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, so offering it for $12,000 (your minimum) would leave money on the table.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start higher, aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value increases the chances of acceptance without seeming too aggressive.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. If Bob rejects the $14,000 offer, you haven't lost anything. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer appealing enough to accept."
