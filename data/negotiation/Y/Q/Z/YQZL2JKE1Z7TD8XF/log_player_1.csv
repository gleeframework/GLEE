Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $120. I think this price is reasonable, considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to get a good price, but $120 is still too low for me. How about $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
