Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to our guaranteed sale price. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act quickly.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
