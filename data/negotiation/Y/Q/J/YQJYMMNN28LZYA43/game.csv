"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product.  However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my limit and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $15000. Considering its true value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
