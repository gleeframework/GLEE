{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product!  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I know it aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm confident it will bring immense value to your business. My initial price is $900,000.  I believe it's a fair price given the product's worth, but I'm open to discussing it further.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? I think this price is still fair considering the immense value the product brings, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $775,000? I think this price is reasonable and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter again with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $775,000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $800,000? I think this price is reasonable and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm getting close to considering buying from John, but I'd like to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal for me, as Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. It's also a good strategy to accept the offer to avoid the risk of him changing his mind or potentially lowering his offer in the future."
