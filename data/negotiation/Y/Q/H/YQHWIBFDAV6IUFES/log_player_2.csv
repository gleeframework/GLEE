"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value ($12,000), but lower than your limit ($15,000).** This leaves room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **There's a chance to save money by counteroffering.** You can likely get Alice to lower her price a bit.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** Only if you can't get a better deal from Alice should you go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget and closer to your desired price.** This is a good compromise considering your initial goal was to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting again could lead to a stalemate or higher price.** There's a risk that Alice might stick to her $13,500 offer or even increase it.
* **Buying from John would cost more.** While John's offer is still available, accepting Alice's deal saves you $1,500.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. It allows you to purchase the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
