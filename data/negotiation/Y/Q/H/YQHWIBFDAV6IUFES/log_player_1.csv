{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're guaranteed to make at least $2,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving you the opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob will see this as a good deal and is more likely to accept or counteroffer than if you started at a higher price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $14000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is still a good profit, there's still some room for negotiation.  We can try to push for a higher price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
