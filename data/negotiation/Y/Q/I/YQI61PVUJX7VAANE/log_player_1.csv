``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also aware that I can always accept John's offer of $15,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which suggests he might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to it.  If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this point. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my desired price."
