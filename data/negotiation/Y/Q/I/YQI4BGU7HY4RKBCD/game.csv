"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $1,200,000. Let's start there.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of this product, and it's closer to my budget.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
