"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I initially offered, but still a bit lower. How about $1600000? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm open to negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've gone as high as $1200000, but I still feel that's a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $1700000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
