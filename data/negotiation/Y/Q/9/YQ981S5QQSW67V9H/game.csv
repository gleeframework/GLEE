"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering John is offering the same product for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
