Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $175, there's room for me to negotiate down if needed without going below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll either counter with a slightly lower price or choose to sell to John.
* If his counteroffer is closer to my minimum, I'll be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.  
* **Selling to John as a Backup:** While I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if a deal with Bob doesn't work out.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's price but still maintaining a margin above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value for Bob:** Emphasizing the deal's value for Bob (""still a great deal for you"") can encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** Keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation keeps the door open for a successful deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, we have a deal!
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider his counteroffer and potentially lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is only $15 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:**  If I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I might not be able to get a better price from him. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While $135 is not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $150, as it saves me time and effort.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer, finalize the sale, and move on to my next business opportunity."
