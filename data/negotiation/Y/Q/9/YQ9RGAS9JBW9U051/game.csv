"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further! I'm still a little hesitant at $105.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $102.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",102.5,Alice,5,
