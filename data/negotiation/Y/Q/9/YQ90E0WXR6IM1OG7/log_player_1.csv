"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This sets a high bar and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not aiming for a complete win in the first round, as this could lead to an immediate rejection. 

**Note:**  I'm also aware of the John option. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll consider if his counteroffer is worth pursuing or if I should cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he is showing interest in the product. This means there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm serious about getting a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still acknowledges Bob's budget concerns."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows you to stay within your budget. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, suggesting that $13,000 is a fair price considering its worth.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Note:**  I'm still keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000. However, I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between getting a better price than Bob's initial offer and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While Bob is showing commitment, the price is not close enough to what I need.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and I need to be mindful of the 10-round limit.
* **Weighing the options:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is still a very attractive option, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. However, I'll need to be more decisive in the following rounds to avoid running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and meet Bob's budget concerns.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to the message, highlighting that this is a chance to finalize the deal.  We're already halfway through the allotted rounds, and time is running out. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm reiterating the idea of a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

**Note:** I'm still considering the John option but also want to push Bob towards an agreement. This counteroffer is a strong compromise while leaving room for a final negotiation in the next round if necessary."
