Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but my product is truly worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $10,100 as a final compromise. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll receive.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm positioning this offer as a final compromise, implying a strong willingness to reach a deal while still upholding my desired profit margin.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive, hoping to sway him toward accepting the offer.
* **Urgency:**  By suggesting a final agreement, I'm subtly implying that the deal might not be available for long, creating a sense of urgency.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Response:**  I'll assess Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, I've secured a decent deal. 
* **Consider Selling:**  If he rejects or makes a counteroffer that is too low, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000. With only three rounds left, it's getting more risky to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Final Round Strategy:** If I do counteroffer again in the next round, I'll likely propose a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, knowing I can always sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I am committed to finding a price that suits both of us. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We are down to our last two rounds, and Bob's offer hasn't moved much from his previous offer. There's a significant gap between his offer and my minimum price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a price much lower than my minimum.  It's also possible Bob will not increase his offer in the final round. 
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

**Conclusion:**

Considering the limited time remaining and the uncertain outcome of further negotiation, I've decided to secure the guaranteed value by selling to John. While I'd prefer a higher price,  this decision protects me from potential losses and ensures I receive a fair value for my product."
