"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down closer to the $1,000,000 mark? I'm thinking $1,100,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
