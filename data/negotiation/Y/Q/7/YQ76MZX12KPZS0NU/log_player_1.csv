Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down closer to the $1,000,000 mark? I'm thinking $1,100,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's time to move on and secure the best outcome."
