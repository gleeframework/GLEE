"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to compromise, especially since her minimum price is likely below $15,000."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $16000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. This way, we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $16,000 is still above my budget and the value I place on the product.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. There's still room for compromise, as Alice's minimum selling price is likely below $15,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. It's a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $15,000, which is still above my budget. While I could try to counteroffer again, it's likely that we'll reach a stalemate. It's not worth risking further negotiation when I can get the same product for $10,000 from John.  It's time to move on and secure the product at a better price."
