"I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal happen.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $16000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. This way, we can both walk away happy.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000. It's a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
