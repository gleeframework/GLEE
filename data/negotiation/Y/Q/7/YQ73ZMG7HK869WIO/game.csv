"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I could meet you halfway at $1,175,000.  This is a fair offer considering your initial asking price and my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be closer to my bottom line. I'd be willing to accept $1,250,000. This is a firm offer, as I am confident I can get this price from my other potential buyer if needed.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
