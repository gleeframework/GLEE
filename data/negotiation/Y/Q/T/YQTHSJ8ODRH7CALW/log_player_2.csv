# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. I want to see if I can get a better price. There are 9 more rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to buy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, $1,000 below Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,800. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not quite there yet. I want to try and get her closer to my initial counteroffer of $10,000. With 7 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but this time I'm only asking for a $300 reduction.  This shows that I'm serious about making a deal and  I hope Alice will see this as a good compromise."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,500. How about $10,650? It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,650, which is only $650 above my last counteroffer and well within my budget.  With 5 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  This price is a good compromise, and I can accept it."
