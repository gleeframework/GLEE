"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $120. How about we meet at $130? It's the lowest I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,
