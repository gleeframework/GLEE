,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $7,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you consider $9,000? I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. I think that's a good compromise.",8500.0,Bob,4,
