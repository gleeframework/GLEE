"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth it to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9,500, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. To be honest, I'm really close to just going with John's offer of $10,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd hate to lose out on this product.",10000.0,Bob,6,
