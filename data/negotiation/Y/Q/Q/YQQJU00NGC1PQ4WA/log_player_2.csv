``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to save money, and Alice's initial offer is at his maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point, but closer than the initial offer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can secure a better deal. While buying from John is an option, Bob is still aiming to save money."
