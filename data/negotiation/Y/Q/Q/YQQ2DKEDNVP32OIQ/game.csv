"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product for me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
