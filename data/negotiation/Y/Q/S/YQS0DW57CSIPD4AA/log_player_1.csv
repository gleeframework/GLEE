Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more than Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:** While I don't want to reveal my minimum price, mentioning that the product is valuable and will meet Bob's needs might make him more amenable to the higher price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged. If he rejects the initial offer, I can always negotiate down, knowing my fallback option is secure."
