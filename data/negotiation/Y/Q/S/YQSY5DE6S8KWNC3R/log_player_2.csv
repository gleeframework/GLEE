"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $175 is above your maximum budget of $150. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so rejecting this offer makes the most sense."
