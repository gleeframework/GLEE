Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for Alice while still potentially being attractive to Bob, as it's significantly lower than the product's worth to him.  This approach starts the negotiation in a way that leaves room for potential counteroffers and further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is still a good profit, it's lower than the initial offer. Alice can likely get closer to her desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000, which still offers you a great value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice is willing to negotiate but still aims for a price closer to her initial offer. The message is friendly but firm, leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit away from that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice should accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good profit for her and higher than selling to John. Further negotiation may not lead to a significantly higher price, so it's better to secure the deal at this point."
