"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer, which is way over my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a lowball offer of $10,000. This gives us room to negotiate, and I think it's a fair starting point considering my maximum budget is $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is right at my budget limit, but I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the product entirely.  I'll accept the offer and buy the product for $12,000."
