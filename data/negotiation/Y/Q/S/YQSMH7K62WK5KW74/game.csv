,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $250 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $200. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $200 is still a bit more than my budget allows.  I'm firm on $80. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider my other options.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $180. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $180 is closer, it's still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $100. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow me to get the product without breaking the bank. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $220. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this high-quality product.",220.0,Alice,7,
