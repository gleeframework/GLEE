"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
