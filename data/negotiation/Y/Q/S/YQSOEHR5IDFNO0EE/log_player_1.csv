Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows you to potentially reach a higher price without risking a complete rejection.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep the negotiation open and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still lower than what you'd like to receive. There's a chance you can get closer to your initial offer by counter-offering.  It's worth risking a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to get a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,075,000, which is only $25,000 less than your counteroffer of $1,100,000. It's getting pretty close to your minimum price, and the potential gain from further negotiation is relatively small.  It's a good idea to accept this offer and close the deal."
