Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I'm confident I can get a better price than selling to John. This offer will give Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum value.  This counteroffer should be attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $95 is still a good deal for me. It's more than what John is offering, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher. It's time to close the deal."
