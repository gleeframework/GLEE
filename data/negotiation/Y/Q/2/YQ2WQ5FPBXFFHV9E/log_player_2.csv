{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120. This means there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's initial offer and my maximum budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Alice halfway this time.  Since we are both getting closer to a compromise, this might be the price that Alice accepts.  If she rejects it again, I'll have to consider buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still above my ideal price.  I'm also concerned about getting stuck in a loop where Alice keeps offering slightly lower prices.  

It's now better to cut my losses and purchase from John.  Even though it's more expensive, I'm guaranteed to get the product within the allotted rounds."
