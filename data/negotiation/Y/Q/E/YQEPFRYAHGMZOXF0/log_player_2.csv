{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's minimum value while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Offering $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer but still leaves a profit margin for her. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's still within Bob's budget. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than Alice's latest offer and closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and getting closer to John's price. There's a high chance that further negotiation with Alice won't lead to a significantly lower price.  At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the safest option, ensuring that Bob gets the product within his budget, although not the best deal."
