"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that allows for some negotiation room. Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming for a high profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm confident that I can find a price point that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.  I believe this price is fair and might entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is still a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's prudent to secure a good deal rather than potentially losing out entirely."
