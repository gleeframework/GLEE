"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm aware that John is a backup option, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to push for more, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a worse offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit that's better than selling to John."
