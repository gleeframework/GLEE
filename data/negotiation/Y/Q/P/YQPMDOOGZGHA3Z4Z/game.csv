"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,750. That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference again and try $11,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
