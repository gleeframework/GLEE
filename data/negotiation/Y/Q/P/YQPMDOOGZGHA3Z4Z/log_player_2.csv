It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can aim for a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is coming down in price, but we're still above my limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,750. That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference again and try $11,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has been stubborn on her price.  It seems unlikely she'll come down further, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to buy from John at this point to guarantee the purchase."
