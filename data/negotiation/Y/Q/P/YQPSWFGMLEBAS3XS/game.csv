"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $80.  Would you be willing to come down a bit to make this deal work for both of us?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  This would still be a great deal for you and I'd be happy to close the deal.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product today.",85.0,Bob,4,
