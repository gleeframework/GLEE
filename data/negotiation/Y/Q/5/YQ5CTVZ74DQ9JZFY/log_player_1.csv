"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm going to counteroffer with $95. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
