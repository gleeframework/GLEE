"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, I need to be realistic with my own goals. Would you consider $1,350,000? It's a significant figure, but I believe it reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
