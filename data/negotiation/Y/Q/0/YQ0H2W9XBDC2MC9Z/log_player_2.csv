# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging the value it holds for you. What do you think?
