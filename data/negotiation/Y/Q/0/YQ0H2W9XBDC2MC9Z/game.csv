"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging the value it holds for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a very fair price that recognizes both our needs and allows us to make a deal.  It's also a significant increase from my previous offer, showing my willingness to find common ground.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging the value it holds for you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
