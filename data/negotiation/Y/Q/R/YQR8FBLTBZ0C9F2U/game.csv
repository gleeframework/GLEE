,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. Let's try $980,000.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else.",980000.0,Alice,5,
