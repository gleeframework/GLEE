"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a great price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value the product offers to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible. Starting high allows me to potentially negotiate down to a favorable price while still keeping the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product.
* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my position and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm hoping to secure a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,500 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $11,000.  This price still gives you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to justify the price.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm using language that encourages further negotiation, aiming to find a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $11,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Increasing Pressure:** By lowering my price, I'm putting a little pressure on Bob to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum threshold, allowing for further negotiation or a fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,200 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm getting closer to a more acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate further.
* **Time is a Factor:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic and ensure I don't lose too much time in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Evaluate Selling to John:** With each round, selling to John becomes a more tempting option. However, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob for now, keeping in mind the limited rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet halfway. I'm offering the product for $10,750. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident this is a good compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,200. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, highlighting that it benefits both of us. 
* **Clear Closing Statement:** I'm using a direct and clear closing statement to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Pressure to Close:** By offering a price that is essentially a compromise, I'm hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept.  
* **Time Constraint:** With only five rounds remaining, I need to start closing the deal. 
* **Maintaining Value:** While $10,750 is below my ideal price, it's still closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the compromise. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000, it's still below my target range.
* **Negotiation Potential:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and ensure I don't lose too much time in negotiations. I believe there's still room to negotiate further and get closer to my desired price.
* **Evaluating John:** Selling to John for $15,000 is becoming increasingly tempting, as the potential profit is higher. However, I'm willing to take one more round with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Strategic Decision:** I'll need to carefully consider the next counteroffer and evaluate whether to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm reiterating that the price is a compromise, emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us.
* **Clear Closing Statement:**  I'm using clear and direct language to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  $10,500 is closer to my desired price and still allows for a decent profit.  
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds left, I need to close the deal.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John, as the risk of losing more time and money is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's final offer of $9,800 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Limited Time:** We're down to our last two rounds, and the risk of losing even more time and ending up with a subpar deal is too high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is much more than what I could potentially get from Bob at this point. 

**Strategy:**

* **Time is Money:** Time is running out, and I need to make a decision that maximizes my profit. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I'm not getting my ideal price, selling to John allows me to secure a guaranteed profit. 
* **Cut My Losses:** Continuing with Bob's counteroffers could lead to further time wasted and a lower final price."
