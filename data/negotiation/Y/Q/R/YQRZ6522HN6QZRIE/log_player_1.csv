Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000. 
* **John's offer:** $15,000. This is my safety net, guaranteeing I'll get my minimum price.
* **Bob's value:** $12,000. This is the maximum he's willing to pay.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering $14,000, which is a price Bob might be willing to accept, giving him a $2,000 savings. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** This offer gives me a chance to get a higher price than John's offer, while still having a good chance of Bob accepting. It balances the potential for higher earnings with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
