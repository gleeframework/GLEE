"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering $12,000, I'm leaving a good margin for both of us to find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Setting the Stage:** This initial offer establishes a baseline and signals my desire for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I consider fair. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he's interested in the product.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John guarantees a good price, but I'm not desperate. I have the luxury of trying to get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I consider fair. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation. It's possible Bob could be swayed to move closer to my price, especially if he really wants the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his bid.  

While I'm starting to get closer to the minimum, I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to accept a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm further reducing my asking price, demonstrating a clear intent to reach a deal.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This offer is a good compromise, nearly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering $10,500, I'm gauging Bob's maximum willingness to pay while still staying above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the risk of not reaching a deal.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  The negotiations are getting increasingly tough.  There's a good chance we'll keep going back and forth, potentially wasting more rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit that significantly exceeds my minimum. Given the potential for a prolonged negotiation and a lower final price, securing a guaranteed $15,000 is the best option at this point."
