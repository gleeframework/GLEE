Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I want to see if I can get a higher price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him.  It's safer to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum value and ensures I don't lose out."
