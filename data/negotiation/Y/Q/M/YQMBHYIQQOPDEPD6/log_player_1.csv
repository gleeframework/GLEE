Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $1,300,000, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects this price, his counteroffer is likely to be higher than if we started lower.
* **John as Backup:** We have the security of John's offer ($1,000,000). This knowledge allows us to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob.

**Important:** This is just the opening move. We need to be flexible and gauge Bob's reactions to adjust our strategy in subsequent offers and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* We have room to negotiate and try to bring Bob closer to our desired range.  
* We have the security of John's offer as a fallback option, so we're not desperate to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are making a substantial concession of $150,000 from our initial offer to show Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** We are still holding above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) by a significant margin. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price and potentially encourage Bob to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $1,150,000. I'd like to propose $950,000 as a more reasonable price. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob has only increased his offer by $50,000 from his initial $900,000, while we have come down $150,000. This suggests we might be reaching an impasse, and further negotiation might yield minimal gains.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer remains significantly below our absolute minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** We have the security of John's $1,000,000 offer. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a lower amount when we have a guaranteed buyer at our minimum acceptable price."
