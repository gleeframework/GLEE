"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer sets a strong starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and within your budget.  It demonstrates your commitment to a deal, while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is getting closer to your target, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get it lower by continuing the process and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to come down from her initial price.  Offering $95 keeps the pressure on her while also demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This price is still within your budget, and leaves room for a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is getting very close to your budget, it's still not ideal. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to secure the product at a guaranteed lower price. There's no guarantee that you can get a better deal with Alice, and you're running out of rounds.  It's more prudent to lock in the $100 price with John."
