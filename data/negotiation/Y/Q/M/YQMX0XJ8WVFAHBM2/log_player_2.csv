{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, but she is asking for $12,000. This is a clear indication that there is room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is still asking for more than the product is worth to her, and I'm still within my budget. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
