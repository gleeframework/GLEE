Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a good middle ground between my minimum value ($10,000) and Bob's maximum value ($15,000). It leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a good profit.  I'm confident that I can get a better price through negotiation, but if Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $11,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.  It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiation than to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,000 is my final offer.  This is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a slightly higher offer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,500 is a good compromise.  It's significantly more than John's offer of $10,000, and it's getting closer to my ideal price.  Further negotiation might result in a higher price, but it's risky. There's no guarantee that Bob will agree to a higher counteroffer, and I might end up with a lower price or even lose the sale. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
