Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to make you a deal. How about $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price and I still have rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $85?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $82.50 is a good price and it's more than what John is offering. I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
