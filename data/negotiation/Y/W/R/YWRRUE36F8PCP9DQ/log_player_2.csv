"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to make you a deal. How about $90?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $85?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

While $85 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit high. You'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
