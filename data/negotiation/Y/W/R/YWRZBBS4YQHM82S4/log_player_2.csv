"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no reason to immediately accept.  It's worthwhile to see if Alice is willing to negotiate down.  You have nothing to lose by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $1200000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This would still be a very good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise, but there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much as possible, and rejecting this offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to go even lower. You're in a strong position because you have a backup option with John."
