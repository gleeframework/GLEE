"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $1200000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This would still be a very good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $1300000, which would be a good middle ground for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
