"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9000.  It's getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $9250.  This is a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
