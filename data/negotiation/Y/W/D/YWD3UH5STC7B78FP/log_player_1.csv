Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for such a drastic reduction in price.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000? It's a fair price considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not able to go above $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is reasonable given his stance.  It's better to close the deal now rather than risk losing him and having to go with John."
