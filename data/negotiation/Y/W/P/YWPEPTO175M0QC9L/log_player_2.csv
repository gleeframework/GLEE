"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above your limit. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you. Therefore, you should reject her offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
