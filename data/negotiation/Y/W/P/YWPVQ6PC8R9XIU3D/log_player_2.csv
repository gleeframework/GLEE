# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can definitely do better than $1,100,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You're getting closer to your target price, and Alice seems willing to compromise."
