"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $1,350,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,325,000, which is closer to my maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,325,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000, but I'll throw in some additional features and support that will increase the product's value to you. I believe this revised offer is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
