"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,400,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice rather than accept the current offer."

After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can get closer to $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,325,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000, but I'll throw in some additional features and support that will increase the product's value to you.

While Alice is now offering the product at the same price Bob offered in the last round, they're also adding extra features and support. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John, even without the added features."
