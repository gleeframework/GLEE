"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,100,000,  I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target value with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. By showing flexibility, I hope to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's closer to my desired value than selling to John for $1,200,000.  We're still early in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing a potential sale to someone who might offer more later."
