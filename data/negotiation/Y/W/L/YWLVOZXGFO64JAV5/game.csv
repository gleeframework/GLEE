"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  I'm really hoping to close this deal today.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $11000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to listen to your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $12500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11500.  This is the very best I can do.  Let's close this deal!",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to make this work, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12250. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,7,
