"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to create room for negotiation.  $9,000 is still within Bob's budget, but it also signals Bob's willingness to compromise while trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's getting closer to Bob's target, it's still worth pushing for a lower price. There are still rounds available to negotiate, and Bob can always opt for John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a better price. The offer of $9,500 is a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, especially if she wants to close the deal before Bob decides to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a bit above Bob's maximum budget.  However, it's getting close to John's price, and there are still rounds left. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally making an offer that matches John's price. This is a strategic move for several reasons:

* **Pressure:** This puts pressure on Alice. She knows Bob can walk away and get the product for the same price from John.
* **Last Chance:** This could be Bob's last chance to get a better deal from Alice. If she rejects this offer, Bob has no reason to continue negotiating with her. 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** Alice might be willing to accept Bob's offer to avoid losing the sale completely."
