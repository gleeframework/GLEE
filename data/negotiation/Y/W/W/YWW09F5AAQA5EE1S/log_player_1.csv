"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This sets a strong initial position and leaves some room for concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I can still push for more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer him a price of $1,650,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and within the negotiation range.  There's a good chance we won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
