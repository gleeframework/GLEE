I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more by counter-offering. I'll need to be careful, though, as I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for me to make a profit above my minimum of $800,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown he's willing to pay a significant price for the product.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is a very good deal.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
