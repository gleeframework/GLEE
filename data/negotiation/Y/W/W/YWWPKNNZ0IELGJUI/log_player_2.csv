# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $18,000 is still too high for my budget. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm motivated to find a solution, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I can accept. Let's settle this at $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down further.  If that fails, I'll buy from John."
