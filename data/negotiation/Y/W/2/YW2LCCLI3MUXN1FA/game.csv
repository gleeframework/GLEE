"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for everyone.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,325,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still not quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,340,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to offer $1,330,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1330000.0,Bob,6,
