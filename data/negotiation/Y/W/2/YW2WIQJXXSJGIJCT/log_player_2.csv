{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is still below his maximum price of $12,000 and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial offer, it is still higher than Bob's target price.  Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, and he's already shown he wants a lower price. There's still room to negotiate, and it's worth trying to reach a more agreeable price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,750. This shows he's willing to compromise, but he's still keeping the price below his maximum value and closer to Alice's likely minimum.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even though it's slightly lower than her previous offers.  Bob is aiming for a price closer to $8,500, and he's still got five rounds left to try and get there.  Rejecting the offer gives him more opportunities to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again to $9,000.  This is a significant step towards Alice's offer, showing that Bob is willing to compromise.  However, it's still a bit lower than her latest offer, leaving room for further negotiation and potentially closing the deal in the next few rounds. This move is calculated to test the waters and see if Alice might be ready to accept a deal closer to Bob's preferred range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at $10,000, which is getting close to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  However, with only three rounds left, it's not certain if further negotiation will lead to a price Bob is comfortable with.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John for $12,000. This ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and doesn't risk going over it in the remaining rounds."
