"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I think the product's value is higher than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the price John is willing to pay. This is the best offer I can make, considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of my budget constraints, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, so I'd like to make a serious offer. Please consider it carefully.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9,700, which is the best I can do considering the product's value to you. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",9700.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to think that I might be better off buying from John at $8,000. Please consider this as my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,10,
