"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's also a bit low considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and you should aim to secure a better price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to let it go for $1100000. Considering its value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still lower than your initial counteroffer of $1,100,000. There is still room for negotiation, and you can likely secure a better price.  You should continue to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to let it go for $1075000. Considering its value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll counteroffer at $1080000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price:**  Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $30,000 away from your last counteroffer of $1,075,000.
* **There's not much room for further negotiation:** While you could try to negotiate a bit lower, the difference is small. It's likely that further negotiation will take more time and might not result in a significantly better price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  You have a limited number of rounds, and continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or you being forced to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the potential risks and the small difference between your desired price and Alice's offer, it's a good idea to accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $1,080,000."
