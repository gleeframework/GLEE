Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can get closer to my goal price with more negotiation."
