"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're aiming for a price of $80 or less, and $110 is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still above your target price of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has repeatedly shown she's unwilling to budge much below $100. Since you're happy to pay $80 to John, it's time to take the safe option and buy from him.  Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to yield a significant price drop."
