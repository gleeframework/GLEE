Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  This is the highest price Bob is willing to pay.  Any higher, and Bob will refuse the offer.

**The Risk:** If Alice asks for the full $1,200,000, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate for a lower price.  Alice needs to leave some room for negotiation but maximize her potential earnings.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its value and your position, I'm willing to make a deal at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:**  The message is framed to be positive and emphasize value. By mentioning Bob's ""position"", Alice implies the product is particularly beneficial to him. 
* **The Price:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount, making the deal very attractive. This price also gives Alice room to potentially negotiate up if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay. If she had that information, she could offer it directly."
