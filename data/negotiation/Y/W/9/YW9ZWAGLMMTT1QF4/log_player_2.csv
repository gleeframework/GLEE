Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,750 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $10,000 to John outweighs the potential gain of a slightly lower price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price."
