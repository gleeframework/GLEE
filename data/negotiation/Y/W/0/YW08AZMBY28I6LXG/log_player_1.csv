Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $120, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a price slightly below John's offer could lead to a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $119 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer. It also anchors the price close to its true value to you. 
* **Time Value:** Even though it's a small difference, selling to Bob at $119 is preferable to waiting for John if Bob accepts immediately."
