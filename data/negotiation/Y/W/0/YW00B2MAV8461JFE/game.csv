"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite willing to go down to $105 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $109? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",109.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $111? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if that works for you.",111.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and my original offer of $110. How about we try $109.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",109.5,Alice,7,
