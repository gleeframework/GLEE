{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to potentially negotiate down. It's important to be friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I need to hold out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a good compromise and secures a sale.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the transaction."
