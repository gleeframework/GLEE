"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
