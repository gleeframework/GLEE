"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000. There's room to negotiate a price that benefits both parties."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a decent profit on this deal.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
