"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially secure a good profit.  I'm also considering that I could sell the product to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering:

* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid selling to John for $15,000 if I can get a slightly higher price from Bob.
* **Risk of further negotiations:** There's no guarantee Bob will raise his offer in the next round, and it's possible he might even lower it. 
* **Value of the deal:** $14,000 is significantly better than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

By accepting this offer, I'm securing a profit and closing the deal."
