"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but I need to be closer to $18,000 for this to make sense for me. It's a high-quality product that will bring you a lot of value over time.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's benefits, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. Can we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
