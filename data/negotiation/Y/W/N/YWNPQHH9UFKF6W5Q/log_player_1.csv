Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but I need to be closer to $18,000 for this to make sense for me. It's a high-quality product that will bring you a lot of value over time."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's benefits, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely he will reach my $15,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. Accepting his $14,000 offer would be a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
