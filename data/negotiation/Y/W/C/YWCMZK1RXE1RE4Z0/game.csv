"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 represents a more accurate reflection of the product's true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be fair to us both, I can't go any lower than $1,425,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,425,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
