"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Alice is motivated to sell, and you have room to maneuver.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You'll use this if negotiation fails, but it's not the ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still acknowledges her need to make a profit.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still a gap between your offer and Alice's value, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Sets the tone:** Demonstrating your willingness to negotiate aggressively can encourage Alice to be more flexible in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above what you're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** There's room for both sides to compromise.
* **Buying from John remains a last resort.** You're still better off trying to reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's minimum:**  This offer is likely Alice's minimum acceptable price, as it matches her value for the product. 
* **Final offer before John:**  This is a strong offer, and if Alice rejects it, you'll likely have to resort to buying from John. 
* **Demonstrating willingness to compromise:**  This shows you're serious about buying the product but are still trying to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is only $20,000 above your previous counteroffer, and getting a deal this close to your desired price is a good outcome.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting this offer might lead to further negotiation rounds, but there's no guarantee of a better price, and you risk having to buy from John at a much higher cost.
* **Time is running out:** You've already gone through several rounds, and there's a chance you might not be able to reach a better deal in the remaining rounds."
