"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I can go down to $9,000, but that's my absolute final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is close, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $8,000 minimum in the remaining rounds.  John offers a guaranteed $8,000, making it the safer and more profitable option at this point."
