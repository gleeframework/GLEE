"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,600,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,750,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to accept that amount if it means closing the deal today.  Does that work for you?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
