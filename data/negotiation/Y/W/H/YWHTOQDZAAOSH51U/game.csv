"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. Let's meet in the middle - I'm proposing $1,500,000. This considers both our positions while still reflecting the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,400,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's close this deal - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price considering the potential this product holds.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
