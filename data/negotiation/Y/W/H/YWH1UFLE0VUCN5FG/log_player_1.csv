Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, reflecting your desire to maximize profit. It also shows a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he can get a good deal.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $7,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and sell the product, I'm going to stick to my goal of maximizing profit. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500,  which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better solution. I would like to suggest a price of $8,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal! Bob's offer is just slightly below my minimum price, but it's only a small difference.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with John's offer, which is lower.  I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
