Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're so close to a deal. However, I've already made a significant concession, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.

Alice is sticking to her guns and it's unlikely she'll go lower. Accepting at $1,050,000 is still a decent saving compared to John's offer."
