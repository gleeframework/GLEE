I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob than from John, but I'm also willing to walk away if the negotiations don't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000, but I'm not going lower than that. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that Bob clearly wants it."
