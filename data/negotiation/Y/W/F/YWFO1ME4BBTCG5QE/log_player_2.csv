"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her product valuation. There's a lot of room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but we're still far from a desirable price.  We'll continue to push the negotiation closer to our ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to settle for $10,200?"",
""product_price"": 10200
}
```

This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise but also sets a firm target that is significantly more advantageous than accepting Alice's current offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the price higher than I'd like. While she's making concessions, the pace is slow. It's time to signal I'm willing to walk away if I don't see a more significant move towards my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price difference is still too large for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, but if we can't agree on that, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Compromise:** It moves closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Firmness:**  The price is still significantly below her last offer, reinforcing my position.
* **Alternative:** Introducing the possibility of walking away (""other options"") adds weight and might incentivize Alice to concede further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  $11,000 is a $4,000 savings compared to John's offer and a decent compromise from our initial offers.
* **Stalemate Risk:**  Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Pushing further might lead to a deadlock and force us to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now has its own value."
