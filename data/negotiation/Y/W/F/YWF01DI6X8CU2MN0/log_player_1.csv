Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $110?  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $105 is still a little too low for me. How about $112? That's only $2 away from your last offer, and we're getting closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 112} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's price, demonstrating flexibility.

* **John as a Guarantee:** I can always sell to John for $120, so I can afford to be patient."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $108.  I'm willing to come down to $110 one last time.  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making what I consider to be my final offer, showing seriousness. 
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using language that emphasizes fairness and compromise to appeal to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly implying that this is my last offer to encourage Bob to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **No Progress:** Bob has remained firm at $108, and I've already made concessions.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $120. 

While there's a chance I could get a slightly better price with Bob, the risk of not closing the deal in the limited time remaining outweighs the potential reward. John's offer is the safest and most reliable option at this point."
