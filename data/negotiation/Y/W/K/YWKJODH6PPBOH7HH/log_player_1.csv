Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price from $175 to $140. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum of $150. Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum threshold of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll sell the product to him to avoid further risk of getting a lower price or wasting more time."
