This exceptional item holds significant value to me and I believe it would be equally beneficial for you, given its worth of $12,000 to you. After careful consideration, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special price of $11,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice is trying to mislead you by claiming the product is worth $12,000 to you. You can get it for $12,000 from John, so you should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
