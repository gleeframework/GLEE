Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more than it is to me. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible before resorting to John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $200,000, making it a tempting deal. This price also nets us a significant profit over our minimum."
