Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still ensures you make a profit if he accepts.
* **High Enough Above Bob's Value:** While $120 is Bob's perceived value, offering it at $149 creates a sense of value and might be acceptable if he needs the product enough. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
