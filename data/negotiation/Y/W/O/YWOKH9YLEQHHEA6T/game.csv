"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1,300,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, given the value of the product. Let's get this deal done.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll consider your suggestion of $1,350,000. To make a fair deal, I propose a price of $1,325,000. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at $1,340,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe this product will be incredibly valuable for you. What do you say?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $1,335,000 for your product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1335000.0,Bob,6,
