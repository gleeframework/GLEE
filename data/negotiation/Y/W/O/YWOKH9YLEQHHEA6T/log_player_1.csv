Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1,300,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is still a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired amount with further negotiation.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, given the value of the product. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll consider your suggestion of $1,350,000. To make a fair deal, I propose a price of $1,325,000. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting closer, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm not feeling pressured to close the deal yet, so I'll see if I can push for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at $1,340,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe this product will be incredibly valuable for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1340000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $1,335,000 for your product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,335,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired amount.  I've reached a point where I'm confident I won't get a significantly higher offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $1,335,000 is a good return for me, and it seems like a fair compromise for both of us."
