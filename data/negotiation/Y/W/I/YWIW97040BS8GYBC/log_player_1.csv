Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in your product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it, but I am hoping we can find a price closer to what I'm comfortable spending. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I want to explore if I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see where it leads."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm proposing a price of $875,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 875000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $860,000 is tempting, I'm still not at my minimum. I have more rounds to negotiate and want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $862500. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is very close to my minimum, and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation. I want to avoid the risk of losing a deal altogether by pushing for a higher price, especially since I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's better to secure a profit than to hold out for more and possibly get nothing."
