Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $135.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better deal. It's risky to accept as we only have three rounds left before I have to buy from John. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $139, and you're still not meeting me at that price. I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement. I'm going to have to consider selling to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at the end of the negotiation and Alice is firm on her price.  It's more advantageous to buy from John at $150 than to continue negotiating with Alice.  While it's more expensive, it guarantees a purchase and prevents the risk of Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
