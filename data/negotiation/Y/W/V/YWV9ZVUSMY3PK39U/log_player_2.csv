"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice. $90 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met us closer to the middle ground. $82 is a good price, saving us $18 from John's offer and leaving Alice with a profit.  There's not much room left for negotiation without being unreasonable, so accepting is the best choice."
