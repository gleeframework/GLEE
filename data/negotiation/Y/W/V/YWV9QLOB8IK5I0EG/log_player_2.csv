"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I understand that's above your budget, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin.
