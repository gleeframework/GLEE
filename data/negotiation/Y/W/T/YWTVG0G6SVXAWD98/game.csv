"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to miss.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget.",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you on your budget concerns, but $10,200 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer the product for $10,750. This is a final compromise from my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal!  I'm willing to go down to $10,600. This is a final compromise from my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this and make it happen!",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $10,600 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to think carefully about the value of the product.",10500.0,Bob,8,
