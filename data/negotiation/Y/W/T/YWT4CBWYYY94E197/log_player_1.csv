Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1675000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider that?
