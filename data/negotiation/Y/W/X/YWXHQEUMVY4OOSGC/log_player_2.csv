"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's room for further negotiation, Bob has already indicated his final offer and is likely not willing to go higher.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it makes sense to take the guaranteed deal with John rather than risk a further rejection from Alice."
