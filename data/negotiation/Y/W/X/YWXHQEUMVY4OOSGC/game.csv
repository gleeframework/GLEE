"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
