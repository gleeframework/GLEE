"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth $15,000 in value to you, and to kick off negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? ",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I could be flexible and come down to $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a very fair offer considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,5,
