Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I could be flexible and come down to $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a very fair offer considering the product's value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice has reached her bottom line and it's a good deal for you.  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, and you risk losing the opportunity."
