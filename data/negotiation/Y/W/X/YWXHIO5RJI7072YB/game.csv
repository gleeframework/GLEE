,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $105, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $125? I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount, but I still need to make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $125 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Let's see if we can find a solution here.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $115, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount, but I still need to make a fair profit.",130.0,Alice,7,
