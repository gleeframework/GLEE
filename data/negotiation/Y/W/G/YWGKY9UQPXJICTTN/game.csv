"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? That gives us both a good deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  $125 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference at $130.  If this isn't acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a sale, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $122 for the product. Can you consider that?",122.0,Bob,6,
