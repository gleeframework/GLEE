"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get the price down closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $8,800, Bob is still saving $1,200 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, and further negotiation might not get a significantly better price, especially considering Alice is already willing to sell for less than the product's value to her."
