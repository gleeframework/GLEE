"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations. Given the value this product brings, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Justification:** The message frames the high price by emphasizing the ""value this product brings."" 
* **Alternative:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum price, giving me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. My counteroffer for the product is $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is above his perceived value, showing he's willing to negotiate higher.
* While I could sell to John for my minimum, there's still room to negotiate with Bob for a potentially better deal. 
* Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer but staying well above both Bob's counteroffer and my minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting a ""middle ground,"" I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to reinforce the product's value, subtly pushing back against Bob's lower valuation. 
* **Time Consideration:** I'm conscious of the limited rounds and want to guide the negotiation towards a favorable outcome before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've given this some thought, and I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant profit over my minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds potentially lowering the final price or reaching an impasse. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
