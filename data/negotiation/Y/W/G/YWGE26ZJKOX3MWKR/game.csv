"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise. However, $16,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $14,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $15,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I really want to get this product. ",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept.",15000.0,Alice,7,
