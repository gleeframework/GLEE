{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum value:**  This gives you some wiggle room to potentially make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're offering and what he's getting. 

By starting with this offer, you create a starting point for negotiation and increase your chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  While I could accept it and make some profit, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This gives us both a fair deal and allows you to get the product you want."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000, but it's getting closer.  At this point, it's likely we won't reach a higher price with further negotiations.  I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal, as it's better than selling to John for $12,000."
