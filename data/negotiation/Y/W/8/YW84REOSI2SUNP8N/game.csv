"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a good offer, but I'm holding out for $112.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $112. How about we meet at $108? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,4,
