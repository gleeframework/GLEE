Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $109? It's the last bit of wiggle room I have, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer. $109 is still a good price for me, and it's better than selling to John for $100. I'm also getting closer to my desired price and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
