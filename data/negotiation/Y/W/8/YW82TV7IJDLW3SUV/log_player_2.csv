"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Please let me know your decision, as I have another interested party who is willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
