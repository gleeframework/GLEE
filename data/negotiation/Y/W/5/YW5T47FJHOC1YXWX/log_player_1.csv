"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still securing a profit above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping Bob is interested and will counteroffer.  If he doesn't, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering at $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  I've already established that I'm willing to sell to John for this amount, so it's pointless to risk further negotiation.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
