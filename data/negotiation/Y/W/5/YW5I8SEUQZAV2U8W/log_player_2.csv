Alice's offer:

This is a fair compromise, and a price I believe represents a good value for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower.  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise to ensure you secure the product at a price significantly below John's offer."
