"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, I know the product is worth $150 to me.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
