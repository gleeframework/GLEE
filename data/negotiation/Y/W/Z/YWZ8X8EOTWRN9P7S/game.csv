"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $10,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
