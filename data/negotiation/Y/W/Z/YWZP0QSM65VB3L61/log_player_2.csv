"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm definitely interested, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than his maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* While Bob could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or simply walking away from the deal exists. Accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price."
