"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer because it's higher than my budget of $120. I will also reject the option to buy from John for $120, since I want to see if Alice will offer a lower price.
