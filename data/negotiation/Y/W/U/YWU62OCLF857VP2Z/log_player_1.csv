Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150 (John's price), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit than I'd get from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.  
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value, hoping to nudge Bob towards seeing the deal favorably. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. I'm prepared to adjust based on Bob's response to maximize my chances of a successful sale."
