Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value, and it might entice Bob to accept quickly. However, I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I can always lower the price if Bob isn't happy with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay less while still keeping my profit margin above my minimum target.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that satisfies me.  It's becoming clear that he's unwilling to pay what the product is worth, and further negotiation might just waste time.  It's time to move on to John, who's already willing to pay my minimum price."
