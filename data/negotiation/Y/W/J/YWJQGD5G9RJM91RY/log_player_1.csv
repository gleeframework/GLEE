Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a price of $18,000, you're setting a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""fair"" price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always decrease your asking price, but you can't increase it once an offer is made."
