"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $80. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You know you can get the product from John for $80. Since you value the product at $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, but since you have a guaranteed alternative, there's no need to risk it."
