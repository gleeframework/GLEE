Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, hoping to capitalize on his potential desire to get the product.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so I'm not overly desperate to make a deal with Bob. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, but this starting point is a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.
* **Potential for counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is too low, he's shown interest and willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's potential for a higher counteroffer from him.
* **John's offer provides safety:** I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so I can afford to be patient and push for a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,500 is too far below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway from my initial offer of $9,500 to Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Maintaining profit margin:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Showing flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate, hopefully encouraging Bob to come up with a higher offer. 

I'm confident that $9,000 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still well below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob seems determined to get the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate. There's a chance I can push him closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **John provides safety:** I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, giving me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob without losing out. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a final counteroffer that aims to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $9,250 as a final compromise.  This is a great price for a product you've shown you really want.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, aiming to close the deal while still securing a decent profit.
* **Meeting halfway (again):** This offer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $8,750.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I highlight the value of the product and emphasize that this is a good price for both of us.
* **Closing the deal:** I use phrases like ""final compromise"" and ""make this deal happen"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't come around."
