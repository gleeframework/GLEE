"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which reflects the value I place on the product and is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
