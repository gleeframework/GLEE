"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price that's within his budget. There's still potential for a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which reflects the value I place on the product and is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $980,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000.  Given that Alice has already made her ""final concession,""  continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better result.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept John's offer and buy the product for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
