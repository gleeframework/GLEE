"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to see if Bob is genuinely interested and has a budget close to my desired value.  This allows me to gauge his potential and see if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum desired value of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but staying above my minimum acceptable value. This shows a willingness to compromise, but also demonstrates that I still believe the product is worth a significant amount. This might encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  I'm committed to seeing if I can get closer to my desired value before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm making one final counteroffer, lowering the price further to show flexibility.  I'm still above my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the deal.  If he rejects, I will accept John's offer to ensure I receive at least my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is now offering it. There's no need to continue negotiations, especially with John offering the same price.  It's time to secure the deal."
