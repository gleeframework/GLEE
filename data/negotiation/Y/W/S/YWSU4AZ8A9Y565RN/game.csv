"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be worth a maximum of $800,000 for me. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 to make this a worthwhile deal for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where this makes sense for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be willing to negotiate.",750000.0,Alice,5,
