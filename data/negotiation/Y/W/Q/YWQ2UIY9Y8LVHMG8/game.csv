"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. Can we meet at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
