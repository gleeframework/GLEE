"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the market.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However,  $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you, and it allows me to secure a reasonable return. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
