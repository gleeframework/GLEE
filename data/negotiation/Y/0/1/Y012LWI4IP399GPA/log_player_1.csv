Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than $8,000, given that he values the product at that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not happy with it. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
I'm offering a price closer to the middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, while still allowing me to earn a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price and is also significantly higher than what he initially offered. This is a good compromise and I'm comfortable accepting it."
