"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
