I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more appealing price for Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable. I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000, and it seems like he's not willing to come up from his low offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
