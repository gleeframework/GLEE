Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Starting High:** Opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""demand,"" you create the perception that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, you will immediately sell to John for $10,000. There's a trade-off between aiming high and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
