"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive. 
* **Leaving space for counteroffers:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without me immediately having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable deal.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm counteroffering at $12,500, which is still below my ideal price but significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a firm value for the product.
* **""Meeting in the middle"" approach:**  This phrasing makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable and less adversarial. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as being fair for both of us, which can help Bob feel more comfortable considering it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $12,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation falling apart is high.
* **John as a safety net:** If this deal doesn't work out, I can still sell to John for $15,000.  

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer seems like the best way to secure a sale quickly and avoid potential further negotiation delays."
