"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $1400000? I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1450000. I believe this price still represents a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. While I understand the value in your product, I'm still looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1425000? I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1425000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1425500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1425500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I've done my best to stay within my budget while still valuing the product. Unfortunately, I cannot accept $1425500. Could we perhaps aim for $1424000? This would allow me to secure the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1424000.0,Bob,6,
