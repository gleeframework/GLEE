"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm really only looking to spend around $85 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $95 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still feeling a bit high at $90.  How about $87?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer $90, Bob's offer of $87 is still a good deal for me. It's only $2 less than my ideal price and much better than selling to John for $80."
