Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'm happy to sell the product for $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price and still provides a good margin for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
