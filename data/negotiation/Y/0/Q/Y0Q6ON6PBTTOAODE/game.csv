"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit higher than the product is worth to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'm happy to sell the product for $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price and still provides a good margin for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10,500 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
