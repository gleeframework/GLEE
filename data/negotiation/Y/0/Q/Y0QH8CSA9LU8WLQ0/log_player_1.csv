"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,500,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's a calculated risk, hoping to tempt Bob into closing the deal.  I'm confident this offer is close enough to be attractive, but still within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer, but still below my desired price.  I've already made significant concessions and the risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob will walk away entirely.  To ensure I secure a sale that meets my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000."
