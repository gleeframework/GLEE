"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth less to him, so he'll likely counteroffer. We'll see how far we can go before I need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is still well above what Bob offered, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will spark a more productive discussion with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  I'll counteroffer again.  We're getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a decent price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still hesitant.  John's offer is very tempting, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. One more counteroffer, and then I'll seriously reconsider John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer. If Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John. It's a million dollars, which is a good deal for him, and I'm getting as close to my minimum as I can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit.  I'm not going to get any closer to my minimum with Bob. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John.  A million dollars is better than nothing, but I'm not willing to risk a smaller profit for the chance that Bob will accept my price."
