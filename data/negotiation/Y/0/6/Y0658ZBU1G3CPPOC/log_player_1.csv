"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and hopefully find a meeting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, given that we are already in round 4, I need to start considering the potential loss of selling to John. Rejecting again, allows me to explore further negotiation possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to Bob's value of $8,000. At this point, I'm balancing the need to get a decent price with the risk of losing the deal to Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price. I'm hoping to secure a deal before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price, and we are already in round 6. With limited rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
