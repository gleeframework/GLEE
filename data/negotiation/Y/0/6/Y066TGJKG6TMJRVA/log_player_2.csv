"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from its true potential value. I'm confident you'll see the immense potential of this product. Please consider my offer carefully.
