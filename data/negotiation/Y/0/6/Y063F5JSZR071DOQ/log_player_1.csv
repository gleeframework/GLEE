"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fair starting point as it's above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than the $80 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little steep for me, how about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm offering $85, which is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer.  It's still a good deal for me, and I hope it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering my absolute minimum price of $80.  This is the point where I'm comfortable selling to Bob, as it's still better than selling to John for $80."
