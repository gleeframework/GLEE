Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a good deal for me.  There's no guarantee I could do better elsewhere, and it's not worth risking losing the deal at this point."
