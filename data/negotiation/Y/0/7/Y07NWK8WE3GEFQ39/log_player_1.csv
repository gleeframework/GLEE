Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides you with leverage. You can walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $850,000 confirms he values the product considerably. While it's below your target, it's significantly above his perceived value ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of selling to John for $1,000,000. Therefore, you can afford to be assertive in the negotiation with Bob. 
* ** Aiming Higher:** You can aim for a price closer to $1,000,000 by strategically countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product has significant inherent value to me, and I need to see a price that reflects that. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While you're aiming higher, you've made a significant concession from your initial offer ($150,000 reduction). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""inherent value"" emphasizes that your price isn't arbitrary.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer moves closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It encourages Bob to make a more substantial move if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $950,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a decent sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and a substantial amount above his perceived value of the product. 
* **Minimal Gain in Further Negotiation:**  While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Further negotiation prolongs the process and delays receiving payment. 

This offer represents a good compromise, allowing you to secure a price well above your minimum and Bob to acquire the product at a price he finds acceptable."
