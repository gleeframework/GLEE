"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product has significant inherent value to me, and I need to see a price that reflects that. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $950,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a decent sale.",950000.0,Bob,4,
