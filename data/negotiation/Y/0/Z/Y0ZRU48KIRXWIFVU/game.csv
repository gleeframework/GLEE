"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, your starting price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $600,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $900,000 to be comfortable. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price point. However, $900,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I could make a move up to $700,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Would you be willing to consider this price?",850000.0,Alice,5,
