"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,075,000? It's still a good deal for you, and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but I can't go any lower than $1,100,000.  This product is truly unique and worth every penny. It's a significant investment for you, but it will bring you substantial long-term returns. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm not convinced it's worth the full $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
