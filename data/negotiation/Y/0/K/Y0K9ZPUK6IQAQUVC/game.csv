"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,112,500? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. I'm willing to move a bit higher, but $1,112,500 is still a stretch. How about $1,090,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,090,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,095,000.  That's a very small gap now, and I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",1095000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm keen to finalize this deal, $1,095,000 is still a bit below what I need. To meet in the middle, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve a positive outcome. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
