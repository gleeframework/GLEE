"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about we start at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting significantly lower ($8,000) creates a wider bargaining range and leaves room to negotiate upwards, closer to my target price.
* **Justification:** While the $8,000 offer might seem low, I'm providing a reason (""way too high for me"") without revealing my absolute maximum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""How about we start at..."" signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is closer but still exceeds my $12,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice is willing to negotiate, moving from $18,000 to $14,000. There's potential to bring the price down further. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John's offer of $12,000 gives me a strong fallback position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. That's a fair offer, considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $10,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise but staying firmly below my $12,000 limit.
* **Market Reference:** By mentioning the ""current market,"" I'm subtly implying that I have other options or am aware of comparable products at lower prices (even though I haven't explicitly revealed John's offer). 
* **Seeking Compromise:** My tone remains polite and open to further negotiation, aiming to reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not There:** Alice is getting closer at $13,000, but it's still above both my $12,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Final Push:** I need to signal that I'm reaching my limit and John's offer is a serious alternative.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuously countering with small increments might lead to a stalemate. It's time to nudge Alice closer to my price or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering your offer carefully, but honestly, $13,000 is pushing my budget to the absolute limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $11,500.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is my ""final offer"" adds weight and a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** Moving slightly above $11,000 shows flexibility but keeps me below my $12,000 limit. 
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice of John's offer without revealing the exact price.
* **Clear Choice:** This offer aims to bring the negotiation to a head, encouraging Alice to either accept a price close to my target or risk losing the sale."
