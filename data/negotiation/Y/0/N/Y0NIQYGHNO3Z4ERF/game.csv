"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about we start at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. That's a fair offer, considering the current market.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering your offer carefully, but honestly, $13,000 is pushing my budget to the absolute limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $11,500.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
