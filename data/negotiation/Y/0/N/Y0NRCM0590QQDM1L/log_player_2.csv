# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price not only reflects the true worth of the product but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its intrinsic value of $100. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
