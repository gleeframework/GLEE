Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal since the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent price, it's still lower than my ideal price. I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a fair price that allows me to earn more than Bob's initial offer, but still gives him a chance to get the product at a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
