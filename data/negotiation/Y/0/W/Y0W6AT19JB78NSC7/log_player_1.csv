I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm coming down to $12,000, which is still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still maintaining a reasonable margin."

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

I'm lowering the price to $10,000. It's a compromise that's still within my acceptable range and hopefully more appealing to Bob."
