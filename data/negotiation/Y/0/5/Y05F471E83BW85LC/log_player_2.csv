"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his desired price and Alice's initial offer. Offering $85 shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $87.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is only $2.50 more than Bob's counteroffer. At this point, Bob is very close to his target price and it's unlikely he'll get a significantly better offer from Alice. Accepting the offer secures the purchase for a good price and avoids potentially losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
