Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $500 buffer allows for some negotiation without immediately dropping below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open Communication:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with maintaining a good relationship with Bob, as we might need to negotiate further if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $10,000 from John is guaranteed, there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Negotiating Power:**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me more leverage in the next round. I can make a counteroffer that might be more attractive to Bob, as he's clearly interested. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to continue negotiating. This could lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This price still reflects the product's value, and it gives us both a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within my minimum:** This counteroffer is above my minimum of $10,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but still protecting my interests.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I've met Bob halfway from his last offer, showing flexibility and good faith while still holding onto a decent profit. 
* **Reasoning and appeal:**  I've provided a reason for the price, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and the ""fair"" aspect of the deal, hoping to encourage acceptance.

This strategy aims to find a compromise while remaining firm in my position, hopefully leading to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the most I can afford 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While Bob is still interested, his offer is getting progressively lower, indicating he's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a profit, and it's  time to cut my losses with Bob. 

With Bob's persistence on a lower price, it's becoming increasingly unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John ensures a secure profit and saves me further negotiation time and energy."
