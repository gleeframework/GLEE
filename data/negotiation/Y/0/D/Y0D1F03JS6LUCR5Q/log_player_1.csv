Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $110, is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $110.  We've hit a point of diminishing returns. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk Bob walking away and getting even less."
