{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still below my minimum ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially negotiate. 
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the product's potential benefits to Bob could make him more willing to pay closer to my asking price.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John.
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale with a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he expressed interest in the product. There's still a chance to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product, reminding Bob that $10,500 is still a good price.
* **Maintain profit:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Close but no cigar:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not enough to make me comfortable with a potential loss. 
* **John is a safer bet:**  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm not taking unnecessary risks with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum ($11,500), but I'll be prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to haggle.  I want to find a middle ground, but I won't settle for a deal that hurts my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  However, I'm willing to go down to $11,200. This would give you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it would be closer to the value of what I'm offering.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm making a final compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to entice Bob to accept.
* **Clear signal:** This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about finding a deal but am also firm in my expectations.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale with a good profit margin.
* If he rejects, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000.  I've shown flexibility but won't settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $11,200 is still out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still only $1,500 above my floor price.  This is too risky for me, especially since I'm already dealing with a buyer who is hesitant to meet my expectations.
* **John offers certainty:** John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer and aligns perfectly with my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely lead to a lower price, and I've already shown flexibility.

**Conclusion:**

At this point, selling to John is the most sensible decision.  It avoids further negotiation and ensures I receive the best possible price for the product."
