Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's true value. What do you think?

Alice is not budging from the $720,000 - $725,000 range. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option. It saves me the hassle of further negotiation and guarantees I get the product."
