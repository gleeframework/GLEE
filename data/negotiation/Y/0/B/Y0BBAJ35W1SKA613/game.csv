"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? ",115.0,Alice,3,
