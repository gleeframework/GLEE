"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1000000. It's a steal considering its true value.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for less than $1,000,000 from Alice, since it's worth $800,000 to her.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your cost, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:**  $950,000 is still significantly lower than what you'd pay John ($1,200,000), and it's a fair price considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** There's a good chance Alice won't budge much further, and further counteroffers might push her to decline and force you to buy from John at a higher price."
