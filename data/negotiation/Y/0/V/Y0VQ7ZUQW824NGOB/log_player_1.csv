{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $800,000, so this offer is within your acceptable range. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer is below the product's value to Bob, leaving him room to negotiate a price he's happy with. This increases the chances of a successful deal.
* **It shows confidence:** You are not starting at a very low price, indicating you believe in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your cost, I'm willing to pay $900000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal.  You have a strong position:

* **Bob wants the product:**  He's already made a counteroffer, showing his interest. 
* **You have a backup:**  You can always sell to John for $800,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **See if he's willing to go higher:**  You might be able to secure a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Maintain your leverage:**  By rejecting the counteroffer, you signal you're not desperate to sell at a lower price."
