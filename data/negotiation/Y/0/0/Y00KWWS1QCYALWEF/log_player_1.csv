Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. There's always a chance he could lower his offer again, and I don't want to end up selling to John for a lower price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
