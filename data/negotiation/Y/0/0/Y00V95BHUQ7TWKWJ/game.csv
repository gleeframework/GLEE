"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying $2000000.  I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price between $1500000 and $2000000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1700000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1200000. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $1500000. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm open to discussing further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
