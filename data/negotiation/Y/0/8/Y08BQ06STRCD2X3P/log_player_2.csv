# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150, but if you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else for $100. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll reject Alice's offer since I can get the same product from John for cheaper.
