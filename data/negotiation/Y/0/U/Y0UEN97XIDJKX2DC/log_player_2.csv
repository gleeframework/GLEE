"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 might be a little high, $80 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. I'll counter and see if I can get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is low, but $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we split the difference from your last offer and go with $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer.  I can't do $110, but I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $125. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is firm at $125, and it seems unlikely she'll go lower. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $100."
