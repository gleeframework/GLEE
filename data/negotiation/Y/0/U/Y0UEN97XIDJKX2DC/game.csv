"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 might be a little high, $80 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is low, but $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we split the difference from your last offer and go with $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer.  I can't do $110, but I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $125. That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
