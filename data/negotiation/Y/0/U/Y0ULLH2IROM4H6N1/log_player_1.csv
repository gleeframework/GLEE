Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so offering it for that price or lower guarantees a sale, but you can aim higher.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell to John for $120, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $115 gives Bob a potential ""deal"" (saving $5 from his valuation) while still earning you a profit of $5 compared to selling to John. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
