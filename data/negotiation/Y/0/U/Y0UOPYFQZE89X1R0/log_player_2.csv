"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's more beneficial to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's asking price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $100 limit.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and explains that the initial price isn't feasible for me, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $80, I'm aiming to eventually settle somewhere between that and John's $100 offer, maximizing my potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to my budget, it's still more expensive than John's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price of $95, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($80) and her current offer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise but keeps me below my $100 limit.
* **Urgency and Value:**  By saying it ""gets us closer to a deal,"" I'm hinting that time is a factor and this is a good opportunity for her to make a sale. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John for $100 if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit far from breaking even. I'm willing to go a bit higher and sell it to you for $105. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $105 is still above my maximum budget of $100. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go lower given her ""final offer"" statement.  It makes more sense to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $100 price from John."
