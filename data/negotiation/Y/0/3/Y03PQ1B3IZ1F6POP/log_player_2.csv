"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $14,000. This is an opportunity to acquire a product that could potentially save you thousands of dollars compared to its market value. I believe this offer presents a great balance between the value you seek and the cost you're willing to incur. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you wish to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you open the door for potential negotiation and a better deal."
