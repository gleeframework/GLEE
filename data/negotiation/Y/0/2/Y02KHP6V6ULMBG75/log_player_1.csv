{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. While it's not ideal, selling to Bob for $14,000 is better than selling to John for $15,000."
