"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000. Let's compromise at $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and still allows me to recoup a good portion of the value of the product.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original price, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
