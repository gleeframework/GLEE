{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves you some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a low counteroffer. 
* **It's a fair price:** It splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, showing good faith.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter his offer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and push for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $9,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll accept $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also standing firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer of $9,200 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than his initial offer and brings me closer to my goal.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not guaranteed, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and keeps me from having to rely on John, who might not be a guaranteed buyer."
