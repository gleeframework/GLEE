"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,999, which reflects its true value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is way too high. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay anywhere near $11,999."
