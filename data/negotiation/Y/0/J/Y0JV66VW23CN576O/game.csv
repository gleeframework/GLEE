"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the terms of the sale with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $500,000 to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $700,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be open to $600,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about $620,000? I'm trying to make this work, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",620000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go below $630,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",630000.0,Alice,7,
