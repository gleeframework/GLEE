I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm going to try and split the difference with Bob. I'm confident this price is still fair and leaves room for us to agree."

Bob is firm on his offer, and while I'd prefer a bit more, $14,000 is a good price and it's better than selling to John for $10,000. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
