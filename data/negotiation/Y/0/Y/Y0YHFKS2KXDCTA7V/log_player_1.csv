Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119.  It's a steal at this price!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited time"" offer, you add a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $119, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down a little. This leaves you some wiggle room to potentially still meet your minimum price."
