"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $1,000,000. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to make sure the price works for my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or stand firm at her offer.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a decent price."
