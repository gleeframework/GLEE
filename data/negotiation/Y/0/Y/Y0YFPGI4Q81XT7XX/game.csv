"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $1,000,000. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to make sure the price works for my budget.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
