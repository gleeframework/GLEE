,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great price considering what this product can do for you. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  I believe we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a little.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
