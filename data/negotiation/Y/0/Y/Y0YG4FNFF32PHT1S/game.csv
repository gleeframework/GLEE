"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant step away from what I have in mind. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you a considerable return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $900,000 is a more reasonable price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However,  $900,000 undervalues the potential this product offers. Let's settle at $975,000. This recognizes your initial offer while reflecting the true value of what's on the table.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that $975,000 is too high. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'm thinking $850,000 is a more realistic price for the product.",850000.0,Bob,6,
