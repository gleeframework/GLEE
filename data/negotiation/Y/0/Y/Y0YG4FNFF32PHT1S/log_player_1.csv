{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant step away from what I have in mind. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you a considerable return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $900,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving the price down in larger increments than I am.  While $900,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, as long as I stand firm and signal that I have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However,  $900,000 undervalues the potential this product offers. Let's settle at $975,000. This recognizes your initial offer while reflecting the true value of what's on the table."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that $975,000 is too high. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'm thinking $850,000 is a more realistic price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly dropped his offer and is no longer negotiating in good faith. He's aiming for a price far below what I find acceptable. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
