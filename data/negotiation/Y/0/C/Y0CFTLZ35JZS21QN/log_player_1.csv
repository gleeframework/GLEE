Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $150,000 discount from the product's value to him.
    * You make a $150,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there'd be room for counteroffers and further discussion."
