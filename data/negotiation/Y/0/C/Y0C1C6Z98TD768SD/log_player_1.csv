Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to start the conversation at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum, and it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Bob.  It's time to take the sure thing."
