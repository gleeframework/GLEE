"Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to start the conversation at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to make this work.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
