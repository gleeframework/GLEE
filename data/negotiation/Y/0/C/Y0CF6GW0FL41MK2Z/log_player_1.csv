Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
