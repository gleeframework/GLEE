"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential value of this product. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to you is undeniably high. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
