"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than my minimum, leaving some room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive to Bob, as it's still below his perceived value of the product.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll counter his offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This offer is still above Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to my desired price. I believe it's a fair compromise that might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still determined to get a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product. This offer is a midpoint between my last offer and his, showing a genuine effort to find a compromise. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, given his willingness to pay more than John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal. Bob's offer is higher than John's and is close enough to my desired price. I've made a good effort to negotiate and it seems like we've reached a point where further negotiations would likely be unproductive. It's time to close the deal."
