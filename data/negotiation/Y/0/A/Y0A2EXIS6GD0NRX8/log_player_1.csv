Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  We'll see if Bob accepts or counters.  If he counters, we'll adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $900,000, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,000,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise further.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so that's the best course of action."
