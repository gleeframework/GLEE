Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefit it will bring to you.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate for a higher price with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it creates a framework where a lower price (closer to $1,000,000) might seem more reasonable.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""benefit"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. Bob might reject the offer outright, leading you to accept the $1,000,000 from John. However, the potential for a higher payout with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
