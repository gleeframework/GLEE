This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly lower than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,250 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm not interested in going through more negotiation rounds. To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
