"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $9,000. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise. My revised offer is $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $7,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My revised offer is $8,100. It's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made some concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $7,900. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to a point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $8,050. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.",8050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $7,900, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",7900.0,Bob,8,
