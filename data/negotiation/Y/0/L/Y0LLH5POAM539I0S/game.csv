"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit too high.  $105 is the most I can offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll still make a profit on the sale.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $108. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price.  $108 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $102?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $102. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $102 and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,7,
