"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit of a stretch for me. Can you meet me at that price or lower?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $11,000?  This would still be a good price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to be flexible but $8,500 simply doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
