Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I know this is a valuable item and I think it would be a great investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible. Offering it slightly below his $12,000 perceived value might entice him.
* **Urgency:**  By implying the product is a good investment, it might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it at your minimum acceptable price."
