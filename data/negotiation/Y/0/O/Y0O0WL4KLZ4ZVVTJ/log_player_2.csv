"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that the product is worth $120 to Alice, so I'm offering a price that is still slightly above her value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer, but still not ideal.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's still a possibility of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $135. This is still a good deal for me, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. I'm also hoping that Alice will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my upper limit. However, I still believe I can get a better price. There are still rounds left, and I am determined to get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $140. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway. However, it's still within my budget and allows me to potentially save $10 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but I'm concerned that we're running out of time and she might not budge further.  Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and buying from John is still within my budget, it's the more risk-averse option. This will ensure I get the product without risking further negotiation that might result in no deal."
