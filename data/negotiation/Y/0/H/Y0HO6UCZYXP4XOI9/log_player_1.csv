Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than $1,000,000, especially if it's unique or in high demand.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer allows for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to potentially settle at a price higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still a good chance you can negotiate a sale closer to your desired price than your fallback option with John."
