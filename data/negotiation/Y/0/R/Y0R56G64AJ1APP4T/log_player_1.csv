{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $115. This is above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum value ($120), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, emphasizing the product's potential value for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that maximizes my profit while still securing a sale. This starting price allows for potential negotiation, but it also positions me firmly above Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm not willing to settle for $105 yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to compromise a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $110, which is a compromise from my initial offer of $115 but still above Bob's counteroffer of $105.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. I'm also highlighting that I'm willing to compromise, but not at a price that's too far below my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product but that I'm not desperate to settle for his initial price. It creates a new negotiation point where Bob can either accept the offer or make a counteroffer closer to $110. If he rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'm not willing to settle for $108 yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to compromise a bit more. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $110 again. This shows Bob I'm willing to be flexible but also firm on my bottom line. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and the benefit for both of us. I'm also adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept. I'm at my limit on price, and if he rejects this offer, I'll be moving on to sell to John."
