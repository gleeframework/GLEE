"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and close the deal!",110.0,Alice,5,
