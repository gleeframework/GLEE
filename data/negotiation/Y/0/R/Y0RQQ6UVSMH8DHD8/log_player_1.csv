``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price, $120, as the product is worth that much to me. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob, his offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $110. This is a compromise that is still above my minimum price and might be appealing to Bob."
