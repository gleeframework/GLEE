{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, and it sets the stage for further negotiations."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. Bob is willing to continue negotiating to potentially secure a lower price. There's still room for further compromise and Bob wants to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  He's raised his counteroffer from $10,000 to $11,000, indicating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price than Alice's $11,500 offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't settle for a price he considers too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is now within Bob's acceptable range.  He has successfully negotiated a lower price and is willing to accept the deal. It would be risky to continue negotiating and potentially lose the deal, especially since he can buy the product from John for $12,000."
