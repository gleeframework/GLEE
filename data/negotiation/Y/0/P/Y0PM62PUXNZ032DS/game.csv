"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford right now. Would you consider $11,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
