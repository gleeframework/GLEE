"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a more reasonable price. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. This product is really valuable and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I can do $7,000, which I think is a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to get a price that reflects the true value of this product.  $9,000 is my final offer -  it's a great deal for what you're getting.",9000.0,Alice,5,
