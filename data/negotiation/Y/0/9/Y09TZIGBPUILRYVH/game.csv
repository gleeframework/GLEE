"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I'm not able to pay $20,000 for it. I would like to propose a price of $15,000. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
