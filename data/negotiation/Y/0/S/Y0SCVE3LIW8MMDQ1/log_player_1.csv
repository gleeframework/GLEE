Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob might secure a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $9,500 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still offers a potential ""deal"" feeling. This encourages Bob to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired minimum price."
