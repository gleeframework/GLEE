,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher.  How about we split the difference and go with $937,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I understand you're working with a budget, and I want to make this work.  How about $925,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to a deal.  Let's finalize this now.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I've already offered $920,000 and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $925,000, which would be $922,500. Can you consider this offer?",922500.0,Bob,8,
