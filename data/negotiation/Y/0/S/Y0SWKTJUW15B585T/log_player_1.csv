"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while leaving some room for negotiation if he counter-offers.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counter-offer and the remaining rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it yet.  I have 8 rounds left, and I can likely get a better price.  I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to potentially increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price, but not by much. 
* **Maintaining Position:** I'm still above Bob's offer, showing that I'm not desperate to sell immediately. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  By offering a mid-point, I'm inviting Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm still confident that I can get a higher price. By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing my willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential increase from Bob in future rounds. I also need to balance this with the fact that I have 7 rounds left before I have to decide if I want to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. With 6 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate further. I'm confident that Bob's interest in the product will lead him to increase his offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my leverage and showing that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if a satisfactory agreement isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher.  How about we split the difference and go with $937,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to meet in the middle by suggesting a price that's halfway between our current positions.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by suggesting that we ""finalize this deal"".
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the gap with Bob while still securing a price that's closer to my desired outcome. With 5 rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between being firm on my price and reaching an agreement with Bob.  I'm also aware of the option to sell to John, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $920,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not going to settle for it yet. I have 4 rounds left, and I can likely get a slightly better price.  I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to potentially increase his offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my leverage and showing that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if a satisfactory agreement isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I understand you're working with a budget, and I want to make this work.  How about $925,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to a deal.  Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again demonstrating flexibility and willingness to meet in the middle by suggesting a price that's halfway between our current positions. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by suggesting that we ""finalize this now"".
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the gap with Bob while still securing a price that's closer to my desired outcome. With 3 rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between being firm on my price and reaching an agreement with Bob.  I'm also aware of the option to sell to John, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. This offer is likely close enough to Bob's perceived value to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I've already offered $920,000 and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $925,000, which would be $922,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $922,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $922,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price is too high.  $922,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids the potential for a complete breakdown in negotiations.  

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and avoiding the risk of losing out on a deal. While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, it's important to weigh the potential gains against the risks involved in continuing the negotiation."
