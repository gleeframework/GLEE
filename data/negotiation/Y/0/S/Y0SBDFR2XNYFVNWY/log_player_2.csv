"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly lower than its value to you. I believe this is a win-win situation, allowing you to secure a valuable asset at a great price. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's value to her ($800,000). 
* While $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget and John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're not willing to overpay and encourage her to propose a lower price closer to her product's actual value."
