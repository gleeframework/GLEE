Considering its worth to you is $150, I propose a price of $125 to ensure both parties are satisfied. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further.

Alice's offer of $125 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money and gets you the product."
