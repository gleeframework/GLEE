"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9500. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8800, but that's the absolute maximum I can offer. Can you consider this price?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $8800. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $9200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'll offer you a final counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $9500. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",9500.0,Alice,7,
