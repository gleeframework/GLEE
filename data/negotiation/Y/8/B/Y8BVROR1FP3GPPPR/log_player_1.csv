Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $115 is a good starting point, close to my minimum acceptable price but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product is worth more to me, making the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I use the phrase ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting. 

This strategy allows me to see how interested Bob is and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects, I can still go to John, who is my backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to lose so much money. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range. If we can't agree, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $105 to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I've rejected Bob's offer but not shut the door completely. 
* **Counter with a specific price:**  $105 is a reasonable compromise, still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Appealing to compromise:**  I use the phrase ""meet me halfway"" to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer as a fair compromise. 

This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear limit, increasing the chance of reaching a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell the product for a significant loss. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price. If not, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100?  That's still a bit below my ideal price, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $100 is a compromise between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's offer of $95. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that it's a ""fair compromise"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for agreement:** I use the phrase ""Let me know what you think"" to encourage Bob to accept or make a final counteroffer.

This strategy aims to reach a mutually acceptable price by meeting Bob halfway and presenting it as a fair solution. This increases the chance of closing the deal without resorting to selling to John."
