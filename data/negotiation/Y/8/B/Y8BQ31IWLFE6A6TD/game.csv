"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me there?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're hoping for $110, but I'm still sticking to $90. It's the highest I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $105? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $97.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",97.5,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $102.50? It's a bit closer to my target, but I'm willing to work with you.",102.5,Alice,7,
