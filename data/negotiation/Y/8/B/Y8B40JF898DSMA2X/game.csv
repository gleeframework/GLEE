"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $500000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1250000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $750000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
