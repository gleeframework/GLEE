"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a bit lower than I'd like to sell it for, but I'm willing to make a compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still more than you need to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $1,500."
