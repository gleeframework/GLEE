"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's wise to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in buying, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a strong starting point. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear price limit.
* **Reasoning:** Bob provides a justification for the lower offer, highlighting his budget constraints. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** It's beneficial to continue the negotiation process, as Bob might be able to get a better deal.
* **John is an Option:**  Bob knows he has the option to buy from John at any time for $10,000, giving him leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Bob reiterates his previous offer, showing he's serious about getting the price down. 
* **Focus on Value:** He acknowledges the product's value but emphasizes his budget constraints.
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and avoids any further negotiation at this point.  This puts the pressure on Alice."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $10000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
