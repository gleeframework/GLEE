Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more to others. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be informative. If he outright rejects it, we know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, it means he's seriously considering it and we can negotiate further.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. This gives us leverage in negotiations with Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
