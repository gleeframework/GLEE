"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $8800?",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $9200?  This would still give you a good deal and leave some room for negotiation.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8900, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $9050? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",9050.0,Alice,5,
