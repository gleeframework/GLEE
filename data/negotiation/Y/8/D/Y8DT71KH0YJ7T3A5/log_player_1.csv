I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in the high-stakes game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for a potential profit beyond my minimum. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I hope it incentivizes Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is getting too low. I've already compromised enough. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I won't get my initial asking price, at least I'm ensuring a sale for my minimum acceptable value."
