"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's minimum value, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows that he is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer also gives Alice room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm holding out for something closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still below Alice's target but shows good faith. This counteroffer is a compromise, giving Alice room to accept or make a small counteroffer."
