"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for you.  Let's make this deal happen.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $120 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $125. Can you consider $122.50? I think that's a fair compromise.",122.5,Bob,4,
