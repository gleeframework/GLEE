You can definitely get the product for less than $120.  Let's see what Alice will counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can do a bit better than that. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

$125 is still too high. Let's try one more counteroffer before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me, but $125 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's clear Alice is unwilling to go lower than $130, which is still higher than my ideal price. It's better to just buy from John for $150 and avoid further negotiation."
