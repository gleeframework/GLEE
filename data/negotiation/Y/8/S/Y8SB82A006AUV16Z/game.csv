"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I believe you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
