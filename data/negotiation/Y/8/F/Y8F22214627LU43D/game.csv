"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $95. This price is fair and allows me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. Let me know your thoughts.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the product price at $105? This acknowledges the value you place on the product while also allowing us to reach an agreement. I look forward to your consideration.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $98 is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to reach a final agreement at this price.",98.0,Bob,4,
