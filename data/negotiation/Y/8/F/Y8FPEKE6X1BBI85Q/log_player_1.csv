"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my goal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and avoid further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,500. This is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as it's still a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I've already shown flexibility and I believe I can get closer to my desired $10,500.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find common ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows you to make a good purchase. Let's settle this now."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $10,000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but also signals that I won't go much lower. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  There are only 4 rounds left before I can sell to John, and I'm holding out for a higher price. I'll see if I can close the deal with Bob in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $9,900. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and we can both be happy. Let's agree on this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 9900} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,900. It's only $150 away from Bob's offer, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept. It's still a good deal for me, considering my minimum desired price is $15,000. I'm also adding a message that emphasizes the value of the product and the need to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, and we are so close to a deal!  I can't go any higher than $9,800.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,800. We're very close to the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price. $9,800 is a decent price considering my minimum desired price is $15,000.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob and avoid further negotiation."
