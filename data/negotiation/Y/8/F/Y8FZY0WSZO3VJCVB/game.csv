"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  I know you're a shrewd businessman, so I'm confident you'll see the benefit in this deal. However, if you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who's eager to acquire it at a lower price. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
