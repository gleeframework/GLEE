"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
