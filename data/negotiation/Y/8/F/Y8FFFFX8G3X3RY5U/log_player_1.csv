{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a significant amount. We're still well above John's offer, so it's worth pushing a bit further to maximize profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now very close to our desired price, and continuing to push could result in him backing out. Accepting $920,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
