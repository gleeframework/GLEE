"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000.  This offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
