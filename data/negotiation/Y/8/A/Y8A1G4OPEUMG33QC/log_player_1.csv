Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this:

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, which is above my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states I'm willing to negotiate, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  While not a detailed description, I hint at the product's value to make Bob consider it. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy.  If he counteroffers, I'll consider the price and either accept, counteroffer, or walk away.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's $100 offer in mind as my ""safety net."" If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to lower my price, but not by that much.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $100 is my last resort.  I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $120 and my initial $150. This will show I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also that I'm not willing to accept his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $150 to $135, but still leaving room for a potential counteroffer.
* **Mid-Point:**  This price is a midpoint between Bob's $120 and my previous $150,  signaling a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to keep negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, great!  If he counteroffers, I'll have to decide whether to accept, reject and counter, or walk away.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm hoping to secure a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise.  It's very close to my last counteroffer of $135, and it's higher than my minimum value of $100. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  While I could potentially counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might reject and walk away. Accepting his offer ensures I get a reasonable price and finalizes the deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $100, accepting Bob's offer means I'll get $30 more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale of the product for $130."
