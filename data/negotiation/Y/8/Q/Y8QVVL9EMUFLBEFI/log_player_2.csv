"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate lower, and I want to explore that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is still within my budget, but it leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $135 is a good compromise.  It's within my budget, and I'm not sure how much further she'll be willing to go.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product while still saving money."
