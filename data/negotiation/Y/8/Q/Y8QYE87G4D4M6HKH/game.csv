"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $12,000.  I'm confident it's a fair value considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
