"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is far below its value. I could come down to $17,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $10,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10,000 is still quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? That's a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $15,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $11,500? That would be a great spot for us to land.",11500.0,Bob,6,
