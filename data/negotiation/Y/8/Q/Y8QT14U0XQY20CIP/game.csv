"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. It's a fair price that still leaves some room for negotiation, but also reflects the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000. Can we try $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10000. I can offer you a slight adjustment at $11200. It's a small increase, but it's still a good compromise considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make one final concession, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I can offer you a compromise at $11800. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you at this point.",11800.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go above $10000, and I think we've been close enough already. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,8,
