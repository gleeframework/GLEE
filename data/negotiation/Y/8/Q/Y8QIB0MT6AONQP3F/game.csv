"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $925,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a lot of potential for us to reach a deal, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? That's a significant compromise from my original asking price.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I could do $780,000 to make this deal happen.",780000.0,Bob,6,
