"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  $130 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm happy to pay $115, which would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $118.75? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",118.75,Bob,4,
