"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to what I know the product is worth to Bob, but leaving room for negotiation. This way, I maximize my potential profit while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is still a good deal for Bob considering he values the product at $150. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125, which is a compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to Bob for $110 is better than selling to John for $100."
