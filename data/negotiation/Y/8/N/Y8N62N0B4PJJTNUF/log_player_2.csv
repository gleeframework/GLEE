"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate further, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering the value you've expressed for the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice is at her lowest price (which she stated is her minimum), and Bob is saving $200,000 off of John's price. There's little point in trying to negotiate further, as it could risk losing the deal entirely."
