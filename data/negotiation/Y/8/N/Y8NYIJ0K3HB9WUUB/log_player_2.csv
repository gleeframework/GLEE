"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $14,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. Countering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $14,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer can help gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for you to increase your offer incrementally if needed while still staying below your $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $12,500 is still above both your maximum price and John's offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, and you can try to steer her closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $10,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and firm:** This counteroffer clearly states your maximum budget and presents it as your ""final offer"" to encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **Maximum price point:** Offering $10,000 allows you to potentially secure the product at your absolute top price while leaving no room for further negotiation with Alice. 
* **Alternative option:** Presenting your final offer highlights the existence of John's offer. Alice knows that if she rejects this, you have a viable alternative."
