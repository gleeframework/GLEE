It's clear Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price.  He's barely moved from his $825,000 offer, and I'm not confident he'll go much higher.  Selling to John for $800,000 is the safest option at this point.  It's better to take a guaranteed offer than to risk ending up with even less from Bob."
