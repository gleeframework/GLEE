Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $11,000? That's as low as I'm willing to go.

Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that offer."
