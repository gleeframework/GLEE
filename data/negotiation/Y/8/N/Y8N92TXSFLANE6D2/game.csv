"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. This product fits my needs, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,000, the minimum I'm willing to accept?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find some middle ground. Could you do $9,500? That's a price I'm comfortable with.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $11,000? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Alice,5,
