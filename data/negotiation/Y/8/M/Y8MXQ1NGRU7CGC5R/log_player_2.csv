"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  $10,500 is a fair starting point, demonstrating Bob's seriousness without going too low and risking rejection."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work!
