Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,199,999.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Negotiable:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a strong sense of value and urgency.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The slightly below-round number suggests there might be a small amount of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
