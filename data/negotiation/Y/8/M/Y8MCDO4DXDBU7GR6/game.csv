"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product, would you be willing to consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is fair considering you're willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Bob,4,
