"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $18,000 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $7,000 is still quite low, but to show I'm serious, let's try $14,000.  This is practically giving it away!",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I understand it's valuable to you, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
