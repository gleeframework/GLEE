"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. It's a valuable asset that holds significant worth to me, but I believe it would be even more beneficial in your hands. Given its importance to both of us, I propose a fair transaction of $15,000 for the product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the potential it holds for you. I look forward to discussing this further and exploring if this is a match for your needs and interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You are better off rejecting it and either negotiating a lower price with Alice or buying from John for $12,000."
