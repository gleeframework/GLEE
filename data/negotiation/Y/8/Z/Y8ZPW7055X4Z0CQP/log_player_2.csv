"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards your $100 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer considerably lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upward while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Expressing Interest:** Clearly stating interest in the product can encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $70. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $82 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $90 and falls well within your $100 budget. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a slightly better price, but there's also the risk that Alice might not budge much further, or you could reach an impasse. Accepting now guarantees a good price."
