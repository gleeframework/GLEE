"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000.

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $825,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
