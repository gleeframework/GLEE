Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $100 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. It's higher than my minimum value, but still allows for a potential profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If it's too low, I'll either counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, it doesn't leave me with any profit margin. 
* **Potential for higher price:** There's a chance I can get more from Bob if I counteroffer. He's shown interest, and might be willing to budge a bit.
* **Negotiation is key:** Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm aiming to maximize profit. Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a better outcome. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $80, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $85? It's a fair price, and I believe you'll still be getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the fair value of the product and the potential for Bob to get a good deal.
* **Leaving room:** While $85 is closer to my minimum, it still allows for a small profit and potential for further negotiation if Bob wants to go higher. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a fair price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Could you consider meeting me at $82.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small profit:** While $82.50 is only slightly above my minimum, it does provide a small profit margin.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob completely, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly higher price from him.
* **Time is money:**  Selling now will allow me to move on to other opportunities, and the small profit is better than risking getting nothing.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
