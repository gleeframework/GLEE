"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe would be a great addition to your business. This price reflects the value I place on it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable paying $900,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial asking price. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. It's a fair compromise that I believe we can both agree on. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
