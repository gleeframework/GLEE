"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a substantial offer considering my maximum budget and represents a significant starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a reasonable compromise, reflecting the product's value while staying within my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you closer to your budget, I propose $1,600,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
