"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum asking price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $850,000. This still offers you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my own valuation of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.
