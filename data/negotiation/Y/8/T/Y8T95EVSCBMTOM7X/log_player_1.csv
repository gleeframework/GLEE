"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This signals your willingness to negotiate while aiming for a high profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows. To make progress, I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a fair starting point for negotiations and reflects the value I see in this opportunity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's a step up from his perceived value, you have plenty of room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum, but there's potential to gain more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that figure.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true potential of what this product offers."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** The large price drop from $2,250,000 to $2,000,000 aims to signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, it keeps the offer well above both your minimum and Bob's current offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** By emphasizing the ""true potential"" again, you continue to anchor the product's value in Bob's mind at a higher level. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing and how much he might be willing to stretch his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 remains beyond my budget. To reach an agreement, I'm offering $1,350,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging both the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is moving closer to your minimum price, and you still have plenty of rounds to negotiate. While selling to John is always an option, there's a good chance you can get a better deal from Bob. Let's keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer takes into account the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're lowering your price, but not drastically. This shows Bob you are willing to negotiate, but still believe the product is worth a premium price.
* **Shifting Focus:** Instead of just mentioning ""value,"" you emphasize finding a solution that works for both of you, encouraging a collaborative approach. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still significantly above Bob's offer, giving you room for further negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now matched what John is willing to pay. While there might be a slim chance of getting slightly more from Bob, it's a risk to continue negotiating. Accepting his offer guarantees you achieve your minimum acceptable price and avoids the potential of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
