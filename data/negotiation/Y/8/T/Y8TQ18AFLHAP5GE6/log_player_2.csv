"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it allows for a healthy profit margin.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer at a higher price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

You should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You have a better alternative:** John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is significantly cheaper than Alice's offer of $1,250,000. 
* **Maximizing your savings:** Your goal is to save as much money as possible. Buying from John allows you to save $250,000.

While Alice mentions selling to another buyer at a higher price, you have a guaranteed option with John that meets your needs and budget."
