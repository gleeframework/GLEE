Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for a product worth $80 to you."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget of $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, maybe at $80? I believe that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $80 is my minimum acceptable amount, and it's worth closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John."
