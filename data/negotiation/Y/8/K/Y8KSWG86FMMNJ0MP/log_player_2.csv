"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate if she's willing to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  It's risky to buy from John at this point, as Alice might come down to a price that's even more favorable for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying below his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While $10,500 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget and a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
