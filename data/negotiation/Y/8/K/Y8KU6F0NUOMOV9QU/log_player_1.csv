Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 (her product's value to her).
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,000,000.
* **John's Guarantee:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 if Bob refuses.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to get the maximum possible price from Bob without going below her own minimum. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, there's no incentive to offer a price below that to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,495,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I've received significant interest from other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1495000 
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High but Negotiable:** The offer is slightly below Alice's guaranteed price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message implies there are other interested buyers, which might push Bob to consider it more seriously. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate. Alice can then decide if she wants to slightly lower the price or hold firm, knowing she has John as a backup. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might:

* **Reject it outright.**  In which case, Alice sells to John as planned.
* **Counter-offer.** This opens up further negotiation where Alice can assess how much Bob is truly willing to pay."
