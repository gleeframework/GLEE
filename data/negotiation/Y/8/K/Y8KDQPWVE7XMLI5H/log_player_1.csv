Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still finds it a good deal. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **For me:**  I'm getting $2,000 more than my minimum, which is a good profit. 
* **For Bob:** He gets the product for $1,000 less than its value to him, making it a worthwhile purchase.

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still achieving a favorable outcome for me."
