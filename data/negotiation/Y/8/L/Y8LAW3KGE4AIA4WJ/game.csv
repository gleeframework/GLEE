"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 was a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $1025000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make one more offer, and then I'm walking away.
