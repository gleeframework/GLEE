"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $600,000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $650,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
