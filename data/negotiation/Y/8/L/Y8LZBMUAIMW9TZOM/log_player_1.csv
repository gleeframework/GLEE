Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive) while netting you a $40 profit, which is better than selling to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and maximizing your potential earnings."
