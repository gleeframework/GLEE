"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $11,500? That would work much better for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $12,000 even? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Alice,7,
