Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, this is getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $12,000 even? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000.  You've done well negotiating, but there's no point in risking losing the product altogether by pushing Alice further."
