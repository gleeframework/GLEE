"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to strike a deal, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This price reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,500, which would be $10,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
