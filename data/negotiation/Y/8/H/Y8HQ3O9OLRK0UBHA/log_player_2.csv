"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that you won't find elsewhere. I believe it's worth more than $80 to you, considering its quality and benefits. Let's discuss a fair price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob's budget.  It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  Bob has a clear goal of spending no more than $80, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $95 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 80}
