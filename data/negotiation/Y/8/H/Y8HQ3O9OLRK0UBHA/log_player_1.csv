Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $95 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
