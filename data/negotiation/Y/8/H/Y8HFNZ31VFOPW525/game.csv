"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to explore other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
