"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee of a better price, and it risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer saves $500."
