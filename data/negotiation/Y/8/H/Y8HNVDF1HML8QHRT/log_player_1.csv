Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value""  to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive""  might make Bob more inclined to consider it seriously. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If he outright rejects this initial price, you can always adjust downwards, keeping in mind your guaranteed sale to John."
