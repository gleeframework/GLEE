"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiating often involves starting lower than your intended price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives you a better chance of reaching a price closer to your goal. 
* **Polite and Direct:** Being direct about your budget and desired price range shows Alice you're serious while remaining polite.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By suggesting $60, it's likely Alice will counter, giving you the opportunity to negotiate towards a price closer to your $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand $200 might be a bit high for your budget, but $60 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still over your $80 budget. You have room to negotiate further and should try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $130 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 70}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** By increasing your offer to $70, you're showing Alice that you're willing to negotiate and move closer to her price. 
* **Staying Below Budget:** It's important to remain below your $80 limit. This offer keeps you in a good position to potentially reach a compromise without overspending. 
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** This offer encourages Alice to counter again, hopefully bringing the price closer to a point where you both agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $70 is still quite low for me.  I could come down to $110, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $110, which is still significantly above your $80 budget.  It's unlikely she'll come down further. You have a reliable alternative with John at $80, ensuring you get the product without overspending."
