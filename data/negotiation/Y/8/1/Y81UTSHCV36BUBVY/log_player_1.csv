Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John for the minimum $10,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving us some room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal (saving $1,000) while still securing a significant profit for Alice ($4,000 above her minimum).
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small margin for potential counter-offers from Bob, should he want to negotiate further."
