Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? This would allow me to make a fair assessment of the investment without exceeding my financial limits.
