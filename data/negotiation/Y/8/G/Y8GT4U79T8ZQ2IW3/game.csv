"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $950,000? That's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower.  How about $925,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
