"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
