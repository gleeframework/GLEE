{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  This is a fair price considering its unique features.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I leave the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Safety Net:**  Remember, I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum:** While $15,000 is less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** There's a chance I can get a better price by counter-offering.  
* **Negotiation strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to increase his offer further. 

I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $15,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a bit more to reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,500. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I maintain a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still above my minimum, leaving room for Bob to potentially counter-offer again."
