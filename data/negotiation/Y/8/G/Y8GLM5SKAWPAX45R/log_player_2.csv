{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he has a better option with John.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."

```

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  He's offering significantly less than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where there might be room for compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is close to his budget, it's still more than John's offer. He should try to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price, as he's only $1,000 away from his ideal price."

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget.  He's offering a price that's only slightly above John's offer, hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is only slightly lower than John's, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and Bob might end up paying more than John's price. It's best to secure the product for his desired price and avoid the risk of potentially higher costs."
