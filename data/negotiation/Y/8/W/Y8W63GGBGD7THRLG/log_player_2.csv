You can likely get a better price than $100. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $120.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You can still get a better price than $110. Alice is willing to negotiate, so it's worth trying to lower the price further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $105. It's a fair price considering your value of the product is $80 and my maximum is $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with it too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $107.50, which is still a good deal for you considering your maximum is $120. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a better price with further negotiation."
