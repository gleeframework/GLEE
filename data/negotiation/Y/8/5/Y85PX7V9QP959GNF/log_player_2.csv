It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my minimum price of $80. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.5.

Alice is very close to her minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome.  At $80.50, you're getting a decent deal compared to John's offer."
