# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price of $140. Given its value to you, I believe this is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable discount. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $140. While this is a discount, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you can buy the product from John for $150, which is your maximum price."
