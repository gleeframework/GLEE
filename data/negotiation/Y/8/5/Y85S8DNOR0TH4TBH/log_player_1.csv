Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below his maximum value ($95) gives the impression of a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $80, ensuring you won't be left with a loss if Bob declines."
