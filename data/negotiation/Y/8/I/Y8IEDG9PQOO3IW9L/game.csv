"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $14500?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $14500. How about we meet in the middle at $14750? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget concerns.",14750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $14600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $14800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14800.0,Alice,5,
