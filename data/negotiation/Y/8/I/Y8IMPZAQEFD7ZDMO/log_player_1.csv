Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a great asset to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it represents a strong value proposition for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is a price that offers a decent discount to Bob (his perceived value of $1,000,000) while still netting me a significant profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 allows me to take a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed to make a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the discount offered, making the offer more appealing."
