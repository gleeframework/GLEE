""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than John's offer to incentivize him. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""limited-time offer"" is a common negotiation tactic to encourage a quicker decision from Bob. 

By offering the product at $1,400,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Secure a significant profit:** $400,000 more than Bob's valuation.
2. **Potentially close the deal with Bob:** Avoiding the need to go to John."
