"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
Let's start by making a bold move. Offering $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate and hopefully setting the tone for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should keep trying to negotiate a lower price.  While $1,050,000 is a better offer than the initial one, Bob can still potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price point. A counteroffer of $1,025,000 shows a commitment to negotiating but also leaves room for further compromise. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward without alienating Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,025,000.  Since Bob has limited rounds left, it's time to accept the offer and secure the product at a decent price.  Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
