"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire a truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you in the long run. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I've done my research and I believe a fair price for this product would be around $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price, but I need to know you're willing to meet me in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price that reflects the product's potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a fair price would be around $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price, but I need to know you're willing to compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
