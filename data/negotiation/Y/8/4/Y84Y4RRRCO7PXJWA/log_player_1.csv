Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I've done my research and I believe a fair price for this product would be around $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price, but I need to know you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a fair price would be around $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price, but I need to know you're willing to compromise.
