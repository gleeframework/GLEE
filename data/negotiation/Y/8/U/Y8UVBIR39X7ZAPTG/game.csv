"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close!  $10,250 is a tempting offer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,5,
