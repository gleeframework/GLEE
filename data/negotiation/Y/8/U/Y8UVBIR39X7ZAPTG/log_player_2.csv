"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is quite high. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to my budget while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down a bit, but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $10,250?"",
""product_price"": 10250
}
``` 

I'm trying to nudge the price closer to my limit. This offer shows I'm serious about buying but also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting close!  $10,250 is a tempting offer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come up a bit, and I'm willing to meet her in the middle.  $10,500 is a reasonable price, and it's not worth risking losing the deal for the sake of another $500, especially since I can always get it for $10,000 from John."
