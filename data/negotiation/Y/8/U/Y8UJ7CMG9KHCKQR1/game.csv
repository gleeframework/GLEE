"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
