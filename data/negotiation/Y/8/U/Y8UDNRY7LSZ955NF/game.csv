"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product, but also allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it at full value.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
