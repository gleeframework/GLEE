Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The offer of $150 will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he hesitates or tries to negotiate, you have some wiggle room.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This knowledge gives you confidence in your negotiation with Bob."
