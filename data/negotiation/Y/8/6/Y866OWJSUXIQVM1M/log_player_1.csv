I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed to get at least $1,000,000 from John. This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with ensuring a reasonable fallback option."
