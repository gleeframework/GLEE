"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is a good price, as it's lower than what you would pay John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
