"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing the potential benefits for him.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential earnings and keeping the negotiation open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** While I'm open to negotiation, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and aligns with my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to explore if I can do better with Bob in the next round.

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I'm keeping my options open and potentially securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's my final offer. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Finality:**  I'm stating that this is my ""final offer"" to create pressure and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reaffirming the value of the product to justify the price. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still aiming to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and represents a significant profit for me.
* **Risk of Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially resulting in a lost opportunity.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a sale and reduces the risk of not finding a buyer in the allotted time.

While I'd ideally like to reach $15,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still significantly profitable.  This decision minimizes risk and secures a desirable outcome within the time constraints of the negotiation."
