"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
