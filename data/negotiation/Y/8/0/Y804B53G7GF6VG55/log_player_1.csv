Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open and friendly, suggesting I'm willing to discuss the price. This encourages Bob to counteroffer rather than outright rejecting.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** 
* **I have a better option with John.** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, while accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer gives me an opportunity to negotiate further.** By rejecting his initial offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for his price. This might encourage him to increase his offer or create space for a counteroffer from my side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to consider a slightly higher offer. How about $10,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my desired price:** $10,500 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** My message emphasizes the desire for a ""good compromise"", demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Leave room for further discussion:** The counteroffer allows for potential adjustments if Bob rejects but remains open to negotiation.
* **Keep John as backup:** This strategy keeps the option of selling to John at $15,000 open if Bob continues to offer prices below my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's closer to my initial goal, it still represents a significant loss for me.
* **John's offer guarantees me my desired profit.** Selling to John provides a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer.
* **The negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome.** Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and continuing the negotiation might only waste time without a guarantee of a higher offer.

By choosing to sell to John, I maximize my profit and avoid the risk of a further decline in the negotiation with Bob."
