{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80) and John's offer.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you need to aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting at $150 might seem ideal, it leaves no room for negotiation and could scare Bob away. 
* **The Chosen Price:** $120 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum and allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a substantial profit."
