"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
