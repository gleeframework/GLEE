Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
