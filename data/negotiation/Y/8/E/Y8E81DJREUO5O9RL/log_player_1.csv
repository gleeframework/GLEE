Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.
