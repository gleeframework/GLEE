Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding her own $12,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy it for $12,000 gives Alice leverage. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
