"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13,000 is still a bit too high for me though. I'm willing to go to $12,500, which is closer to the middle ground we're both aiming for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
