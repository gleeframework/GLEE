"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price. While $10,500 is closer, I'm still a little hesitant. Could you do $9,500? That would seal the deal for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
