"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to secure a significant discount while still leaving room for potential negotiation. This offer is below Alice's minimum value, but it's a strong starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer, it's still below Bob's maximum budget and higher than Alice's minimum. This indicates there's still room for further negotiation. Bob should continue to try to secure a better price before potentially turning to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a substantial discount.  He's aiming to find a middle ground that's appealing to both parties. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, as it's higher than his previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Accepting at this price would mean a higher cost for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing the middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to meet halfway and could be appealing to Alice. If she rejects this offer, Bob might consider buying from John, as the potential savings from further negotiation may not be worth the risk of running out of time."
