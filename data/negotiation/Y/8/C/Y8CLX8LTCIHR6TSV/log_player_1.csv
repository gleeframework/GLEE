"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic but realistic:** $2,000,000 is a significant amount but still allows for potential concessions if needed. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:** My message conveys my confidence in the product's value while also encouraging Bob to engage. 
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the product's unique qualities and potential benefits to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's interest is encouraging, there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer:**  While $1,500,000 is my floor, I believe I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he's expressed interest.  
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to a price of $1,700,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to recover a substantial portion of my investment."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I emphasize the product's worth and reiterate the benefit to Bob.
* **Reasoning for the price:** I provide a rationale for the counteroffer, making it less arbitrary.
* **Keep negotiations open:**  My message is friendly and inviting further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **""Final offer"" is a tactic:** Bob using the ""final offer"" phrase is a common negotiation tactic, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's true. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already in round 4, and each round diminishes the potential of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  While I would prefer to get a higher price, John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale while also preventing further time wasted on potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
