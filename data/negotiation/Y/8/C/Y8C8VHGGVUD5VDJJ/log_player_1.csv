Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher ($11,500) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a safety net with John ($10,000), so we're not desperate to accept any offer below that. 

By starting at $11,500, we aim for a win-win: Bob gets the product for less than his perceived value, and we secure a profit above our minimum."
