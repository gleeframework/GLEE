# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll come down to $10000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $10,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You have already made several counteroffers, and it seems that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price you are comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures you get the product at your desired price and avoids further negotiation."
