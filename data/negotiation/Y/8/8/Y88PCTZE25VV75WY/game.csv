"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a starting point for discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product holds goes far beyond $800,000. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this offer reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
