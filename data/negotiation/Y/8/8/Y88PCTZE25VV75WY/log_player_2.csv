Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product holds goes far beyond $800,000. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this offer reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before going with John."

Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
