"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's too high.  He can get a better deal from John or try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still too high, and Bob knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
