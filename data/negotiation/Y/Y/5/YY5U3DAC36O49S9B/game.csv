"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. ",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
