"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than John's $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price.  While buying from John is an option, Bob is still trying to maximize his savings, so he'll continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,250 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so he'll reject the offer and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $11,250 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
