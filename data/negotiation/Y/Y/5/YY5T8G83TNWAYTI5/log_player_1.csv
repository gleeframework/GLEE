"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $900,000}

I'm starting with a relatively high price, hoping to get close to the value Bob places on the product ($1,000,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $850,000, hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to try to get closer to the value he places on the product ($1,000,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $875,000}

I'm making a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, trying to find a middle ground that's closer to the value Bob places on the product."
