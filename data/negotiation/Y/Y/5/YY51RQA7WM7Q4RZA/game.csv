"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1000000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise given the value you place on the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
