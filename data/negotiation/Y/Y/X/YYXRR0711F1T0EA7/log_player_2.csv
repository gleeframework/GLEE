"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product for a one-time price of $12,000. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum price of $15,000, so it's beneficial to accept. Even though you could get it for $10,000 from Alice, you're still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John."
