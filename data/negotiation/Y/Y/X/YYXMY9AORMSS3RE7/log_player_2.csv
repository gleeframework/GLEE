"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to own a one-of-a-kind item. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that recognizes the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $750,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.  While it's closer to his ideal price, there's still potential for further negotiation, especially since Alice already rejected a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $825,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down another $25,000. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $875,000 is a significant reduction from the initial offer and closer to his target, it's still above what he wants to pay. He has more negotiating power since Alice has already rejected a lower offer. He can try for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to where I need to be, but $875,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value to both of us and recognizes the progress we've made in our negotiations. Let's reach a deal now."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down another $25,000. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is now lower than the counteroffer Bob made in Round 4, and is very close to his target.  This is a good deal for Bob, and accepting it saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. While Bob could try for a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising the price again is high. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal with a high chance of success."
