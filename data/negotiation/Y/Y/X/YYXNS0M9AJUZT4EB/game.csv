"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1150000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay and still allows me to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1100000 doesn't quite work for me. However, I'm prepared to come down to $1125000. This still leaves a good margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1120000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
