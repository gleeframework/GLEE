{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay and still allows me to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough for me to make a profit, but low enough to be appealing to Bob. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage negotiation and make Bob feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit for me, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,100,000 doesn't quite work for me. However, I'm prepared to come down to $1,125,000. This still leaves a good margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1120000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price and I'm not sure how much more I can push him.  It's time to close the deal."
