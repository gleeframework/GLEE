# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's above Bob's maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept it.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While that's a significant gap from my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Although she lowered the price, it's not yet within Bob's acceptable range.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
