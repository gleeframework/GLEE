Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a significant price that reflects the product's high value. It's also a price point that could be very tempting to Bob, given that it's considerably less than he values the product ($800,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning another interested party, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
