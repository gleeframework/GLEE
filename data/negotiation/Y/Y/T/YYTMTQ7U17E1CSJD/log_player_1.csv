Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this price reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's benefits and ""true value,"" I'm trying to frame the price as justified, even though it's above what Bob might initially want to pay.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage. I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate towards a price that works for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate.  Bob's message suggests he's interested and potentially willing to go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still above it to allow for some compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I acknowledged Bob's counteroffer and am showing willingness to negotiate by decreasing my price. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting $20,000 positions the deal as a fair compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum and John's offer, giving me room to negotiate further or walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $17,500 is above my absolute minimum of $15,000 and a reasonable profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk him walking away.  
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and potential lost opportunities."
