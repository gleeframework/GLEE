"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100, but you can do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or buy the product from John for $100."
