"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,200,000?  It's a fair price that gives us both room to work with.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, showing my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget limitations, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a final offer before I explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still a bit high, but I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of your product. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this level.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000,  I'm still a bit below where I need to be. I'm open to a final compromise â€“  $1,050,000. This would allow me to move forward with the deal while also ensuring a fair price for my product. I'm ready to close this deal at this price. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need for a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I believe this represents a fair value for the product and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
