"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This offer is still very advantageous for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
