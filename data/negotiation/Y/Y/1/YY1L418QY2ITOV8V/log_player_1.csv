"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say $750,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.
