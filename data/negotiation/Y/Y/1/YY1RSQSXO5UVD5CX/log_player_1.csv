Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 Bob's offer is too low, and I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
