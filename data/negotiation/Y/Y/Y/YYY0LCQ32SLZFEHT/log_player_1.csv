Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000 to facilitate the deal. This still reflects the significant value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, and $11,000 is a little too far below my minimum. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think there's room for improvement. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round.  I'm starting to run out of time, so I'll need to be more aggressive with my counteroffers."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $11,000 is still significantly higher than what John is offering, so it's the best option for me at this point."
