"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's a good chance she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value I'm seeing in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is my best price, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price by $100,000, which is a significant concession. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice is firm on her $1,100,000 offer.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within your budget and a good deal compared to buying from John."
