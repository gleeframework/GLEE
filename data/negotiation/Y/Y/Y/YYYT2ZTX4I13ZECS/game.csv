"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, it's worth $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to negotiate. To make this deal attractive for both of us, I propose a price of $100. This allows you to acquire an item that's worth significantly more than what you're paying, while ensuring we receive a fair compensation for our efforts and investment. Let me know if this proposal works for you, or if you have any other suggestions.",100.0,Alice,1,
