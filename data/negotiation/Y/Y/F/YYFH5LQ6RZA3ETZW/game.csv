"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. While $8000 is significantly below what I need to accept, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be open to selling for $12000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a substantial price point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
