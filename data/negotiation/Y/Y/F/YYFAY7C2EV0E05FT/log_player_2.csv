"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000, and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, you can choose either. But given that there's no guarantee of a lower price from Alice in the next round, it's safer to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
