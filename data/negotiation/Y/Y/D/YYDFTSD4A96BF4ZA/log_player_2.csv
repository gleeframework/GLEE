**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $11,500. This means Bob can save $500 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:** If Bob rejects, he has to buy from John for $12,000, which is more than Alice's price."
