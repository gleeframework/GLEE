"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $90 is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a fair compromise, showing you're willing to pay a reasonable price while still trying to save money. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives Alice a chance to reconsider her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is within your budget and a good deal for you.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and you'd end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a good price and move on."
