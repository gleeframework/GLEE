"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
