"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. I think you'll find it's well worth the extra $2,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, I'm still a little ways off at that price.  Would you be willing to do $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go above $9,500. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
