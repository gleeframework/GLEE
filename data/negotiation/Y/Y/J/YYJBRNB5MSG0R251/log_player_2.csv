"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000), it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price. Even if you don't reach your ideal price, you may still secure a better deal than Alice's initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your desired value or at least lower than $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still above the product's worth to Alice. It's a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Motivating Alice:** This price makes it clear you're serious about buying the product but are not willing to overpay. It gives Alice a strong incentive to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

We'll wait for Alice's response to your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above your desired value and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, suggesting further negotiation could lead to a more favorable price for you.
* **John's price is too high:** Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a last resort, as you can potentially get the product for less through negotiation with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Alice again, attempting to get the price lower than $1,250,000.  You might aim for a price closer to $1,000,000 to continue pressuring Alice to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you're willing to move closer to her price but still expect a discount.
* **Motivating Alice:**  This price highlights the potential for both parties to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It puts pressure on Alice to consider lowering her price further.
* **John's price is still too high:** You're still aiming for a price lower than John's offer, which remains a backup option.

**Next Steps:**

We'll wait for Alice's response to your counteroffer. Hopefully, this time she'll accept and you'll be able to secure the product for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Alice has shown a pattern of increasing her offers, making it likely that further negotiation will result in a price even higher than her current offer. 
* **John's Offer is More Predictable:** While John's price is higher, it's a fixed price that guarantees you'll get the product without further negotiation. This eliminates the risk of Alice increasing the price further.
* **Time is a Factor:**  Continuing negotiation could drag the process on and potentially lead to a worse outcome.

**Next Steps:**

You've reached a point where the potential benefits of further negotiation are outweighed by the risks. It's more efficient and predictable to purchase the product from John, even at a higher price."
