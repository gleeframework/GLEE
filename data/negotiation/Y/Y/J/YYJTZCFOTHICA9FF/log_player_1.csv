{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach gives you the best chance to secure a deal at a price that's closer to your desired value, while keeping John's $10,000 offer as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I need to try to negotiate higher, and see if I can push him closer to my desired price. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze more value out of Bob first."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still below my minimum. I'm not ready to give up yet, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can find a compromise that benefits both of us. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering that."
