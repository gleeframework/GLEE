"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still above his budget.  He should proceed to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  I understand you have a budget, but $900000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $950000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's ideal price is still lower, Alice's offer of $950,000 is within his budget and a good compromise.  He's unlikely to get a much better price from Alice, and buying from John at $800,000 is only a slight saving. It's worth accepting the offer to secure the product."
