"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Can you meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12750, which is the maximum I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12750 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet at $13000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, as I'm nearing the point where I'll sell to John instead.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet your minimum, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you at $12800, which is the absolute maximum I can go. Please consider this my final offer.",12800.0,Bob,6,
