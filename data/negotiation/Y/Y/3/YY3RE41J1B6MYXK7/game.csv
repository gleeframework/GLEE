,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  It's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. Can you meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to continuing the conversation, but $145 is still a little below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $150? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
