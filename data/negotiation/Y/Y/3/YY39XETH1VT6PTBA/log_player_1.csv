Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the value of the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It makes the most financial sense to proceed with John."
