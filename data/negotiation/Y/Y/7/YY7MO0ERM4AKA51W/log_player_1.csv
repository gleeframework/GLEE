Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price might entice Bob while still yielding a significant profit.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By mentioning that I have a minimum acceptable price, I subtly imply there might be other interested buyers without explicitly stating it. This could encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, and this starting point allows for some back and forth. 
 
**Important Note:** I am aware that Bob might reject the offer, leading me to sell to John for $15,000. However, it's strategically wiser to aim high initially. A slightly lower price with Bob is a calculated risk to potentially maximize profit."
