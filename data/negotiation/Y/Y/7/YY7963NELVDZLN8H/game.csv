"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but I'm not going below that. I'm confident that the product's value justifies this price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That's a significant jump on my end, showing how serious I am about this purchase.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your seriousness about the purchase, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth every penny of that price. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $920,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $810,000?  That's a substantial increase from my last offer and demonstrates my strong interest in closing this deal.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $810,000. I'm willing to make another concession to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we've both moved a bit on price.  To be completely upfront, my absolute maximum is $800,000.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.  If not, I unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you've reached your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is still a compromise from my original price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to a different buyer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,9,
