Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than the product's value to Bob, but still allows me to make a decent profit. This will encourage Bob to negotiate, and hopefully we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is a good decision. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and represents a good profit.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower offer, or that I might have to sell to John for less.  It's best to secure a good price now."
