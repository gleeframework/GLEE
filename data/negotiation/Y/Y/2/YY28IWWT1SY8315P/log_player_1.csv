Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with an ambitious offer significantly above that.  
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and scarcity without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You might adjust your offer based on Bob's reaction and any further information you gather during your negotiation."
