"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I can offer $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum threshold.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I can offer $125, which is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Alice,5,
