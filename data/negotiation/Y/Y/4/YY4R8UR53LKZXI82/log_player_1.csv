"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can potentially secure a good price while keeping the possibility of further negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I can offer $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $150. While I could accept it and secure a sale, I'm aiming for a higher price. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum threshold."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I can offer $125, which is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below the $150 I could get from John. I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $127.50. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to pay more than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below my target of $150.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal.  I'm going to sell to John for $150, which is my best option at this point."
