{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as your safety net, guaranteeing you $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $119, you maximize your potential profit while still ensuring Bob sees value in the deal. He gets a $1 discount, and you make $19 more than selling to John."
