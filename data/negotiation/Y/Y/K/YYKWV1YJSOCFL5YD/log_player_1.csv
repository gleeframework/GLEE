Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to him and $800,000 to me.  It gives him a good deal while still allowing me to make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $850,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a good profit while giving Bob a better price than my initial offer."
