Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the potential value of the product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
