"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the potential value of the product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which reflects a fair compromise.  This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer to my range, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1600000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
