"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is quite a ways from where I see this product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point reflects the immense potential this product holds for your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This would allow us to both make a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
