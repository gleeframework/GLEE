Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would significantly benefit you. I'm asking for $20,000, and considering its potential value, I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Minimum:** You know John will buy the product for $15,000, ensuring you won't go below that price.
* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start high. Offering the product at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's benefits and ""exclusive opportunity,"" you aim to make the price more palatable to Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob might outright reject $20,000 as it's significantly higher than his perceived value ($8,000).
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate! If Bob counters, you have the leeway to decrease the price (while still staying above your $15,000 minimum)."
