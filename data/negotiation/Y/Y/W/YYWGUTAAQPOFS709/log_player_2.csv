"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

It's not worth it to pay $90 for the product when you can get it for $80 from John.  Let's counteroffer Alice and see if we can get a better price."

``` 
Let's start by offering $75. This is a fair starting point, considering we can get it for $80 elsewhere. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my goal, it's still more than what I can get from John.  I'll counteroffer Alice again."

Since I can get the product from John for $80, let's see if Alice is willing to meet that price. If she rejects, I'll just go with John."
