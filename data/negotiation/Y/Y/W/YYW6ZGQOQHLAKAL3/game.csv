"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about $7,000? That's a fair price and closer to what I had in mind.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $8,250? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
