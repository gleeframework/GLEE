"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still a significant amount over Alice's value of $100.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is halfway between his maximum price of $150 and Alice's minimum price of $100. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.  This counteroffer is likely to be accepted by Alice, but if not, Bob can continue to adjust his offer based on Alice's responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still a bit high. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob is not desperate to buy immediately.  By rejecting the offer and continuing to counteroffer, Bob has a chance to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $122.50 is still too high for me. Let's try $120. That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still within his budget and below her previous counteroffer. This shows Bob is willing to negotiate and is eager to make a deal. It also leaves room for a potential compromise."
