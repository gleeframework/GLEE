Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired value through negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price, especially since John is willing to pay $10,000. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the appeal of this deal.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages further discussion and a potential agreement. 

This counteroffer allows me to move closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that with this counteroffer, I can reach a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and is also a good compromise.  Considering that John is also willing to pay $10,000, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this scenario. This ensures I get a higher price than John's offer while also concluding the negotiation."
