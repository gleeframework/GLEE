"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
