I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for that amount just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is still a significant profit for me while being more reasonable than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
