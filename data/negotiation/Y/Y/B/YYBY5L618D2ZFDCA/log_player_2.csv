"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $950,000 to Alice, which is less than the $1,000,000 you'd pay John.
* **It's within your budget.**  The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you, and Alice's offer is lower than that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
