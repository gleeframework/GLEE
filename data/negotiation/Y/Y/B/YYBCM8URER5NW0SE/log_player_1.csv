Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is a strong starting point, offering a slightly lower price than his maximum valuation leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up or feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Backup Option:** We know we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's a limit to how low we need to go.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still maintaining a good chance of making the sale."
