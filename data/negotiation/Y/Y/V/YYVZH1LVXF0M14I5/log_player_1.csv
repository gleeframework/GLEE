Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $15 markup (12.5%) is a common starting point in negotiations. It's high enough to increase your profit if Bob accepts but not so high that it's likely to scare him off immediately. 
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
