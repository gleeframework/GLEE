"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. It's always advantageous to try and get a lower price, especially since John is offering the same product for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows for a counter-offer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could potentially negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and this is a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $250,000."
