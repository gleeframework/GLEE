"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
