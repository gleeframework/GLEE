"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, your initial offer is quite high. I'm  prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential benefit of the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this is a good starting point.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional and I'm confident it can bring you significant returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a strong offer reflecting the product's inherent worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my financial limitations.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000? This recognizes the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,450,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
