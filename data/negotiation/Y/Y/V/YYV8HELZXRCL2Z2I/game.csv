"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident we can find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being reasonable for you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to reach an agreement.  $1,450,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll go down to $1,550,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, so let's finalize this.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
