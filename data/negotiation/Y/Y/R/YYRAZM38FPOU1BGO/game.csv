"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? ",800000.0,Bob,4,
