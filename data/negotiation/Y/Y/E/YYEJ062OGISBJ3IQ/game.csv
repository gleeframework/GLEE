"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $115? Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $122.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120. Let's see if we can close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
