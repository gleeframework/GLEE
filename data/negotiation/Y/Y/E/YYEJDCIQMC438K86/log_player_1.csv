"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  This message is friendly and aims to build rapport while emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to test the waters and see if Bob is interested in negotiating.  If Bob rejects, I will adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. If negotiations become unproductive, I can always choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm only willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I value negotiating with Bob, I am not willing to accept such a low offer. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer to try and find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still gives you a great value, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've reduced my price from $10,000 to $9,500, which is a significant compromise. 
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's desire for a deal while emphasizing the value of the product at my proposed price. I've also highlighted the compromise I've made, making it seem more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is aimed at finding a middle ground while still ensuring I receive a reasonable price. I've left room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer. If Bob continues to refuse, I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000."
