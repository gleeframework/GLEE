"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  There's a good chance of negotiating a price closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little steep for me. Could you do it for $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for me to come up in price if needed, while still staying well below my $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While Alice came down in price, I know I can get it for $8,000 from John. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter offer brings us closer to a potential deal. It shows Alice I am willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is significantly below her initial offer and closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000, which would be $7,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $7,750.  While that's a decent price, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation potentially failing.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees I get the product at a price within my budget."
