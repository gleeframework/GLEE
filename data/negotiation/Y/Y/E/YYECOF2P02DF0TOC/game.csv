"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little steep for me. Could you do it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000, which would be $7,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",7750.0,Alice,5,
