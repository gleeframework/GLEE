"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $150 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $100.  It's the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to reach an agreement, I am willing to lower the price to $130 for the product.
