"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you reaching out.  While the product seems interesting, $115 is a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more. How about $110?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
