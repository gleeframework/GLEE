"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,380,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1380000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the market, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects its true worth and potential for generating value.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to the lower end of the spectrum. How about we discuss $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Bob,4,
