"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $2,000,000 might have been a bit ambitious, I can't accept $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential value.  I'm open to discussing this further to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. While I can't accept $1,300,000, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I can sense we're getting close. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward soon with the right buyer.  Do we have an agreement?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to finalize a deal, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,450,000 is still slightly above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,425,000. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1425000.0,Bob,8,
