"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its worth to me and the potential savings for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant savings for you compared to your initial offer and puts me closer to my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,060,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to budge below $1,060,000. Bob has already rejected two counteroffers and is nearing his maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept John's offer of $1,000,000.  Continuing negotiations with Alice carries the risk of losing time and potentially not reaching a favorable agreement before the 10 rounds are up."
