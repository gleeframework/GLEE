"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's $12,000, but you can likely do better. Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,800 is a good price and better than John's offer, there is still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to get it for $10,600.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10600} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to demonstrate your seriousness about the purchase while pushing for a price closer to your target. It's a smaller decrease from Alice's offer, showing you are willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that further reductions will be small and the risk of Alice walking away increases.  At this point, accepting the offer of $10,700 gives you a significant savings compared to John's $12,000.  You've secured a good deal with some successful negotiation."
