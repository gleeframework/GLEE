"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to get it for $10,600.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for both of us.",10700.0,Alice,5,
