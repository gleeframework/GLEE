"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as the value to you is $12,000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $13,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $12,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $12,100?  That's my final offer.",12100.0,Bob,6,
