"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $13,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I think I can do better with a counteroffer or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $12,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $12,100?  That's my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $12,100 is very close to my minimum price and a good deal for me, considering that I can also sell to John for $12,000.  It's time to close this deal!"
