"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you. I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the opportunity cost of me going with another seller.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a very fair offer considering the value to me, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price still offers you a good value for the product, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
