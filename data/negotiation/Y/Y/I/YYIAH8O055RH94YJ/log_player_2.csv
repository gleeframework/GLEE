"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you. I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is still too high for your budget. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  You should try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price still offers you a good value for the product, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer. You've successfully negotiated the price down from $1,200,000 to $950,000, which is a significant saving. While you could potentially negotiate further, it's unlikely you'll get much lower, and there's always the risk of Alice walking away or you losing out on the product to John.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and saves you a lot of money compared to your initial budget."
