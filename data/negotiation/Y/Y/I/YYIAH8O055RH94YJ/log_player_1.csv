Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you. I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving me a good profit.
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also highlights the product's value to him. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start high:**  By starting with a high offer, I set the bar for the negotiation.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly without sacrificing too much profit.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in further negotiation.

I'll be ready to counter Bob's offers or accept his counteroffers if necessary, while always keeping the $1,500,000 offer from John as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the opportunity cost of me going with another seller.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,500,000 and my initial offer of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's so far below my expectations.  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've lowered my price to $1,000,000, which is still a good profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** I've maintained a friendly tone while clearly stating that $850,000 is unacceptable. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I've emphasized that the new price still allows Bob to profit, which could make him more receptive.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Show flexibility:** Reducing my price shows willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of my bottom line.
* **Keep the momentum going:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active and prevents a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a very fair offer considering the value to me, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I believe is a fair price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target.

I'll counter Bob's offer again, trying to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.  If the negotiations stall, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price still offers you a good value for the product, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've raised my offer to $950,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).
* **Message:** I emphasize the compromise and the ""win-win"" aspect of the offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept. I avoid being overly aggressive or dismissive of his previous offer. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility and willingness to compromise:**  This demonstrates that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Appeal to Bob's sense of fairness:**  Meeting in the middle often feels fair to both parties.
* **Set a clear deadline:**  By stating that I'm willing to compromise further, I subtly suggest that this might be my final offer. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer, as the negotiation is getting closer to the point where it's no longer beneficial for me to keep negotiating."
