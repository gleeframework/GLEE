Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $500,000 surplus to negotiate over.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob before you have to go with your guaranteed sale.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting this adds a bit of psychological pressure (in a subtle way).
* **Value-Based Language:**  Focus on the ""unique value and potential"" rather than just listing features.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,350,000 lets you capture a significant portion of the potential surplus while still leaving Bob with a good deal (saving him $150,000 on his perceived value). 

**Important Note:**  This is just one potential offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style."
