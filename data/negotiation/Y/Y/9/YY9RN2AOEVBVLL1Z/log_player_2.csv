"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have the potential to save more by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. However, I'm still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the potential savings for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $950,000.  It's still above your ideal price, but at this point, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or Alice walking away is too great. Accepting this offer secures the product for you at a price that's within your budget and saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John."
