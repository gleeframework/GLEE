"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Rejecting the offer is the best strategy.**  You can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.
* **Buying from John is not the best option yet.** While John is selling at your target price, you might be able to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $8,200. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price.** While it's closer to your budget, you're still trying to save as much as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating.** You can try to get a lower price in the next round, potentially closer to your ideal price.
* **Buying from John is not the optimal choice yet.**  You're already close to a deal with Alice, and potentially a better deal can be achieved with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us, as the product is worth that to me. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $8,000. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $8,000.**  
* **You only have 5 rounds left.**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk you won't reach an agreement in time.
* **Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price.** This is the safest option to ensure you get the product within your budget and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
