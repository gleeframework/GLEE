"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $8,200. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us, as the product is worth that to me. Let's close the deal!",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $8,000. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8100.0,Alice,5,
