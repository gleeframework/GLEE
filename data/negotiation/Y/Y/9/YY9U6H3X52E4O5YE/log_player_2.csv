"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if a more favorable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by offering his maximum price, $800,000. This sets a clear boundary and hopefully sparks a negotiation that gets closer to his target price. It's important to remember that Alice values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it is still above Bob's maximum budget. There is still a gap between their desired prices, making it worthwhile to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and reach a price that is more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should increase his counteroffer to $900,000. This shows Alice he's willing to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. It's a halfway point between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer, signaling his desire to reach a deal."
