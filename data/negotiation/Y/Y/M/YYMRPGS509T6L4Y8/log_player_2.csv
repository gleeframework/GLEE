"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $8,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate further and hopefully leads to a price closer to Bob's target of $7,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher than her original offer, but it's still above Bob's target price of $7,500.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a possibility Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if she wants to close the deal within the limited rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to meet in the middle and potentially secure a deal within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, but it's still above his ideal price. There are only 5 rounds left, and Bob is determined to get the best possible deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price before the time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but is still trying to save as much as possible. He is offering a price that is slightly higher than his previous offer, showing willingness to compromise, but is still below Alice's latest offer. With only four rounds left, Bob is trying to gauge if Alice is willing to close the deal at this price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly closer to her initial asking price, and there are only three rounds left.  Bob's goal is to save money, and he has already made significant efforts to negotiate a lower price.  While $9,050 is still cheaper than John's price, it's not a significant enough difference to risk losing the deal completely. With limited time remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate outweighs the potential savings. Purchasing from John ensures Bob gets the product within the allotted rounds, even if it means paying a bit more."
