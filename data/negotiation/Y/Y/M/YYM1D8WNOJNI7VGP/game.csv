"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and allow me to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking I could do a bit better than that. How about $10,200? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my target price than $9,500.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $10,200 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about $9,750? That would be a good middle ground for both of us. I'm very interested in this product, but I have to be careful with my budget.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, but I was thinking I could do a bit better than that. How about $10,000? It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,7,
