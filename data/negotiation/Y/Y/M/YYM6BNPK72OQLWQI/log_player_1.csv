Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a fair price:** While higher than your minimum, it's still within the range of what Bob values the product at.
* **Shows confidence:** It suggests you believe the product is worth the asking price, which might encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you have space to lower the price slightly without feeling like you're giving away too much. 

However, remember that you have the option to walk away and sell to John for $10,000.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $11,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $9,500, it's less than what you'd get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $10,500 is slightly above my budget. Could you consider bringing the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what you would get from John.  It's a fair price for both of you, so accepting his offer is the best option.  There's no reason to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal."
