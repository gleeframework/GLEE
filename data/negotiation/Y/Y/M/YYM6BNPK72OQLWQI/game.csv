"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $11,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $10,500 is slightly above my budget. Could you consider bringing the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
