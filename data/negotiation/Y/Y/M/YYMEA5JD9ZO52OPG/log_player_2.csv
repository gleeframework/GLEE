"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $12,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John at his maximum price."
