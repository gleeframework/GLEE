"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $160? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",145.0,Bob,4,
