"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product and your perspective. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. It's worth countering one more time to see if we can push closer to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $850,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. Would you consider $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $860,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but it's unlikely he'll jump drastically higher than $860,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit significantly above John's standing offer and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation."
