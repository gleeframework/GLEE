"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000 to make this work. Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway on this.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements while ensuring you get a good deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
