Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've set the initial price at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states I'm open to discussing the price, which encourages Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to make this work. Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I've offered a price of $17,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protecting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing my need for a higher price while still expressing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. However, $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements while ensuring you get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've offered a price of $14,000, which is a compromise between Bob's offer of $12,000 and my previous offer of $17,000. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, highlighting that it's a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate my need to meet my minimum requirements while still emphasizing that Bob is getting a good deal.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
