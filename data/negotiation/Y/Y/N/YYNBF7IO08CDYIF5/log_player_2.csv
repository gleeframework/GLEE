"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000 to make this work. Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $17,000 is still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements while ensuring you get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than his maximum of $10,000.  John offers a guaranteed price within his budget, making it the safest and most financially responsible option for Bob."
