"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and say $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is closer to my minimum price. Let me know if that works for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
