"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000. This feels like a fair compromise given our respective valuations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and while I'm intrigued by the product, I believe $10,500 is still out of my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still holding out for a little more. How about $10,250?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
