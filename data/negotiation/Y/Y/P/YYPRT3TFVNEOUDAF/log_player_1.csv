Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim for the highest possible price Bob might accept. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, going too close to $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and discourage him from buying. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest likely profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
