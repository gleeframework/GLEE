"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. Can you consider this?

``` 
At this point, Bob is offering $11,500, which is closer to your minimum acceptable price than John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and further negotiation risks losing him entirely.
