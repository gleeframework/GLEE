I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price of $1,000,000 with John.  This strategy is based on the following logic:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm aiming for a higher profit, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Risk mitigation:** While I'm hoping Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000, I have a guaranteed safety net with John. 

Let's see if Bob is interested in this offer!"
