"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I need to make a profit. I can do $180, which is a bit more than your offer, but still a compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $150?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to sell for $150. I can do $160, which is a bit more than your offer, but still a good compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $160?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $160, which would be $155. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way to $155, but I'm willing to meet you at $157.50. That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",157.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not willing to go up to $157.50. I'm willing to go up to $155, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at $155",155.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it this far, and I'm not willing to sell for $155. I'm willing to meet you at $158, but that's as high as I'll go. It's getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower.",158.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $158. I've already said I'd go up to $155, and I'm not budging from that. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at $155. I'm not willing to pay more than that.",155.0,Bob,10,
