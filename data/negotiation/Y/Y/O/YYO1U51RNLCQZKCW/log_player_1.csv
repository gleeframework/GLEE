"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $1,200,000 is well above your $800,000 floor, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's less than the product's worth to Bob:** This makes the offer appealing to him and encourages him to consider it. 
* **It's a strong opening:** This initial offer shows you're serious about getting a good price, setting the tone for the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a significant price drop from your initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the target price I'd like to achieve. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe there's room for compromise, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise. It's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us. This helps keep the negotiation positive and reinforces the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Clear number:**  I offer a specific price to avoid getting bogged down in further haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still too low. I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly below my desired target.  I believe we can still find a compromise that benefits both of us.  I'll keep pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference once again. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will make us both happy.  Let's reach an agreement on this round, and avoid further delays."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By offering a price that splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Urgency and finality:** The phrase ""Let's reach an agreement on this round"" adds a sense of urgency, subtly implying that I might be less flexible in the future if we don't come to an agreement soon. 
* **Positive language:** I use phrases like ""happy"" and ""fair compromise"" to maintain a positive tone and avoid a confrontational approach.

This counteroffer shows I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable price, while still maintaining my own financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. It's important for me to consider the value of this product to me, as it is worth $800,000 to John. I'm still willing to negotiate further but am starting to feel like a deal with Bob might not be possible. I need to be mindful of the time constraint and consider if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now. I value your time and effort in this negotiation, but honestly, $975,000 simply isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,012,500. This is a very fair compromise and I believe it's the best chance we have to finalize a deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and finality:** I'm again splitting the difference, signaling my willingness to compromise. However, I'm also subtly implying this is my final offer. The phrase ""best chance we have to finalize a deal"" underscores this.
* **Value of time:** I mention valuing Bob's time, hoping to subtly pressure him into accepting a deal rather than prolonging the negotiation.
* **Positive and hopeful:** The tone remains positive and hopeful, emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement.

I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  With limited rounds remaining, I need to make this offer enticing enough for Bob to accept, while also ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $975,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach a deal with Bob. He's firmly stuck at $975,000, and I'm unwilling to accept that price. While I'd prefer to get more than $800,000, selling to John ensures a guaranteed sale and a decent profit. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
