"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm happy to go up to $11,750.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",11750.0,Bob,4,
