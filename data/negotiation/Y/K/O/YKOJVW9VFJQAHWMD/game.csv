"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? I think it's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. Let's try $113.50. It's a small step closer to your offer and a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",113.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $113.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",112.0,Bob,6,
