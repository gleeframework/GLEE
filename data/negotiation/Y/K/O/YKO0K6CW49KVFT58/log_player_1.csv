"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be much closer to $60 for me to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $60 is too low. Let's meet in the middle - how about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still pretty far apart on price. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price point isn't going to work for me.  Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $97.50?"", ""product_price"": 97.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $97.50 is still pushing my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $78, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in very small increments. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than $78 within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer of $100 ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a much lower price if negotiations with Bob stall."
