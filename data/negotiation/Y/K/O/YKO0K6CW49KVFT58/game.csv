"Alice, that starting price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be much closer to $60 for me to consider it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $60 is too low. Let's meet in the middle - how about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still pretty far apart on price. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price point isn't going to work for me.  Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $97.50?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $97.50 is still pushing my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $78, but that's my absolute limit.",78.0,Bob,6,
