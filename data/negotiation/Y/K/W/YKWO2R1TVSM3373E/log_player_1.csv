Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a justified premium.

**Why not higher?**

Going too close to $1,000,000 risks immediate rejection. Bob needs to feel like he's getting a worthwhile deal, even if it's still highly profitable for you."
