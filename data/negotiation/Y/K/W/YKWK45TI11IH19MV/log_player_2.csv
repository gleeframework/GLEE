"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000, which is more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **Alternative:**  Buying from John for $12,000 is still an option, but Bob wants to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. 

**Next steps:** Bob will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you offering the product, Alice. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Get the product for as close to his maximum price ($12,000) as possible.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** A counteroffer at $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows Bob is serious about a deal but is also leaving room for negotiation.
* **Next Steps:**  Alice will decide whether to accept Bob's counteroffer or propose a new one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money, but also get the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,500, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price than John's offer.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $12,000 is still an option, but Alice's offer is a better deal at this point.

**Next steps:** Bob will accept the offer and acquire the product."
