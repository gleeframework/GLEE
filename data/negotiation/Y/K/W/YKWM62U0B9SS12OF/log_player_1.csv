Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn a larger profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob ($150).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $120 provides a safety net, allowing you to confidently price higher with Bob."
