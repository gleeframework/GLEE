"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1800000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1400000, which is $1150000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price you can live with. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
