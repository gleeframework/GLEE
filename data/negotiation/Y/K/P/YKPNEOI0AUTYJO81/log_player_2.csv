"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $100, which is Bob's maximum. 
* **Strategy:** Bob has 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. 

**Next Step:** Bob will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really like the [product name], but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to do $80? "", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Strategy:**  A significant initial counteroffer (20% lower) to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  
* **Risk:** Alice might reject this offer, but it signals that Bob is serious about getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a great deal for a [product name] of this quality. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $90, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Strategy:** Bob can likely still get a better deal. He's already shown willingness to negotiate and Alice is clearly open to it.  

**Next Step:** Bob will counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a little high for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the [product name] and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money while still getting a good deal.
* **Strategy:**  A moderate counteroffer ($5 lower) to show a continued willingness to compromise while maintaining his goal of a lower price.
* **Risk:** Alice might reject this offer, but it's a reasonable compromise and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
