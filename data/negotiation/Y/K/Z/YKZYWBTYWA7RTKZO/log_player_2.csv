"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $90. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm hoping we can find a price we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's initial price ($90). This gives room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and expresses interest in the product while clearly stating my budget limitations. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $60 doesn't mean I won't go higher, but it sets the stage for Alice to counter.  We have plenty of rounds to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower the price to $85.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a little, $85 is still above your $80 maximum. There's room for negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  By rejecting this offer, you're gauging how much Alice is willing to move on the price.  She might be more flexible than she initially let on. 
* **John is an Option:** You can always buy from John for $80 if negotiations stall or Alice won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $85 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving in the right direction. Increasing our offer to $70 shows Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're still significantly below her last offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us understand how much lower Alice is willing to go. It's a good middle ground between her $85 and our previous $60. 
* **Time is a Factor:** While we have rounds left, aiming for a deal sooner allows us to potentially save more if Alice is willing to meet us closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Your Limit:** Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further as you won't get a better deal. 
* **Equal to John's Offer:**  Buying from Alice at $80 is the same price as John's offer.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now ensures you get the product at your target price. There's no guarantee Alice won't change her mind in subsequent rounds."
