# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,250,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,260,000. Considering the value of the product to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise again. I'm proposing a price of $1,290,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a price lower than $1,260,000, but Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,290,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving him $90,000 compared to accepting Alice's latest offer.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of going back and forth indefinitely without reaching a satisfactory price."
