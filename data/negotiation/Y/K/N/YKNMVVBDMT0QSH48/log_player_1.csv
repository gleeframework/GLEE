"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. My price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This sets a good tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping Bob will accept my initial offer. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects it. By starting high, I have more room to adjust the price down during the negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Time constraint:** I have 10 rounds, and selling to John isn't the worst outcome, but I'm not in a rush.

**Next Steps:**

I'll propose a counteroffer in the next round, trying to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower the price to $105. This is still a fair price for the quality of this product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering the price to $105, which is halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($95). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm reinforcing the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal.  This keeps the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I believe this counteroffer is fair and reasonable, and it increases the chances of reaching an agreement. If Bob still rejects, I'll consider a lower price in the next round, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum acceptable price and also the price John is willing to pay. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **No further gain:** There's no potential to earn more than $100.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a failed deal.
* **Time efficiency:** This closes the deal quickly and avoids further rounds.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice as it secures my minimum desired profit and guarantees a successful sale."
