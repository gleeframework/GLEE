Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $90 is better than $95, there's still room for negotiation to reach his target of $85. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it for $87. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $88 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $88 is very close to Bob's desired price of $87.  Considering the limited number of rounds and the availability of John's offer at $100, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice. It allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, while minimizing the risk of further negotiations potentially failing."
