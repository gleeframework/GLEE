Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its significance. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I've framed the message to highlight the value of the product to both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit. This builds trust and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Price:**  I've set the initial price at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This ensures I don't lose money, but it also leaves room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high but justifiable price and framing the message as a collaborative discussion, I aim to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  While I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I have the chance to earn more from Bob if he values the product even higher.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counter-offer, creating an opportunity for us to arrive at a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Build a positive relationship:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, this approach keeps the door open for future collaborations."
