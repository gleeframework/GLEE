"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is below your maximum budget, you can get the product for a better price from John ($100). By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John."
