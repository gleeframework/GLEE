"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is well above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you even more value than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can still try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given the value you've placed on it and my own budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
