"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you even more value than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given the value you've placed on it and my own budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
