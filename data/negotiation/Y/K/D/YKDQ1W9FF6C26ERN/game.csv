"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $10800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11200, which is a significant discount from my original asking price. Let's meet in the middle!",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10900 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $10950 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's worth your investment. Let's seal the deal!",11000.0,Alice,7,
