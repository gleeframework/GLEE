"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has a clear goal to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance he can get the product for less than $1,200,000.
* **Backup Option:** Even if the negotiation with Alice fails, Bob has a fallback option with John.  This gives him leverage to be more aggressive in his counteroffers.

By rejecting the offer, Bob starts the negotiation process, aiming to achieve the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer of $950,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It's a strong starting point for negotiation:

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  $950,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's offer, showing Bob's intent to save money. However, it's not so low that it seems unreasonable or insulting.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** Bob's offer leaves space for negotiation. Alice can accept, counter with a price closer to his offer, or reject and potentially make a counteroffer closer to Bob's range.

This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially secure a favorable deal without immediately resorting to his backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.
* **Leveraging the Backup Option:** By refusing to accept the offer immediately, Bob continues to hold the leverage of buying from John. This provides him with a safety net and strengthens his position in the negotiation. 

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. By continuing to negotiate, he could potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to counter with $1,000,000. Here's why:

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between Alice's last offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's previous counteroffer of $950,000. This signals that Bob is serious about reaching a deal and is willing to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** It's a subtle increase from his last offer, which might encourage Alice to feel like a deal is closer and potentially accept. 
* **Still Saving Money:** This price is still significantly less than what Bob would pay John, making it a better deal for him.

By offering $1,000,000, Bob is trying to find a mutually agreeable price point while still aiming for the best possible deal for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  $1,050,000 is a considerable amount of money saved compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  This is a significant gain for Bob.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and there's a chance further negotiation could be unproductive.  Continuing might result in wasted time and no better outcome.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  By continuing to reject, Bob risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the negotiation.  He might then be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

While Bob might prefer a slightly lower price, the current offer represents a very good deal and minimizes the risk of losing out entirely. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a favorable price."
