Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a premium price of $12,000. I believe in its value and think it could greatly benefit you. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum price.
* **Psychological Pricing:** A higher initial price might make Bob perceive the product as more valuable. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down towards $10,000. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no risk in aiming higher initially."
