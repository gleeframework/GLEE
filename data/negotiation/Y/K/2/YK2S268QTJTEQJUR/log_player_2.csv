"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth at least that much to me. If you're not interested, I'm sure I can find another buyer, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  You can get the product for your maximum price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
