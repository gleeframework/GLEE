"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and we call it a deal at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000 being a fair midpoint. But I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer of $9,000, so I can offer you the product for $8,500. This way, I can still make a decent profit and you'll get a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
