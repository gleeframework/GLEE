Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about budget, but $925,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer.  It's time to close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Alice is very consistently meeting in the middle.  While we could try to push further, there's a risk she'll become less flexible. Accepting at $962,500 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product altogether."
