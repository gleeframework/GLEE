"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is within your budget, there's a chance you could get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to come down a bit.  If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $150."
