Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Offering the product at $10,000 allows for a potential $2,000 profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $10,000,  the message implies I believe in the product's value, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly high. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest in the product."
