"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold opening move that might seem aggressive, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming high to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum.  It shows flexibility while demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  Even though the rounds are ticking by, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is a further concession, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum than Bob's last offer. I want to see if he's willing to compromise a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is getting lower and lower. However, we're now in round 6 and his offer is well below my minimum. There is a high risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option that guarantees I meet my minimum price."
