"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it will be highly valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to reach a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob offers the price I value the product at, there is no room for negotiation upwards. Accepting his offer would lead to zero profit. Since John offers the same price, there is no benefit to engaging in a potentially lengthy negotiation with Bob."
