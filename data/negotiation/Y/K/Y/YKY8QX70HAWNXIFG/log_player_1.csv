Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer represents a significant profit for me, while still being appealing to Bob as he gets the product for a price lower than its value to him. I've left room for negotiation, but I'm confident this starting point will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This allows you a significant saving compared to the product's true value to you, while still letting me achieve a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a fair compromise.  It's significantly more than what I could get from John, and I still achieve a substantial profit.  It's time to close this deal."
