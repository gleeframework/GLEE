Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** The $15,000 offer is significantly higher than his perceived value ($8,000) but leaves you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** You have the safety net of John's offer, so you can confidently negotiate with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
