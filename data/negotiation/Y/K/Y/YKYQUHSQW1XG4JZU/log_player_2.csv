"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. If you decide to pass, I'll be selling it to John for $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice is trying to create a false sense of urgency. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
