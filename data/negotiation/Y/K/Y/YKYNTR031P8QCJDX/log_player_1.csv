Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being competitive.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel the offer is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be enough to seal the deal."
