"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll really value. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and to be fair, I won't accept anything less than $100. How about we split the difference and you get it for $110?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, there's a risk she won't go lower. Accepting the $110 offer guarantees you a savings of $10 compared to buying from John."
