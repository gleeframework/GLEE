"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000 for it, and I believe this price is fair given our mutual goals.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to lower my initial price slightly, and offer you the product for $1,650,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product for you, while also allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This price is a fair compromise and will allow both of us to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for my business, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
