"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product and my minimum requirements. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
