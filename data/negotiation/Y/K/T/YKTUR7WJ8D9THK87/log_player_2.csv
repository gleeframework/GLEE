"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer. While you're not sure what that price will be, it's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your desired price point.  Buying from John is your fallback option, but you should try to get a better deal before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a bold opening counteroffer, but it's based on knowing Alice's minimum value is $1,000,000. By starting low, you create space for negotiation and potentially a faster deal.  While she might reject it, it's a starting point to push the price down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,300,000 is still too high. There's room for further negotiation.  There's a decent chance Alice will come down further, and it's worth trying to get closer to your target price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a reasonable compromise between your initial offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you're willing to meet her halfway while still aiming for a price below her desired selling point. This should keep the negotiations moving forward and potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,400,000, which is getting very close to your maximum price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might get you a better deal, but there's a good chance it won't. It's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating because you risk Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at your maximum price.  Buying from John now secures the product within your budget, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal with Alice."
