"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer that's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the offer in terms of the product's value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Open Communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a last resort.
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum.  I believe I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:**  My counteroffer shows flexibility while staying above my minimum target price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that's fair to both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still above my preferred price.  I'm not desperate to sell and believe further negotiation is possible.
* **Room for Compromise:**  We are getting closer to a deal, and I believe a compromise around $1,100,000 is achievable. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer maintains my leverage and keeps me in control of the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the Gap:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to both of us, framing the offer as beneficial for both parties.
* **Call to Action:** I emphasize the desire to finalize the deal and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000 again, as I did in round 4. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We're currently at a stalemate, with Bob sticking to $1,075,000 and me at $1,125,000.  This indicates we're both close to our limits.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  While selling to John is an option, I'd prefer to get closer to my target price if possible.
* **Final Counteroffer:** I believe one final counteroffer, showing flexibility, could push Bob towards a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you place on the product. It's also a good deal for me, as I'm sure we can both agree. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between our previous offers, which shows my willingness to compromise and demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I highlight the fairness of the price, emphasizing that it benefits both parties.
* **Urgency:** I reiterate my desire to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:** We have only two rounds left, and it's unlikely that Bob will budge further.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale and secures a reasonable profit, even though it's not my ideal price.  There's a high risk of losing the deal entirely if I continue to negotiate. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, the potential for a failed negotiation outweighs the potential gain from further bargaining in this case."
