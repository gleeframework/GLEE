"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $10250? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $10250. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $10150? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10150.0,Alice,5,
