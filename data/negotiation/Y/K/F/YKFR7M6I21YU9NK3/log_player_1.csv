Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's interested in paying a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $8,500. This is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's also a good starting point to see if we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $7,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and allows me to avoid selling to John for only $8,000. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids further negotiations."
