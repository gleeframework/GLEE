{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum value ($15,000) while also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum value and the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $12,000. Would you be able to consider a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for his initial offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $13,500. That's still a significant savings for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $12,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $12,500 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. I need to be careful not to lose out on that opportunity.  I'll counter Bob with a slightly higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still not quite in the range I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  Let's meet in the middle and seal the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I value your product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm unable to meet at $13,000. Could you consider bringing the price down to $12,750? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $12,750 is a good offer, I'm hesitant to go any lower.  I'm concerned that if I continue negotiating with Bob, I might end up with a price that is too far below my minimum value.  John is a guaranteed buyer and will pay $15,000, so it's time to move on and secure a sale with him."
