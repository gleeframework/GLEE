"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $12,000. Would you be able to consider a price closer to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $13,500. That's still a significant savings for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $12,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still not quite in the range I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  Let's meet in the middle and seal the deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I value your product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm unable to meet at $13,000. Could you consider bringing the price down to $12,750? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,6,
