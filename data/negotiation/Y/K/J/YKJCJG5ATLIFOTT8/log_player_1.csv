"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This creates room for negotiation.
* **Strong Message:**  The message is positive and focuses on the opportunity, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for Compromise:** The initial offer is high enough that I can still negotiate down if needed without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000.  Let's start with a price of $850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest in the product.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer is a Safe Backup:**   Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob. I don't need to settle for a drastically low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $1,300,000  is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message re-emphasizes the product's value, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, keeping the negotiation friendly.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  Observe how Bob reacts to this counteroffer.
* **Adjust Strategy:**  If Bob's response is still too low, I might consider moving closer to $1,500,000 or even opting to sell to John to avoid a prolonged negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really limited to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial financial loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still some room to move towards a mutually beneficial price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage to continue the negotiation with Bob without feeling pressured to settle for a low price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price point. I will try to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and allows me to make a reasonable profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $950,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's try $1,200,000. This offer acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but not by too much, signaling a willingness to negotiate without compromising too much on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I emphasize the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. This promotes a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to see the value in the deal.
* **Remaining above Minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, so it's a reasonable compromise. 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I continue with a positive and open tone to encourage further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this offer. 
* **Adapt the Strategy:**  If Bob continues to push for a lower price, I might consider a further compromise or even entertain the idea of selling to John, depending on how close we are to my minimum acceptable price and how many rounds are left."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in your product. Let's make this deal work.

{""message"": ""Bob, I see your genuine interest in the product.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's aim for $1,150,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay under $1,100,000.  Let's try $1,075,000.  It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual need for a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

* **Negotiation Continues:** Despite the narrowing gap, Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price. However, he has shown continued interest and is willing to increase his offer, suggesting that further negotiation is possible.
* **John's Offer Remains a Safety Net:**  Having John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob, knowing that I have a backup option.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I will continue to emphasize the product's value and my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my goal, I need to be able to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.
