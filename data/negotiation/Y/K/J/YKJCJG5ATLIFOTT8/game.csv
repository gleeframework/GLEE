"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000.  Let's start with a price of $850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really limited to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $950,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's try $1,200,000. This offer acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in your product. Let's make this deal work.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your genuine interest in the product.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's aim for $1,150,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's also within your budget range. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay under $1,100,000.  Let's try $1,075,000.  It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual need for a deal. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my goal, I need to be able to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  We're both close to agreeing, and this offer represents a real opportunity for both of us. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,9,
