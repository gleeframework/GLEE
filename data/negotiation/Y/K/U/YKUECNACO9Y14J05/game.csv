"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $812,500. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $790,000, but no more. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $790,000 is a good offer, but I'm just a hair away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer and accept $795,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",795000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your desire to meet your target price, Alice, but $795,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $790,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",790000.0,Bob,8,
