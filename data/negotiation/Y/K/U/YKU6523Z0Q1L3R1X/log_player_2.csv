* You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.
* Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000.
* There's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  This offer is a significant step down from Alice's $950,000 asking price, but it's still above Alice's minimum desired selling price of $800,000. 
* This leaves room for further negotiation while still being a good deal for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high for me.
*  While I could accept and save $100,000 compared to John, there's still potential for a better price. 
*  By rejecting, I can continue to negotiate and potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000.
* It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* Hopefully, this offer is attractive enough for Alice to accept, but if not, I can continue negotiating from this point."
