{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that's close to my maximum budget while still leaving some room for compromise."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit high. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get her down to a price closer to $1,050,000."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has actually gone up from the previous round. This suggests she may be unwilling to budge further. Considering I'm running out of rounds, and I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, I'm going to cut my losses and buy from John."
