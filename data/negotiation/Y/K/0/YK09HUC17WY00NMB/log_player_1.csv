""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a similar deal elsewhere. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring he's incentivized to accept.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for potential counter-offers or adjustments if needed.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy for $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing us to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and the exclusivity of the deal, making the offer more enticing. 

By offering the product at $925,000, we aim for a significant profit margin while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain compared to his perceived value."
