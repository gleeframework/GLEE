{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point for the negotiation. It's important to remember that the goal is to maximize profits, but also to be aware of the value of the product to Bob. By setting a high initial price, Alice signals her commitment to getting a good deal.  She also leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the minimum Alice is willing to accept ($100) and even less than the product's value to Bob ($80). It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $60 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is getting closer to Alice's minimum, it's still below the product's worth to Bob. There's potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob seems motivated to buy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
