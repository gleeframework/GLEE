"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $60 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80?  That's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
