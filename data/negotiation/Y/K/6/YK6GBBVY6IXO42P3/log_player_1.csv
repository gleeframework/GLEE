"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is a bold opening, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I want to see how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I can always come down in subsequent rounds. 

However, I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He clearly values the product enough to make an offer, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. 

This counteroffer is a compromise. I'm acknowledging Bob's lower offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm also considering that the longer the negotiation goes, the more likely it is that Bob might lose interest or find a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000.  This is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, the negotiation has already taken several rounds.  It's risky to keep going as Bob might walk away completely, and I could end up with only $1,000,000 from John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
