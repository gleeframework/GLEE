"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's ample time to see if you can reach a better deal. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is not ideal, as your goal is to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to your target, it's still not within your budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation, as you've already made some progress and have plenty of rounds left. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than what Alice is currently offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but it's still a bit high. You have several rounds left and you have shown Alice that you're willing to negotiate. It's worth rejecting her offer and seeing if you can get her down further. Buying from John would be more expensive at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,075,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both make a final push."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1,070,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to your target price. It's only $10,000 over your last counteroffer, so it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John for a much higher price. You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and you have limited rounds left. Accepting this offer secures the product within your budget and moves the deal forward."
