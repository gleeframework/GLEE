Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $18,000. It's a steal!  I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is better than $12,000, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to see if I can push for a better price.  I'm not yet at a point where I'm ready to settle for the lower amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $16,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to propose $16500 as a compromise. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $16,500 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000.  Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer is a good compromise."
