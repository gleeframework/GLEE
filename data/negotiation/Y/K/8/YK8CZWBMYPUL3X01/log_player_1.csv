"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit closer to $14,000 to make this work.  How about $13,500?  This would still leave a good margin for you, and would help me get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 13500}
