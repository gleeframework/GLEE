"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you've presented is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and presenting your counter-proposal.  However, $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $1,750,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative option with John.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and moves us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in moving towards a deal. To be completely transparent,  $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has reached her bottom line at $1,500,000. This is still more than your maximum budget and significantly more expensive than John's offer. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at a better price."
