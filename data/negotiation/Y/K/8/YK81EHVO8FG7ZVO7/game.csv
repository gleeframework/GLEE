"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it could be incredibly valuable to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $6,000 would be more in line with my budget. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your budget considerations, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a fair deal considering the benefits it offers.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here of lowballing, and frankly, my time is valuable.  $8,500 is my final offer â€“ it's a fair price considering what you're getting.  Let me know if you're serious about making a deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
