"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I believe it's worth more than $800,000. Considering our previous conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
