Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.  

I'll be watching closely to see what Bob's reaction is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for a loss.  

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensures I make a profit.  I'm hopeful Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale. John is offering the same price, and it's guaranteed.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
