"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally beneficial for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.
