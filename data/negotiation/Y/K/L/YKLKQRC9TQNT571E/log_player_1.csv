Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:

I've gone through a few rounds with Bob and it seems like we are not able to agree on a price. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough for me. It's better to sell to John for $8,000 than continue negotiating with Bob and risk him rejecting my offer."
