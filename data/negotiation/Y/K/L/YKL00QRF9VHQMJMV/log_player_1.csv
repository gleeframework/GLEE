Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I believe I can get a better deal with more negotiation, or I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  To show you I'm serious about a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate.  It's a risk, but I believe I can get a higher price with more rounds of negotiation.  If not, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob isn't likely to get me a better price. I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
