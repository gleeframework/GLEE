"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate.
* I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I want to be reasonable and avoid alienating Bob early on. 
* This price also leaves me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower offer. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll have a chance to adjust my offer in the subsequent rounds. 
* If the negotiations don't go my way, I can always turn to John and sell for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $13,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **I have room to negotiate:**  I still have 9 rounds left. It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price before potentially selling to John.
* **Counteroffering is the best option:** I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm reducing my price by $1,500 from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $16,000 is still a good deal. 
* **Maintain leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Stay engaged:** I'm keeping the dialogue open, hoping to reach an agreement with Bob before having to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to improve:** I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a viable option:** If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for my minimum price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter with an offer that is closer to my desired price but still below my minimum. This will keep the negotiations going while maintaining my leverage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm only reducing my offer by $500 from the previous round, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also remaining firm.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us. 
* **Maintain leverage:** The price is still above my minimum, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer.
* **Final push:** With 5 rounds remaining, I need to push for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $15,500. How about $14,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I have 4 rounds left. While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I can still try to push for a higher price with Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I need to maintain leverage and show Bob that I am not desperate to sell at his price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a slightly lower offer, aiming to find a compromise. However, if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my minimum, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, as it is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, aiming to make Bob feel like it's a win-win situation.
* **Clear ultimatum:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Prepared to walk away:** If Bob rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for my minimum price. I have 3 rounds left to reach a deal with Bob, but time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $13,750? I'm willing to meet you at a price that's close to your minimum, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:**  Even though Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $13,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited time remaining:** I only have two rounds left. It's unlikely that I'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob within this limited timeframe.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut my losses and accept the guaranteed offer from John. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further negotiation is too high, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price than my minimum."
