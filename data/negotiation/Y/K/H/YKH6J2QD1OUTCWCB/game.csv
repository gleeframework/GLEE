"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the bidding at $500000. What do you think?",500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $500000 is a bit too high for me at this moment. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700000. This is a great opportunity, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $700000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $650000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm not ready to accept $650000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $675000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $675000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $660000. I believe this is a fair price, considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",660000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $660000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $680000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,7,
