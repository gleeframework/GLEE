Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's only two rounds away from the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price.  It's a better deal for me than Bob's offer, and it's more certain than continuing to negotiate."
