"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in this product.  I'm happy to start the conversation at $2,300,000. I know that's a significant investment, but I believe the product's unique value will  be incredibly beneficial to your business.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. Can we discuss a price that works for both of us?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. What are your thoughts on this?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  I've carefully considered the product's worth and the potential benefits it offers your business. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price around $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
