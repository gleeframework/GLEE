I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob than $100.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120."

I'm going to try to get a slightly higher price from Bob. $115 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not yet at a point where I'd sell to him. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is not willing to go above $110, and while I could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the game, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
