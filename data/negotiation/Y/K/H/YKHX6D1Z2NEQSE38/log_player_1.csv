Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand your position, but the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I need to see some more flexibility from your side. $1,450,000 is the best I can do. If we can make this work, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $1,450,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
