Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $20,000 is a strong starting point considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $16,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good deal. It's a solid profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks him backing out entirely."
