"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $15000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we split the difference at $13500? This would ensure we both get a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
