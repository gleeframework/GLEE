"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Starting with a strong offer ($950,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential concessions while staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Positive tone:**  The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, fostering a collaborative negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's motivated to buy and willing to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price closer to his, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value reinforces my position and provides a rationale for the price.
* **Open for further negotiation:** By not accepting Bob's offer outright, I signal that I'm open to discussing the price further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:** $875,000 is a substantial profit margin above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob has consistently moved closer to my offers, indicating a genuine interest in closing the deal. Accepting this price shows a willingness to compromise for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Avoiding risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or force me to accept a lower offer. This offer secures a very good price without further uncertainty."
