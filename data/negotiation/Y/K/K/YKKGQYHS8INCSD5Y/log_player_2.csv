"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a fantastic opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. While there's a chance I could negotiate further, it's becoming more time-consuming and uncertain.  John offers a guaranteed price within my budget.  It's more efficient and less risky to purchase from John at this point."
