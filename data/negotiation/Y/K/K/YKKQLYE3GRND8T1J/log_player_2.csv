"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price before going with John."
