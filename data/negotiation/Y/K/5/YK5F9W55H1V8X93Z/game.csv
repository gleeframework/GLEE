,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this is a great deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $8,800 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to go up in price, and I appreciate that. However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us and would help us close this transaction. Let's work together to make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,7,
