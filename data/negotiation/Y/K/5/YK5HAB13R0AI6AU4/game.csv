"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1000000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
