"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start the conversation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk by offering a lower price.  He's hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of them.  The $13,000 offer is still within his budget and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects. This strategy balances saving money while keeping the deal open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, and for understanding the value this product brings. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,750 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above the product's value to Alice. Bob can try to push for a lower price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.  He's still early in the negotiation process and has several rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a little too high at $13,750.  Would you consider $13,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also acknowledging Alice's concessions.  By offering $13,500, Bob is showing he's willing to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a firm position on price."
