Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product's value. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential within my business.

Bob's offer:
