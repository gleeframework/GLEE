,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $14,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,500? I believe this would still allow us to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to strike a deal, $9,500 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $12,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure a fair return.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my current financial situation, I can't commit to $12,000. Would it be possible for you to consider $10,000? This might help us bridge the gap between our values.",10000.0,Bob,4,
