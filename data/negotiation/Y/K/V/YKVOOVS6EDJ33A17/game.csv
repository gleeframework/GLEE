"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's make this happen.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,250 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,5,
