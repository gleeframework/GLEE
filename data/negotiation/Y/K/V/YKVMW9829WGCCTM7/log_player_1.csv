Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know John will buy the product for $100 as a last resort, I want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** Offering the product at $150 gives Bob a chance to consider its value while leaving room for potential negotiation. 

This strategy aims to balance the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher sale price."
