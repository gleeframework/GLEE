"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my target. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down, $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm going to keep negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but  $1,050,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go to $900,000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price point for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my target. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'll also throw in a small concession: I'll cover 50% of the closing costs. This should sweeten the deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging from her $1,050,000 price, even with the concession. I've already offered my maximum and I'm running out of time. It's better for me to buy the product from John at $800,000 and save $250,000."
