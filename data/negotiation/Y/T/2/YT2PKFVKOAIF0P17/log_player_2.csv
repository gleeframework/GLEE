"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to her $1,200,000 valuation."
