**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Bob's value:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay. It's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, even at the higher price. This ensures he gets the product while staying within his budget."
