"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? This is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
