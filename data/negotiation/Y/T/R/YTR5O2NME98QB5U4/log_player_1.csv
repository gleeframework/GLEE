{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm being polite and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob.

This strategy aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while maintaining a positive tone."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my last offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I emphasize that $90 is a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive language (""happy to work with you"") to keep the negotiation friendly. 

This counteroffer is aimed at closing the deal quickly while still maximizing my potential earnings."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $85, so how about $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $87.50 is only $2.50 away from my minimum acceptable price of $85, and I'm concerned that I'm running out of time to close the deal. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $90, I believe accepting this offer is the best option to secure a sale and maximize my earnings given the remaining rounds."
