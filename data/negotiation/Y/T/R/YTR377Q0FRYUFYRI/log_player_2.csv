# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than buying from John for $15,000.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, it's still a good deal and saves you $3,000."
