Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You still make a profit, even if Bob rejects the offer. 

Let me know if you want to try a different price or message!"
