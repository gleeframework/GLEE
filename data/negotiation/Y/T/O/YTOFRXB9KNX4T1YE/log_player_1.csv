Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I want to see if I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to buy the product, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might walk away entirely.  It's also likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price for me.  $16,000 is a good enough deal."
