Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum price ($10,000). It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation. It also highlights the potential value of the product and emphasizes my openness to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a high price and see how Bob responds.  I can then adjust my offers based on his reactions. If he rejects my initial offer, I will then evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. I will always have the option to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I never lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still above my minimum price of $10,000, but it's below my desired price of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial ask. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap.  I am not yet ready to accept his price, but I also don't want to lose out on the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  It's a fair price for a product that will undoubtedly bring you great value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $13,500, which is halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to achieve a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but reiterating my desire for a slightly higher price. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

By presenting a counteroffer that is a compromise, I aim to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while also keeping my profits higher than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? That way, we can both feel comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is just $500 below my initial counteroffer of $13,500.  It's a good price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's important to note that while I could try to push for a higher price, there is a risk that Bob will walk away, and I would only be able to sell to John for $10,000. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a deal at a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal entirely.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
