Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is important, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.
