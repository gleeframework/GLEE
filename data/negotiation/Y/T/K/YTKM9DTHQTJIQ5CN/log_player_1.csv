While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $980,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a considerable profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now ensures I get paid sooner.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** The use of ""final price"" suggests Bob is unlikely to go higher. 

Accepting this offer secures a good deal while minimizing potential risks."
