Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price to make this worthwhile.  How about $900,000?  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000.  How about we meet at $850,000?  That's a good compromise, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $800,000.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate when you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John."
