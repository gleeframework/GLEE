Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price to make this worthwhile.  How about $900,000?  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
