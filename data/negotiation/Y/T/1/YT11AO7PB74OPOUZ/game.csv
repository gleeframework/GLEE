"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I can't go below $8,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
