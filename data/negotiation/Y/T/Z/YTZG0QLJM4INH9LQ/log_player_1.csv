Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value greatly. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming above Bob's perceived value increases your potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $1,500,000 offer isn't outrageously high, leaving room for Bob to negotiate down. This creates a more realistic negotiation scenario.
* **Confident but not pushy:** The message is positive and acknowledges Bob's interest while firmly stating your price.  

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the potential deal."
