"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be very valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and potential benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $18,000 is significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000, leaving space for concessions if needed.
* **Building Dialogue:** The message invites Bob to respond, opening the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:**  Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum.  It's too low to be profitable and doesn't reflect any potential value he might see.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. While I wouldn't accept $12,000, I could potentially meet him somewhere in the middle.
* **Test the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge his seriousness and determine if he's willing to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a win-win situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer but still ensuring a profit for myself.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price, implying that both parties are getting a good deal.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Clear Next Step:** The counteroffer provides a specific price point, making it clear what I'm looking for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000.  This deal secures a profit and is a good outcome.
* **Limited Negotiation:** We've gone through several rounds, and Bob's offers have shown he's willing to pay closer to my initial price. Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Factor:** It's important to remember that I have a limited number of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a good outcome without risking further negotiation. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I can close the deal and secure a profit without the risk of having to accept John's lower offer or continue negotiating with Bob."
