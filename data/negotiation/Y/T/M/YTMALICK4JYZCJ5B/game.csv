"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",85.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to come down to $75.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",75.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $72.50? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",72.5,Bob,6,
