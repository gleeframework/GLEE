"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1280000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1240000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1240000.0,Alice,5,
