"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its true value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is closer, but still a little too high for my budget. How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
