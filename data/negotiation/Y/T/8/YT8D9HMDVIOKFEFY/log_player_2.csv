# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its true value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

Alice is unlikely to go below $795,000 and John offers the product for $800,000. It's better to secure the deal with John at this point rather than risk Alice not budging further."
