"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product.  I'm confident it can be a real asset to you. I'm asking for $2,300,000 to start negotiations. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and getting us closer to a deal. However,  $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position on the value, but I need us to find some middle ground.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but $1,000,000 is just too far below the product's true value. If we could settle somewhere between $1,600,000 and $1,700,000, I'd be happy to close the deal today. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I value your interest and want to see this product benefit your business.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
