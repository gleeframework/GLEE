Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product.  I'm confident it can be a real asset to you. I'm asking for $2,300,000 to start negotiations. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and getting us closer to a deal. However,  $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position on the value, but I need us to find some middle ground.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but $1,000,000 is just too far below the product's true value. If we could settle somewhere between $1,600,000 and $1,700,000, I'd be happy to close the deal today. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I value your interest and want to see this product benefit your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while you could potentially negotiate a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of losing the $1,000,000 deal with John. You've reached your maximum budget, so it's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product from John."
