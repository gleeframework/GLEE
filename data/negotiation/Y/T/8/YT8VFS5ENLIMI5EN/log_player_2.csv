"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $1,100,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a truly unique item, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can do better than $1,100,000. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  It's a fair value for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, which is still a great value for the product. It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You're very close to your budget and John is offering the product at your target price. It's more efficient to simply buy from John and finalize the deal."
