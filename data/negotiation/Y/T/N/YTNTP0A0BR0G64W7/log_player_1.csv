Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
We're still significantly far apart in our valuations. While $900,000 is a good chunk of money, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob before accepting a price that far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about we settle on $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

We are getting closer, but I'm still losing a significant amount compared to John's offer. I'll push Bob a bit further, but I need to be prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to see a more significant move on your end to justify letting go of this product for less than its true worth. How about $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. In light of our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}

Bob is not moving significantly towards my valuation, and I'm now at a point where continuing the negotiation risks losing more money than I'm comfortable with. John's offer guarantees my minimum acceptable price, so it makes the most sense to proceed with that deal."
