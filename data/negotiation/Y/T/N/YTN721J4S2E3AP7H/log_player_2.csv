"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John and save a considerable amount."
