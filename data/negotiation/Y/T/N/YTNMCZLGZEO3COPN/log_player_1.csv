"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100 to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Space for Counteroffer:**  A price of $120 leaves enough space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Message:** The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a good note. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $100, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept right now. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price that's mutually beneficial. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have the option of selling to John for $100, so I don't feel pressured to accept a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** My message emphasizes a collaborative approach, suggesting a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob that this is still a ""great deal"" for him, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiations if Bob needs more convincing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and your previous offer of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $97.5 is closer to my desired price point, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm confident we can reach a better price, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. 
* **Safety Net with John:** Having John as a backup option allows me to be firm in my decision and not feel pressured to accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $97.5 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $102.5. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $102.5 is a compromise, exactly halfway between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's current offer of $97.5. This shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""fair price for both of us,"" emphasizing the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This offer still allows me to earn a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Positive Tone:** The message uses a positive and conversational tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:** I'm still open to further negotiation if Bob needs more convincing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's getting close to what I'm willing to pay, but I'd like to try to save a bit more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum acceptable price point, but it doesn't leave me any room for profit. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a higher price with Bob is uncertain, and I don't want to risk losing a potential sale.
* **John is a Secure Option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price of $100, guaranteeing me a sale and avoiding any further negotiation risks.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of not closing the deal with either of them is too high."
