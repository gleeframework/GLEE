"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. ",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and your previous offer of $105?,97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $97.5 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $102.5. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,

"I'm still not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's getting close to what I'm willing to pay, but I'd like to try to save a bit more.",100.0,Bob,6,
