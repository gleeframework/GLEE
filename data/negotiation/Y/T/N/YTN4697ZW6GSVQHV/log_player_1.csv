Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$90 is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm countering with $120. This is my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob wants the product, he'll have to come up at least to this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still too low.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to come up to my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
