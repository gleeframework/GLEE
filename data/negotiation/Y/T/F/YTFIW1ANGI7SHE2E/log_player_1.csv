I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I want to maximize my earnings, and there's a chance Bob values the product even more than $1,500,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:** While there's a risk Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not losing money.

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to secure a sale."
