Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $70. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $85 gets a better price than John's $100 offer."
