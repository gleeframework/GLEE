"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial price is $1,250,000, a significant discount from its worth to you.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also willing to sell to another buyer for $1,000,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for this product. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
