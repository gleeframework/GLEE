Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial price is $1,250,000, a significant discount from its worth to you.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also willing to sell to another buyer for $1,000,000 if we can't come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. It's better to try and negotiate with him further than to settle for that price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for this product. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
