"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. While I value your interest,  $800000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the value it brings and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's continue discussing to find a solution that works for both parties.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to meet halfway. However, $950000 still falls short of the true value of this product, considering its unique benefits and potential. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm offering a final price of $1050000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both understand this product holds.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $975000. I think this is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit from this investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about the value I'll get from the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
