Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving him room to negotiate. However, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), ensuring I profit even if he rejects the offer. This strategy balances maximizing my earnings with securing a sale, as I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John."
