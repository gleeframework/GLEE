Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price with John, but it gives me the potential to earn a much larger profit. 

Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob values it at $2,000,000 or more, he'll accept. If he values it lower, he'll reject, and I'll still get my minimum price from John."
