"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, trying to push Alice towards his desired price range. However, the offer is not unreasonable, as it's still higher than Bob's alternative price from John. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting the initial offer, Bob has established leverage. He's signaled that he's serious about negotiating and won't settle for the first price.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The counteroffer leaves room for both parties to negotiate. Bob can potentially increase his offer slightly, while Alice might need to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:**  Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, but it's still above Bob's ideal price.
* **Negotiation Window:**  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price closer to his desired $1,000,000.
* **Value for Money:** Bob is willing to buy from John for $1,000,000, so he shouldn't accept anything significantly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still looking to stay within my budget, so I'm offering $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is putting his cards on the table. This is his absolute limit, and he's not willing to go higher. This creates pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  Bob is reminding Alice that he has a backup option and isn't desperate for this deal.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer is a good test to see if Alice is willing to close the deal at the lower price. If she rejects, it's likely that Bob will need to move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go any lower than $1100000.  This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:**  Alice is sticking to her price, which is higher than Bob's maximum budget. 
* **No Room for Compromise:**  Alice's statement that this is her final offer and she'll move on to another buyer signals that further negotiation is unlikely to be successful.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Bob has a reliable alternative with John, who is willing to sell at Bob's desired price.  There's no point in risking losing the deal with John by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
