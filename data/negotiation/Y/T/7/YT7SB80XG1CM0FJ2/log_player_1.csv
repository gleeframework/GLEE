"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,100,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport and create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick close but am prepared to negotiate if needed. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $950000. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below his own perceived value of the product. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and close the deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a smaller reduction:** I'm lowering my price by $50,000, showing flexibility but not giving away too much. 
* **Focus on value again:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm setting a clear bottom line. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway while still securing a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still looking to stay within my budget, so I'm offering $1000000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount of $1,200,000. Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and move to sell to John.  There's not enough time left in the negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go any lower than $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this my final offer, indicating that I'm serious about this price. 
* **Highlighting the Minimum:** I'm emphasizing the $1,100,000 price as my minimum, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Mentioning Another Buyer:**  I'm subtly mentioning that I have alternative buyers, making Bob feel urgency.

**Strategy:**

This is a high-pressure tactic to get Bob to accept my price. I'm hoping that he'll be willing to compromise to avoid losing the deal altogether. If he doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John."
