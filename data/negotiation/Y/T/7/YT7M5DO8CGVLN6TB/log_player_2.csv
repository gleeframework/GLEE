"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the maximum I'm willing to pay. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the profit I can make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay at this time."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. However, considering that I only have a few rounds left and John is offering the product at $1,000,000, it's wise to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a slightly higher price. Further negotiation may not be fruitful and could risk losing the deal."
