Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its many features and benefits, I'm offering it at $22,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This price would still be profitable for you and allows me to acquire the product within my means. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and the fact that you would still be making a profit. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and  is unlikely to move significantly higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
