"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I've set the price at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time opportunity, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency:** Introducing a mild sense of urgency encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously from the start. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while leaving options open for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value and my initial asking price.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your perspective."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving to the midpoint between our previous offers. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's unique value, justifying the higher price point.
* **Clear Objective:** Offering a specific number ($1,300,000) provides a concrete point for Bob to consider and potentially accept.

I'm hoping this counteroffer encourages Bob to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now shown a willingness to move closer to my price range, and his latest offer of $1,250,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000). While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or become less willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
