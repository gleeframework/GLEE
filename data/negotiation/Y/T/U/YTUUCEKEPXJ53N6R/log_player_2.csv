"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and I'm excited to see it in your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $12,000 is a little too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,000:** This is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and significantly closer to his desired price of $12,000.
* **Counter-offering again is risky:**  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or further delaying the purchase.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  At $15,000, John's price is higher than Alice's current offer.

Accepting Alice's offer at $13,000 represents a good compromise, saving Bob money and securing the product."
