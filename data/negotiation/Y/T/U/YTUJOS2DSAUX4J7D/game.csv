"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $500,000 to start.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $500,000 is significantly below market value for a product of this caliber.  Let's find a more realistic middle ground. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that $1,900,000 is a substantial move, and I appreciate you coming up from your initial offer. To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair reflection of its value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on. How about we settle in the middle at $1,150,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while recognizing the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer willing to offer me $1,500,000.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
