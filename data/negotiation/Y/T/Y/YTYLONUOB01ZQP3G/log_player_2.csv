Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is now at $1,080,000.  This is still within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  There's a chance Bob could get a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
