"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my minimum price and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would still allow you a good profit margin and is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no more. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000. It shows you're serious about acquiring the product.  However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. To make this work, I'd need to see a price of $11,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than its true value. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $10,250. That's my final offer. If you can accept that, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",10250.0,Bob,6,
