"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
