It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $7,500 is a good price, considering I can buy it for $10,000 from John. It's worth accepting this offer to save $2,500."
