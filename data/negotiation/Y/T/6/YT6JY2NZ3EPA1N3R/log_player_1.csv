"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is too far below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle on $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price closer to $1 million, and rejecting this offer might encourage him to move closer to that mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. It's of significant value, and I believe $1,025,000 is a very reasonable compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see the value in the product, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we split the difference and agree on $987,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to our million-dollar threshold. While we could push for a bit more, accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling. It's better to secure a great deal now than potentially miss out on a good price."
