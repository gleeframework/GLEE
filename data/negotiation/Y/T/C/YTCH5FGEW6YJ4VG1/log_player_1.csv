Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,199,999. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer reflects my desire for a mutually beneficial transaction."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to extract as much profit from Bob as possible.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($1,199,999) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to end up with a better deal than your alternative.
* **Justification:** Framing the price as reflecting a ""mutually beneficial transaction"" might make Bob more receptive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This assumes you have limited information about Bob's negotiating style. If you knew he was highly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure, a more aggressive initial offer could be advantageous."
