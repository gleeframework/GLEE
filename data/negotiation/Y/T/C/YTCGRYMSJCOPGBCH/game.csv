"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its value. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, but I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a significant investment. Could we try for $700,000?  I think that would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. How about we meet at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you're trying to maximize your value, and I'm trying to make this work within my budget. How about we split the difference and land at $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I've already made some significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to the table.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
