"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
