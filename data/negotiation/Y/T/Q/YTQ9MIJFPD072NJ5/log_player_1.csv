Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we consider $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? I'm confident we can finalize a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, it's still below my absolute minimum ($1,500,000).  I have a guaranteed offer from John at that minimum, so it makes the most financial sense to proceed with selling to John."
