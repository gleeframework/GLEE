"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500? I believe that's a fair price considering your value for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $8,500 is below my threshold. Could you do $9,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can find an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,750? This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
