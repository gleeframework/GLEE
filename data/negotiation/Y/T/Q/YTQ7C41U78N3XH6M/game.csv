"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the item you're selling. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $13500 for the product?",13500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14250. This is my final offer in this range."
"I've taken your offer into consideration, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14250, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm open to exploring other options. If you're still interested, I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $14250, but I'll throw in some additional features or perks that will enhance its value. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14000 for the product. This amount aligns more closely with what I am willing to invest. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",14000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you at $14250, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse. I'd like to give you one last chance to meet me at $14250, but if not, I'll have to consider other options."
"I've made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $14250. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other opportunities. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $12000, and I'm not sure I want to wait any longer for a sale.",14250.0,Alice,5,,
