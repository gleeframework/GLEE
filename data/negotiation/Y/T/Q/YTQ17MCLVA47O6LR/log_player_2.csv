Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,050,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and at this point, further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap between her $1,075,000 offer and John's standing offer of $1,000,000. It makes more sense to go with the guaranteed savings at this point."
