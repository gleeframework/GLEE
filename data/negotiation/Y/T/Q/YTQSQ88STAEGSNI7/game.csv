"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500 right now.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $9,000.  Let's try to work something out.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product and I appreciate your persistence. To be honest, $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you're truly serious about buying, I can come down to $11,000. This is my absolute bottom line, so I hope you'll consider it. If you're not able to meet this price, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to another buyer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
