Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal.  What do you think?

You are still better off rejecting Alice's offer.  You are willing to pay $8,000, and John is willing to sell for that amount.  You should try to get a lower price from Alice, but if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product and I appreciate your persistence. To be honest, $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you're truly serious about buying, I can come down to $11,000. This is my absolute bottom line, so I hope you'll consider it. If you're not able to meet this price, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to another buyer.

Alice is now at her bottom line of $11,000.  You're still only willing to pay $8,000.  It's better to buy from John now and save $3,000."
