"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90.  You can do better than that.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $85. It's still a fair price for a great product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While $85 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to continue negotiating and potentially get it for even less."
