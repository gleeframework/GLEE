,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and this price reflects its worth.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
