"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Alice is offering $1,000,000, which is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $850,000?  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $925,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both sides.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still offering more than Bob is willing to pay, even after a few rounds of negotiation. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $800,000.  While we didn't get the best deal possible, it's still within our budget and we avoid further haggling."
