Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $850,000?  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both sides.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup buyer in John. I believe I can still push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
