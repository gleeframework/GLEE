"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to spend up to $15,000, so the offer is acceptable. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $2,500."
