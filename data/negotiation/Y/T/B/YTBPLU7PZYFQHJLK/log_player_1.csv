Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to be negotiated. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John, giving you a negotiating advantage.

**Strategic Offering**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might make him suspicious or unwilling to negotiate. 

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and the offer as exclusive.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,400,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount, making it an attractive proposition. It also secures you a $200,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might lower the price slightly or be prepared to negotiate further. 
* **Relationship Building:** Even in a negotiation, maintaining a positive relationship is important.  Be professional and respectful throughout the process."
