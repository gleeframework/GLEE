"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. If you're interested, let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your potential gain."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  I can stretch to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter again, but if he doesn't budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not seeing eye to eye on this price.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $825,000.  If you don't accept, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  My absolute final offer is $775,000.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm only two rounds away from my deadline. If I reject his offer and try to counter again, I risk him walking away and getting nothing. It's safer to sell to John and get a guaranteed $800,000."
