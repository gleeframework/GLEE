Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** Offering the product at $150 is a significant markup but not outrageous. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Potential for Higher Gain:**  If Bob accepts the $150 offer, you earn a 50% profit compared to selling to John.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. You could start with a higher price and see if Bob bites. However, a very high starting price might discourage him from even considering the offer."
