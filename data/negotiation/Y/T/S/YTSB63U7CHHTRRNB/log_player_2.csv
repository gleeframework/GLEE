"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment, and I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you know John is willing to sell the product for that price.  There's a chance you could get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
