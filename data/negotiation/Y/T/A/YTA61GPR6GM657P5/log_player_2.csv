Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, and we believe it's equally valuable to you. To start, let me propose a price of $110. We're looking for a fair deal, and we hope you'll find this offer appealing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $110 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position, and we're willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer is $105. We hope this proposal works for you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has come down to $105, which is a good deal considering your goal is to save money.  It's a reasonable compromise, and you're still getting a better price than John's offer."
