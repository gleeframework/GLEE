"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's still a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. How about we settle at $90?  That's a significant step up from my previous offer and gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $90 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let's get this deal done!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a really nice product and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can do $100, but that's really the absolute most I can spend.  What do you say, deal?",100.0,Bob,6,
