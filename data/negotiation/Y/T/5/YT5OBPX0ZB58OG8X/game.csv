"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I am very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Could we consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree it's a fair price, I'm working with a tight budget.  Could we settle at $1,400,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,550,000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
