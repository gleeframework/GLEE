Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,500,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my maximum limit is $800,000, I'm willing to offer you $600,000 to start. I believe this price reflects the value the product holds for me, and it leaves room for us to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
