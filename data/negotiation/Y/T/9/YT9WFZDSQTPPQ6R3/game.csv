"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  Given its unique value, I'm offering it for $2,500,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,500,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my maximum limit is $800,000, I'm willing to offer you $600,000 to start. I believe this price reflects the value the product holds for me, and it leaves room for us to negotiate further.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for providing your perspective on the value.  While $600,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm encouraged that we both see the potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $2,000,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your needs. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, but that's as low as I can go at this point. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
