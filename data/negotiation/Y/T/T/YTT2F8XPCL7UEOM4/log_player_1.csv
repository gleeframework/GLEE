Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm leaving room for a bit of compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial valuation, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. This should be a good middle ground for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
