**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He won't buy from John for $1,200,000 when he values the product at $1,200,000. He's trying to push the price down. Accepting his offer at $1,750,000 would be the ideal outcome for maximum profit, but his bluff and ""final offer"" tactic suggests he might go even lower in future rounds. It's too risky to continue negotiating when you have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John."
