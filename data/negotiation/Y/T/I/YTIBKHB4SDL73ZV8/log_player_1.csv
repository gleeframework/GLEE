Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. If he rejects it, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net, giving me flexibility in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I believe I can do better.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards to $1,350,000.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit for myself.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and agree to this price, avoiding further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and while it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer, as further negotiations might lead to a lower price or a longer process. The risk of reaching a stalemate and having to sell to John for $1,000,000 is too high at this point.  $1,250,000 is a decent profit and ensures a quick sale."
