Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you while still offering Bob a price lower than his perceived value. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
