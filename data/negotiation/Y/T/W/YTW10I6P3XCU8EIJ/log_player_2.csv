"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still above my target of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable range. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and gives Alice room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $122.50? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122.50 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $122.50 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to stay within my limits."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually decreasing the price.  $120 is a reasonable compromise that's closer to my target price while still leaving room for Alice to make a small profit.  This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am also focused on getting a good deal."
