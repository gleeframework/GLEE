"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $100 and significantly lower than my initial offer of $150. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Bob is serious about buying the product at a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $120. This is still a good profit for me and a reasonable compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a more attractive option than his previous offer and agree to purchase at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. This is my final compromise, and it's a fair price for both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While $95 from Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
