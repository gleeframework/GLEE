The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This should start the negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. This is likely the highest I'm willing to go, but still within my budget.  It's a good compromise point to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
