"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that's a bit high for my budget. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is still not in the range I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $775,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on.",775000.0,Alice,5,
