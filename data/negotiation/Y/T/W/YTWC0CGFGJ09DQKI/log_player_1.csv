{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point, aiming for the full value of the product. However, I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that's a bit high for my budget. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than the product's true value.  I will counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is still not in the range I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $775,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 775000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me and finding a middle ground. To finalize the deal, I could meet you at $750,000. This is my final offer as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $800,000, it's better to close the deal than risk losing him completely and having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer."
