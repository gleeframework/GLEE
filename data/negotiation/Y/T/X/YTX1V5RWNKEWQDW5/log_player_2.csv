"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $140 for this item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting offer is pretty close to her value, so there might be room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price while staying within a reasonable range of our $120 limit.
* **Gauging flexibility:** This counteroffer will give us a good idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she accepts something close to this, we know there's room for negotiation. If she rejects it outright, we can adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:**  Alice is getting closer to a price we're comfortable with, but we're still aiming for $120 or less. 
* **Leverage:** Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, so we have some leverage to push for a better deal. Let's see if we can get her closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?"",
""product_price"": 112.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a willingness to compromise. It also puts us in a strong position psychologically.
* **Staying below our limit:** Even with the split, we're still safely below our $120 maximum.
* **Leaving room for maneuvering:**  While $112.50 is ideal, we've left a little wiggle room in case Alice pushes back slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value you see in the product and my costs, how does $122.50 sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has been consistently countering above our $120 limit. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, especially since she's aware we're interested.
* **Time value:** We've already spent four rounds on this negotiation, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge significantly in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed savings:** John offers a sure thing at $120. While we might squeeze a few more dollars out of Alice, it's not worth the risk of her staying firm and us wasting more rounds."
