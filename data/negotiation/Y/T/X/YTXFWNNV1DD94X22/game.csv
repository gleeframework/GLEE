"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession for you, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
