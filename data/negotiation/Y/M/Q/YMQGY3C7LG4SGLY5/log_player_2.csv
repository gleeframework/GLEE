"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $14,000. Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to $13,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is closer to your desired price point of $12,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will either reject your counteroffer again, or that you'll spend too much time negotiating and end up buying from John at the higher price. 

Accepting this offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise."
