Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a good profit at $14,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It sets a strong initial price:**  Starting high lets you potentially secure a higher sale price while still leaving space for negotiations. 

Remember, you can always use the John option as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for negotiation. You can likely get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $14,000. You might consider offering a price around $13,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to $13,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer balances a few things:

* **Compromise:** It shows you're willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Strong position:** It doesn't drop your price too drastically, maintaining your leverage.
* **Openness:** The message encourages further negotiation, signaling a willingness to find a mutually beneficial outcome.

Remember, you still have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if you feel the negotiations with Bob aren't going in your favor."
