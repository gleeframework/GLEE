"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit beyond my minimum threshold. Bob might reject, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, we'll continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 yet, especially since I have a guaranteed sale for that amount with John. I'm hoping Bob will eventually come up to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm making a final offer at my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, but if not, I'll be ready to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offers have been steadily decreasing, and we're now in the 6th round.  It's unlikely he'll meet my minimum price, and I'm running out of time.  John's offer guarantees me my desired profit, so it's the safer choice."
