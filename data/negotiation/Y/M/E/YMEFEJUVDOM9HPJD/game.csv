"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000. This would still be a good deal for you as you value it at $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
