Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can get a better deal than $950,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price closer to what I feel is fair given our previous discussions. How about $1,000,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as what John is willing to pay.  Since there's no risk of getting a higher offer from Bob, it's better to close the deal now and avoid the potential of further negotiation."
