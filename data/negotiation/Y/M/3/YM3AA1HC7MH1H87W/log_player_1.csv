Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $180.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you think the product is ""worth a lot"", you are subtly anchoring its value in Bob's mind as being higher than $180. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously and potentially negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
