"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly tone might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Asking for feedback:** This encourages Bob to respond and gives me insight into his initial thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **More rounds available:** I have 8 more rounds to explore a better offer.  Selling to John now would leave me with less profit than potentially negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you and closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving from my initial $150 offer.
* **Reasonable counter:** $130 is closer to my minimum price of $120 but still potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even with the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited time:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is high.
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting Bob's offer could lead to a positive relationship for potential future sales."
