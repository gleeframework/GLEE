Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it offers significant value and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start high in a negotiation. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is potentially higher than Bob's perceived $12,000 by mentioning ""significant value.""
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While you have John as a backup, the goal is to maximize profit, so aiming higher with Bob is advantageous. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's very price-sensitive, you might adjust your starting price down a bit.
* **Market Demand:** If the product is in high demand and you have other potential buyers besides John, you could consider an even higher starting price."
