Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and it's well above my minimum of $10,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good deal for myself while also giving Bob a chance to negotiate.  I've also included a message to emphasize the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing. I'd like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him a little higher.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,250. This still provides you a great deal, and it's closer to my expectations. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
