"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential for you.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
