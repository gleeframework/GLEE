"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. As we discuss the price, I want to be transparent that the market value of this product is $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant reduction from the market value of $1,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business and personal life. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a little hesitant.  How about we settle at $800,000? That's a firm offer from me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is my final offer.
