"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still too low. Let's compromise at $8,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
