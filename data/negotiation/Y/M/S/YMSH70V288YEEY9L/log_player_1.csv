Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1000000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on this valuable product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go below $1,100,000. This product is truly unique and offers immense potential. Let's meet halfway and seal this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. Is this within your consideration range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and I'm confident that I can make a profit on this sale.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, and I'd rather secure this sale than risk waiting for a better offer."
