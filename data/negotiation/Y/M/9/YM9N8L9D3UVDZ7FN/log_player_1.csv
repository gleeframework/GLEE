"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""substantial benefits"" to justify the high initial price.  
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John open. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for the minimum, especially since Bob's counter-offer was a significant jump from my initial ask.  I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, the price you proposed doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000 to find a compromise that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  I'm showing flexibility by decreasing my price by $250,000, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:**  I'm still well above Bob's offer, as I believe the product is worth significantly more. The aim is to gradually reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message continues to highlight the inherent value of the product to justify the relatively high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now moving closer to the middle ground, which is a positive sign.  While $1,750,000 is tempting, I still believe I can push for a bit more, especially with 6 rounds remaining. The risk of John's offer is always there, but for now, I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product.  This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm reducing my price by $100,000 this time, indicating I'm nearing my desired range.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message includes ""Let's make this happen"" to subtly encourage Bob to close the deal sooner rather than later.
* **Final Offer Implication:**  While not explicitly my final offer, the smaller concession and tone suggest I'm getting close to my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a final price of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  $1,800,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **""Final Price"" Signal:** Bob's use of ""final price"" suggests he's unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Factor:**  While I have rounds remaining, there's no guarantee of further concessions from Bob. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely."
