I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $950,000 I initially offered. I believe I can potentially get a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is close to my initial counteroffer of $900,000 and represents a significant increase from his previous offer of $850,000. While I would ideally prefer a higher price, accepting this offer would secure a sale that is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
