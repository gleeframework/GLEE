"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John. This means you can make a counteroffer to Alice that is lower than $90.  There's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $80.  A counteroffer of $85 is a reasonable starting point, offering a bit more than her valuation but still significantly less than the $90 she initially offered and $100 that John is selling for. This gives Alice a chance to make a profit while also giving you a better price than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is only $2 less than what John is selling for. There is no reason to continue negotiating with Alice, as the potential savings are very small and you risk wasting more time. Buying from John guarantees you the product for a price that is within your budget and saves you the effort of further negotiations."
