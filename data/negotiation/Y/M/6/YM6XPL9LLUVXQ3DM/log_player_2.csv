Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the compromise.

Alice is not negotiating reasonably.  She went up in price after Bob offered a compromise. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's acceptable within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the product from John at the known price of $12,000."
