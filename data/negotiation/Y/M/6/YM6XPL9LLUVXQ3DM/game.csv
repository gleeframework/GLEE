"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me.  Would you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think it's worth $10,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the compromise.",17000.0,Alice,5,
