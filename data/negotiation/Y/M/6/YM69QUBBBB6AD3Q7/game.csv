"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $140?  That's a pretty generous compromise on my end.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the movement towards a compromise, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
