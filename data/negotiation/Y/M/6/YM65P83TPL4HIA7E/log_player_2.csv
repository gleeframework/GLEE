"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price closer to his own value of $15,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11500? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for a good price, saving him a significant amount compared to buying from John. While there might be room for further negotiation, the potential savings aren't substantial enough to warrant the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or Bob having to buy from John."
