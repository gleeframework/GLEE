Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's $150 valuation to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While I could start higher, asking for a price too close to Bob's maximum might make him feel like I'm not negotiating in good faith. This could make him walk away, even though the deal is good for him.
* **Secure a Profit Above John's Offer:**  The $140 offer ensures I make a significantly better profit than selling to John for $100."
