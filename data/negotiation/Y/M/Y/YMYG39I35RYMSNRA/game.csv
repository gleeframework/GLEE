"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for it. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but this product is truly worth it.  How about $11,750, and we have a deal?",11750.0,Alice,7,
