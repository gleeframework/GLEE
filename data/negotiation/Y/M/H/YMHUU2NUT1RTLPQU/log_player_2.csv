"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to your budget while leaving room for further negotiation. It starts with a significant but not unreasonable reduction from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500? That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above John's price. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target price."

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows a willingness to compromise while still working towards a price closer to your desired budget."
