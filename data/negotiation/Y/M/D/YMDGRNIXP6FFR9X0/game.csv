"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,300,000 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $1,200,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,250,000? That's the lowest I can go without losing money on this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
