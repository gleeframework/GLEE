"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. The product is a great value, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me, but $10,500 is just too low for me to consider. This product is worth a lot to both of us, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll propose $11,375. Can you consider that?",11375.0,Bob,6,
