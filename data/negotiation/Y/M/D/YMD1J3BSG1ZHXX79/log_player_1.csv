Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $10,500. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me, but $10,500 is just too low for me to consider.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,375

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay as close to his initial lowball offer as possible.  The increments are getting smaller, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable before the rounds run out. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk."
