"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps build rapport.
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial $150 asking price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John immediately would mean accepting the minimum, whereas rejecting and counter-offering gives me the opportunity to potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest! While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not drastically, maintaining some negotiation leverage.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""reflects the value of the product"") makes my counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Again, I encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still thinking $120 is a good price for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but there's still room for a slight increase.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting again gives me the opportunity to make one more counteroffer, potentially getting closer to $135.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John now guarantees $120, I'm willing to risk one more round to potentially get $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $125.  I'm still feeling a bit underpriced at that point, but I'm willing to make a final compromise. How about $130? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm signaling that this is my last counteroffer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm stressing the ""fair price"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Framing:**  ""Happy to finalize the deal"" creates a sense of urgency and a positive outlook."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I'm not going any higher. Can we finalize the deal at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $125 is the highest he's been willing to go, and I've already made my final compromise. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away completely.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better price in the next round. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $120 is secure, accepting Bob's offer means $5 more. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice given the circumstances. It maximizes my potential earnings while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
