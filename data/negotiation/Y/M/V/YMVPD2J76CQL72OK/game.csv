"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to the market value.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
