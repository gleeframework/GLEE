"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and gauge his potential budget. I'm confident in the product's value, and I'm not afraid to ask for what I believe it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm coming down a bit, but still holding firm on the value of the product. $950,000 is a more realistic price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time and offer $900,000. It's a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum, and we are at round 6. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $875,000. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's unlikely Bob will go higher, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
