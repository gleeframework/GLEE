"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable spending.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go a little higher.  How about we settle on $1,100,000?  This is a fair price that reflects a compromise from both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is close, but I can't go that low. My final offer is $1,175,000. This represents a significant price reduction on my end and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
