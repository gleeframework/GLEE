Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable spending.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
