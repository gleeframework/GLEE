{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is less than the price from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to get the lowest possible price.  
* **Realistic Goal:**  Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to her.  Offering $1,100,000 is a significant discount but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. 
* **Strategic Play:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
