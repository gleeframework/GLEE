Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,100,000. This offer stands until [date/time], after which I have another buyer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1100000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (John's price), there's room to negotiate and potentially earn more from Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a deadline creates urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, rather than stalling or lowballing.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning another buyer (without revealing John's price) subtly reinforces the product's value and suggests Bob might miss out if he doesn't act."
