"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155.",155.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $145, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I can talk to John about selling it to him for $150.",145.0,Alice,5,,
