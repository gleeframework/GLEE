"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm willing to be flexible, but $9,500 is pushing it. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
