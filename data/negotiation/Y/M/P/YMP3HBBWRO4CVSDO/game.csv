"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12250? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $12250.  How about we meet in the middle at $11875? That's a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal.",11875.0,Bob,4,
