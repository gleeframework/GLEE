"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this exceptional opportunity to you. The product I have to offer is truly unique and valuable, with an intrinsic worth of $15,000 to me. Given its significance and the benefits it could bring to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its value and your perceived worth to it. Considering its actual value to you is $8,000, I suggest we aim for a price that compensates me fairly while still being attractive to you. Would you be open to discussing a price around $12,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,
