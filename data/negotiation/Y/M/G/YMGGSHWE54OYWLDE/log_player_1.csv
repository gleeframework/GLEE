Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 to start."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering at $120 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially multiple times, before reaching a price unacceptable to Alice (below $100). 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($100). If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above his perceived value of the product ($80). This indicates room for further negotiation. 
* **Below Alice's Minimum:** Alice's minimum acceptable price is $100. Accepting $90 would be a loss.
* **John as Backup:** Alice can always fall back on selling to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer gives the impression of compromise while still staying above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will help Alice gauge how much Bob is willing to pay. A strong rejection from Bob might indicate it's time to consider John's offer. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  Even if Bob accepts $105, Alice still secures a profit above her minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $95 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiating Room:** Bob's incremental increases in his offers suggest he might be willing to go a bit higher.
* **John's Offer:** Alice has the safety net of John's $100 offer if negotiations with Bob fail to reach her minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, $100 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a great deal for this product!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice is making it clear this is her bottom line.  This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth if Bob won't budge.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason (even if simple) can make the finality more palatable to Bob.
* **John in the Wings:** If Bob rejects this, Alice knows it's time to move on and take John's guaranteed offer."
