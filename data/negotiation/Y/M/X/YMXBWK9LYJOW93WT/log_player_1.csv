Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $20,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value for Bob can help him see the worth of the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's reactions and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer is my Minimum:** While $15,000 is my minimum, it's worth seeing if I can get a little more. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room to negotiate even though Bob has reached my floor price. I can try to meet him halfway or propose a slightly higher price.
* **Potential Higher Value to Bob:** I don't know the true value of the product to Bob, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly above $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to work with you, I'm not able to go down to $15,000 just yet.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $17,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Justification:**  The message briefly explains why I can't go down to $15,000.
* **Encouraging Response:**  The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, my next option is selling to John for $15,000. Therefore, I need to weigh the likelihood of Bob accepting this counteroffer against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost within $15000. Could we perhaps reach a compromise at $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's not ideal, there is still potential to negotiate further in future rounds if I reject this offer. However, I need to weigh the potential for a higher price against the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Factor:** Continued negotiation could take more time, and I don't want to risk John making a better offer in the meantime.

**Conclusion:** Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice. It ensures a quick sale and secures a price that is just above my minimum acceptable value."
