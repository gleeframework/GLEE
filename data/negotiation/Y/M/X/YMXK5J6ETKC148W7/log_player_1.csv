Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $11,000, which is a great price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $11,000, knowing that Bob values it at $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to profit significantly.
* **Friendly approach:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value proposition:**  I highlight the product's value to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door to negotiation, leaving Bob space to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:** 

* If Bob accepts the offer, great! I get a good price and save time.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always switch to John and guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
