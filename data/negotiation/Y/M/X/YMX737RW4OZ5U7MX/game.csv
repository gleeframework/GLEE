"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price still allows you to profit significantly, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $1,200,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
