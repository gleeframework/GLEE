{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $7,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm starting to run out of time.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's close enough to my desired price point. It's better to secure the deal with John than risk a further decline in price with Bob."
