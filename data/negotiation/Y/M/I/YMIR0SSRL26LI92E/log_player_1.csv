"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point and hopefully makes Bob understand the value I place on the product. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but it's important to set the bar high initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to get a bit worried about Bob's low offers, I'm still not willing to sell for $700,000. It's too far below my desired price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $850,000. This is a substantial reduction from my last offer, and it's getting closer to Bob's offer.  It's a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  I'm starting to run out of time and rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or potentially ending up with no deal.  I'll sell to John."
