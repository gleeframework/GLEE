Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to go lower or stick to John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $100 immediately might make Bob think the product is worth less or that you're desperate to sell."
