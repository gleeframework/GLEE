"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely an interesting product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant but not unreasonable drop in price.  It leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much, and shows you're serious about buying but also value-conscious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still trying to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, it's still above your ideal target.  There's room for further negotiation, and you're still in an early stage of the process. You can likely get a better price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, appreciate the offer. I'm getting closer, but $105 is the highest I can go at this point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying and willing to compromise, but you're sticking to your goal of getting a good deal. By offering $105, you're  demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway while keeping some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a bit more than $105. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price. You've already shown Alice you're serious about buying and willing to negotiate.  With a few more rounds, you might be able to secure a better price.  It's worth exploring those options before settling at $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm happy to go up a bit, but $110 is the highest I can do. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  You're showing a willingness to meet halfway, increasing your offer by $5.
* **Clear Intent:** You're stating that $110 is your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and respectful tone, even while you're setting a firm price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was hoping to get a bit more than $110. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $112.50 is very close to your ideal price range, especially since we're in the middle of the negotiation.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 3 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for loss:** If you reject and Alice refuses to budge, you might end up buying from John at $120.

While a bit above your ideal, it's a fair price considering the negotiation progress and the risk of losing the deal."
