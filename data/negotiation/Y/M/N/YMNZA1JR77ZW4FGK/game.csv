"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000, giving you a substantial profit margin. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
