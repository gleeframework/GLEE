"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
