Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150 (its value to you), there's no room for negotiation, and Bob will likely decline. 
* **Find a Middle Ground:** Offering it at $125 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $25 from his perceived value) while you still make a $25 profit. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
