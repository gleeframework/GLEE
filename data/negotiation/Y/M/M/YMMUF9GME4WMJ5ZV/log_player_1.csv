Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $10,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $10,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, leaving you with some profit if he accepts.

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation while still keeping the price within a profitable range for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum. This makes rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate a higher price the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $8,500 and my previous offer of $10,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,250 is still significantly above Bob's value but below my minimum. This allows for potential room to negotiate further, while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Maintaining John as an Option:** I'm still keeping John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price."
