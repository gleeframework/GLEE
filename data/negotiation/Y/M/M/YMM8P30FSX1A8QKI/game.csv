"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $600000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $750000, which is a significant amount for me.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $750000, which would be $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand the value of the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
