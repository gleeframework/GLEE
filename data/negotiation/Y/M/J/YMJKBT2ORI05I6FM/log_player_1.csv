Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation and still represents a good value for Bob, since he values it at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can push for a bit more. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,250. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, and hopefully, he'll find it agreeable."
