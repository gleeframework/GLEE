"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do better than $90, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $95. How about we meet at $105? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $108? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $108. Let's split the difference and go with $104. This way, we both get a good deal. What do you say?",104.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $104 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we try $110 again? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth it considering the product's value to you.",110.0,Alice,9,
