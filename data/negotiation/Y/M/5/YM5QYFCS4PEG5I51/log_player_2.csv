{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This gives us a good starting point for negotiation and shows Alice we are serious about getting a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offer, and while it's getting closer to our maximum, there's still room for negotiation.  We have a few rounds left, so rejecting and counter-offering gives us a chance to secure a lower price before we have to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a point where buying from John might become the more attractive option.

This strategy aims to push Alice closer to our preferred price point while acknowledging that time is running out."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $998,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $998,437.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to our maximum, and we only have one round left.  It's unlikely we can negotiate a better price in the remaining time.  Although it's not our ideal price, buying from John at $1,200,000 ensures we get the product. This minimizes the risk of not getting the product at all and saves valuable time."
