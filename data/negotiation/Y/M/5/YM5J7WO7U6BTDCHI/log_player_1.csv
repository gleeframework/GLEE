"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Starting high gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Fairness Justification:** Mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value"" subtly attempts to gauge Bob's perceived value without giving away too much information.
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping the message positive and friendly encourages Bob to engage. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get the highest possible price from Bob, but I'm also aware of the John safety net at $800,000. This first offer sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1000000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer matches my floor price of $800,000, which is the same price I can sell to John. While this is a good outcome, it's not the best I can aim for.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 8 rounds left, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
* **Gaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's counteroffer gives me more leverage and signals my desire to secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than $800,000 to see if I can get Bob to budge. My goal is to get a price as close to $1,000,000 as possible while still securing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving down from my initial offer. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to discussion.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a small but meaningful gain over my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still maintaining a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $825000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 away from my floor price of $800,000. 
* **Time and Risk:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away or my time running out, forcing me to sell to John at my floor price. 
* **Good Deal:** Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a good price, well above my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, accepting this offer secures a profitable deal and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
