"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer you a price of $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
