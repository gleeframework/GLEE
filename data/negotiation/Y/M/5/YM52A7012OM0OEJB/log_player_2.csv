"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move. Offering $950,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price of $1,100,000. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still being within your budget. This should encourage Alice to consider your offer and potentially counter with a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is within your budget and represents a significant drop from her initial offer. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice may become unwilling to sell at a lower price, and you'll be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting this offer guarantees you the product at a price that is favorable and within your budget."
