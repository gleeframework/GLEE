{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very special product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return on investment. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize potential profit. It also emphasizes the value and potential of the product to pique Bob's interest.  

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to get a higher price. It allows for negotiation while providing a clear starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a substantial sum, it's below the minimum value I've set for the product ($1,000,000).  I'm not ready to accept this offer, especially considering John is willing to pay a higher price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can try to push for a higher price closer to my desired range. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates that he genuinely wants the product. This gives me leverage in negotiations. 

By rejecting the offer, I keep the door open for a more favorable outcome, potentially reaching a price closer to my ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, $900,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the potential of this product and reflects its true worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:**  This counteroffer moves towards Bob's price, showing willingness to negotiate. However, it still maintains a significant markup, demonstrating my confidence in the product's value. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message reinforces the potential and value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Compromise:** By proposing a price in the middle, I'm showing good faith and demonstrating flexibility.

This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency while still allowing for further negotiation. It balances the need to secure a fair price with the risk of losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1050000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 surpasses my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer secures a sale that meets my minimum requirements and potentially leaves room for future negotiations. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but accepting Bob's offer opens the possibility of earning an additional $50,000.  
* **Building a Relationship:** Accepting Bob's offer helps establish a positive relationship for future potential transactions.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that meets my minimum needs while leaving the door open for a potentially stronger relationship with Bob in the future."
