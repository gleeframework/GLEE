"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, $900000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1200000.  I believe this price is fair considering the potential of this product and reflects its true worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1050000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I expect to get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
