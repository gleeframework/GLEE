"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum is $800000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1200000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I'm willing to make a purchase today. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a decision today. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1000000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
