"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's true value while still offering you a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
