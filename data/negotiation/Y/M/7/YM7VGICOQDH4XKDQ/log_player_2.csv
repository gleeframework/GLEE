"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its benefits, I'm offering it for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $11,500 is above your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $12,000 gives you leverage in negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  Offering $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer and shows you're serious about negotiation. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  This price is within your budget and still leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Positive tone:** Keeping the message friendly helps maintain a good rapport with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $11,000 is still above your budget.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still a gap between your desired price ($10,500) and Alice's offer.  
* **Don't rush into a deal:** You have 7 more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  Offering $10,750 is a smaller jump than before, showing you're getting closer to Alice's position while staying within your budget.
* **Compromise:** This price is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** Keeping the message positive and focused on finding a solution helps keep the negotiations productive."

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, and $10,900 is now within your budget.
* **Potential for a good deal:** You're saving $100 compared to John's price, which is a significant savings.
* **Limited time:**  You only have 5 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate may not lead to a better offer."
