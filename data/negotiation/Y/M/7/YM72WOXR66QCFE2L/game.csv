"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I think the starting price of $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
