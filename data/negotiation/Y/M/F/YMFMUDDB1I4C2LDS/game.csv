"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $2,000,000 is far too high for me. Given my research, I believe a fair starting point for the product would be $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which reflects a fair value for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a fair price that respects both of our positions.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
