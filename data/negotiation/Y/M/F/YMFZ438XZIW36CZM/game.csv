"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to offer $500,000 as a starting point for more realistic negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,600,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement on price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $650,000. I believe that's a fair offer, considering market value and my needs.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make another adjustment to reach a deal.  I can drop to $950,000. This is a substantial compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's really the most I can do.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's important to reach a deal soon.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, closing this deal sooner rather than later is in both our best interests. How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? That demonstrates my willingness to compromise for a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Alice,7,
