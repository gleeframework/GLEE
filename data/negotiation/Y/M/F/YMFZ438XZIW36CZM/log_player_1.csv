Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to offer $500,000 as a starting point for more realistic negotiations.

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to John's offer, but Bob is moving slowly. By continuing to counter, we can try to push him closer to $800,000, which is his estimated value of the product.  We still have time before considering John's offer."
