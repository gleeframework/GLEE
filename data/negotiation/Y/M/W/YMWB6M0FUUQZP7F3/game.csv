"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  This price is still well above your stated value and offers us both a good margin for profit. Let's see if we can find a solution in this range.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a competitive price.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I can't go as low as $1,050,000.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to make this deal work, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This offer demonstrates good faith on both sides and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
