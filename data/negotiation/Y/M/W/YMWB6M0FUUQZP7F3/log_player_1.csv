"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) than mine ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation but sets a strong anchor. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its value to him without revealing my own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point"" clearly indicates my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving room to reach an agreement with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  This price is still well above your stated value and offers us both a good margin for profit. Let's see if we can find a solution in this range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but I still have room to negotiate and 8 rounds left. I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to try and secure a higher price.  Bob's message also suggests he's aware I have a lower limit in mind, making me less inclined to accept his first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a competitive price.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I can't go as low as $1,050,000.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing understanding for his position. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Holding Firm (But Fair):**  While I'm coming down slightly, I'm not meeting Bob's price directly. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why a higher price is justified. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Using the phrase ""fair compromise"" positions my counteroffer as a balanced solution, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm eager to make this deal work, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This offer demonstrates good faith on both sides and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $1,075,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Strong Negotiating Position Unlikely:** While I could try to push for more, Bob is consistently staying above my minimum and incrementally moving towards it. There's a risk he won't go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties associated with further negotiation.

Bob's use of ""good faith"" and ""mutually beneficial"" suggests he's getting close to his limit, making this a reasonable point to accept."
