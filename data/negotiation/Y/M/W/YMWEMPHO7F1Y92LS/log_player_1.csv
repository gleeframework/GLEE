Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider offers up to $8,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to go beyond $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firmly rooted at $8,000 and unlikely to budge. It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $10,000 from John for a small chance of getting more from Bob."
