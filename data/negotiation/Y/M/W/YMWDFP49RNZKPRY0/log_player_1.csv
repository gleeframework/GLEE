{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's unique qualities to increase its perceived value in Bob's eyes.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high benchmark.  I can then adjust my price based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new offer. If the negotiations stall or become too time-consuming, I can always fall back to selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to try and secure a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a great opportunity to own a truly unique product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price.  
* **Highlighting value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's uniqueness to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to potentially close the deal at a higher price while still remaining open to negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can further adjust my price based on his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down to $19000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point. While I could sell to John for $15,000, there's still potential to make a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $18,500.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get what we want. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Showing flexibility:** I'm again lowering my price, but I'm sticking to a price that is closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm highlighting that this is a good compromise for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob. If he rejects, I will proceed with selling to John for $15,000 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $17,000 is now too close to my minimum price of $15,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed sale with John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely take more time and may not result in a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, which is still a good outcome.
* **Risk aversion:**  The potential for a better deal with Bob is outweighed by the risk of further negotiation delays and a potential failure to reach an agreement.

By selling to John, I am securing a certain profit and avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
