Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, indicating I'm open to discussion and willing to find a middle ground. 
* **John as a Backup:**  The knowledge that I have another buyer willing to pay $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. This means there's potential for a counteroffer to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob, ensuring I don't settle for an unacceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a counteroffer that shows flexibility while still being profitable.
* **Highlight the value:**  I emphasize the deal's value for Bob to make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Staying friendly helps keep the negotiation open and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 
* **Remaining above my minimum:**  $125 is above my minimum price of $150, but it allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, it leaves no room for profit.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation is going back and forth, and there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. 
* **John's offer is a better deal:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a higher profit and a quicker transaction.

Given these factors, selling to John is the best decision in this situation."
