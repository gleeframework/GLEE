"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit steep for me right now. How about $105? I'm really interested in the product but my budget is tight.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is the highest I can go, let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $112.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
