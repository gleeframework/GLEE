Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John provides a safety net at $800,000, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain for Alice. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price.  
* **Urgency (Implied):**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, Alice gains significantly more than selling to John. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still fall back on the guaranteed $800,000."
