"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $140 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to work within those parameters. To better accommodate you, I would like to propose an offer of $135 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value I place on it and your budget considerations. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $130?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer! $132 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $128. This would allow me to buy the product while still staying within my budget. What do you think?",128.0,Bob,6,

I hope this proposal meets your budgetary requirements and allows us to reach a satisfactory agreement.",130.0,Alice,7,
