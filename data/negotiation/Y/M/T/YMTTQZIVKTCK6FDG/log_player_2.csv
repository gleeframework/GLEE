"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to own our premium product. It's a unique offering that aligns perfectly with your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $8,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is friendly, her offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation or a better deal. Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility that she might come back with a lower price. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
