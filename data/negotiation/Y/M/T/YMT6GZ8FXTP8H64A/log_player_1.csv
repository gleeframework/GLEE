While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,575,000 makes the most strategic sense at this point:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's a $575,000 profit over my minimum. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing the deal, especially with my final offer declared. Accepting now secures the sale.
* **Uncertainty with Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee Bob would move significantly from his last offer, and I risk him walking away entirely. 

Accepting the $1,575,000 balances risk and reward effectively."
