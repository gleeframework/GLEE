"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is still more than Bob's maximum price of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $10,000. This counteroffer leaves some room for Alice to negotiate while still being significantly lower than her initial offer and well within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $11,500 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get an even better price. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again allows for more bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying below Alice's offer. It also keeps some room for negotiation in case Alice is willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price. While Bob could continue to negotiate, accepting the offer at $11,200 ensures he gets the product within his budget while saving $3,800 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a higher price or a stalemate, making accepting the current offer the most logical choice."
