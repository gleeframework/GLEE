"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $850,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we agree on $925,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I must admit, I'm a bit disappointed.  You seem firm at $875,000, and to be honest, that number doesn't reflect the true value of this product. However, I value our discussions and want to see this work out. If you can agree to $900,000, we have a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
