Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Above Bob's value:**  It's higher than Bob's estimated value, but not excessively so. 
* **Below my value:**  It's lower than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate down.
* **Encourages negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and willingness to find a middle ground.

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit with the potential for a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it represents a quick sale, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to risk continued negotiation with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore if a compromise with Bob is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for your business.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'd be happy to accept $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer justification:**  The message acknowledges Bob's offer, but firmly states that it's not acceptable. It emphasizes the value of the product while expressing willingness to negotiate.
* **New offer:**  $1,350,000 represents a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the positive outcome for both parties, emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the proposed price.

This approach aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer without completely closing the door to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still below my desired price, it's a significant improvement from his initial offer and getting closer to my minimum. This represents a potentially successful deal that avoids further negotiation and ensures a quicker sale.  Although selling to John guarantees the highest price, the potential for delay and uncertainty with John makes accepting Bob's offer a more attractive option."
