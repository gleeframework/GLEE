"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for your business.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'd be happy to accept $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
