# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget.  It's always best to start by rejecting and then making a counteroffer, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price. You can counteroffer again and see if you can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $117.50? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $117.50 is still above your maximum budget of $100. While you could continue negotiating, you've already gone through several rounds, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it's the most financially sensible choice at this point. You'll save $17.50 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
