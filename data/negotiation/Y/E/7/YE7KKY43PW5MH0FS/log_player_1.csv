"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, but lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives him a good starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for me to increase the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's a fair price for me, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92.50 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a risk he could get even lower, or we might run out of rounds. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower amount."
