Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, knowing the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still getting a good price. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before reaching my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  I'm not immediately jumping to John's offer because it's my goal to maximize profit. I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I still believe I can do better.
* **Potential for counteroffers:**  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **Maximizing profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible.  Selling to John for $8,000 would be a quick solution, but it wouldn't be the most profitable choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $9,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Staying within my range:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and within the range where I believe Bob is likely to accept.
* **Avoiding stalling:** I'm trying to reach a deal quickly, as too many rounds of counteroffers could lead to a breakdown in negotiations or Bob losing interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has stubbornly remained at $8,500, and I'm unlikely to get him to budge further.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out altogether.
* **Maximizing profit:** While I prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,500 is a decent profit and a reasonable outcome considering Bob's reluctance to negotiate.  Selling to John for $8,000 would be a worse outcome."
