"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Given my valuation and the value to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
