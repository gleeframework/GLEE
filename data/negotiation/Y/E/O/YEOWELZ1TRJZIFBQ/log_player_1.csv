"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob.  This sets the initial bargaining point and forces Bob to make the first counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to try and push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $160. This is still a good price for Bob, but it's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have time to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $155. This is still a good profit for me and it's a reasonable compromise considering our previous negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to try and push for a price closer to $150.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have time to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter with $145.  Bob has been consistently going down, and I'm going to meet him halfway this time. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm hoping this is the offer that gets accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum.  I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. I'm going to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit."
