{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit low for me."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my goal, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100 if things don't work out."

Round 6

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept and secure the sale, I'm still within my acceptable range.  There's a chance I can get closer to my ideal price with another round of negotiation.  I'm also mindful of John's offer as a fallback option."
