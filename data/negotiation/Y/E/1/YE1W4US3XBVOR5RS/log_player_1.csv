{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and upbeat, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the value of the product, which could potentially sway Bob to pay more.

**Next steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll likely drop the price slightly in my counteroffer. If he makes a counteroffer, I'll consider it based on how close it is to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $95 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **John is a backup:** I have John as a reliable buyer willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me the leverage to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, likely around $105. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm still keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Focusing on fairness:** I emphasize that $105 is a ""fair price"" for both of us, which could make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll be happy to sell the product at $105. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to lower my offer further or stick to my minimum price and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I am still looking to keep the cost within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $100 is only $20 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **No guarantee of a better offer:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, or that John will still be available.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to a lengthy negotiation or even a stalemate.  

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This is a good outcome, considering my minimum price and the risk of losing the sale."
