"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it allows some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125.  This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling but I'm not going to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $110, which is closer to my ideal price.  While I'd like to get even more, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might lose the deal entirely.  It's better to take the $110 than risk ending up with only $100 from John."
