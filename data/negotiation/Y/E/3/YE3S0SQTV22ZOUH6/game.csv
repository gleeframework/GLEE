"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit away from that price point.  Would you consider $9,000? That would work much better for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium support package and a 10% discount on any future purchases from me. This way, you'll get a great deal and some additional value on top of the product. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
