Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium support package and a 10% discount on any future purchases from me. This way, you'll get a great deal and some additional value on top of the product. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the extras Alice is offering are tempting, they don't justify exceeding your $10,000 budget. You can get the product for $10,000 from John without any hassle. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
