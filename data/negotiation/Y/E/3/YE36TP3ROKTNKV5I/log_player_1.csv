Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:**  $100 is higher than your minimum selling price of $80.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him incentive to accept. 
* **Is a clear and concise message:**  It states the price upfront and invites a response. 

By starting with a slightly lower price, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal that's favorable for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $90 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below my desired profit margin. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a price closer to my initial asking price of $100.  

I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows flexibility and signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $95 is still above my minimum selling price of $80, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message emphasizes appreciation for Bob's offer and expresses willingness to negotiate further."
