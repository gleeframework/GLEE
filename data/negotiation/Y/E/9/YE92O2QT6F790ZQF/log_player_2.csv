"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth less to Alice than what she's offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $11,000 is already a very competitive price for this product considering its value. To meet you halfway, I could consider $10,250. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $10,250 is still more than Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly better than John's offer of $12,000. It's also a compromise that reflects Alice's willingness to negotiate.  While Bob could try to counter-offer again, the risk of Alice rejecting and leaving him with only John's option outweighs the potential savings."
