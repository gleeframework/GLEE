Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially another buyer if I keep negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $128? I'm really close to walking away and buying it from John for $150 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum price, it's important to consider:

* **Time is running out:**  We're already in Round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left.  
* **Bob's leverage:** He's mentioned John, implying he has a good alternative if we don't reach a deal. This makes him less likely to budge further.
* **Potential for a loss:**  If I keep rejecting and he walks away, I'll have to sell to John at a lower price.

This offer gives me a decent profit, and it's better than potentially losing money by being too stubborn."
