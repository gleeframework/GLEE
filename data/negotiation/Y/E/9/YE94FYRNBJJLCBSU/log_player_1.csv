Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price of $1,500,000 with John. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup with John. This allows me to take a calculated risk and try to get a higher price from Bob."
