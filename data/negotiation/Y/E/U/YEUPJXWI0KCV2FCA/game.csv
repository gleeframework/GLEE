"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would that be feasible?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is just not enough for me to move forward.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
