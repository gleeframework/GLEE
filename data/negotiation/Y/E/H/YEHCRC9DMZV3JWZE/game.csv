"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm thinking of a price of $110. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $105? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $98, let's see if we can close the gap.",98.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $98, but I'm willing to meet you at $102. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",102.0,Alice,7,
