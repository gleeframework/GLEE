"Bob, I'm offering you a truly unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. I'm confident it will be of great benefit to you, and I'm prepared to sell it for $1500000. This price reflects the product's inherent worth, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1000000 to $1200000. I would like to propose an initial price of $1100000 to start our negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1100000 is a considerable sum, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a price that is fair to me. I'm proposing a price of $1250000. This price is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it is still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
