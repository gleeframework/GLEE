Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the returns you'll see. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product has a lot of potential, but I'm still concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,150,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price. It's always possible negotiations could stall or Bob could lowball in later rounds. Taking this offer secures a good deal now."
