"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit too low for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $975,000 is my final offer.  It's a great price for such a valuable product.  Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
