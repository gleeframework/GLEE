Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is too low for me. I need to make more than that to make this deal worthwhile. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $925,000 is still too low.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
