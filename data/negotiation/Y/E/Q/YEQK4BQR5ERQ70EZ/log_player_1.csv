Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly unique and significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price given the market value and my own needs. If you're unwilling to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is holding firm at a price far below the product's value to me. It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss, and it's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer."
