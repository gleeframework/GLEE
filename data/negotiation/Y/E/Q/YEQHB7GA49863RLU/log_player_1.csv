Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I'll then have a better understanding of his real willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is still a significant discount from my minimum value but is closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
