"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to start with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this price is still fair and might encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my ideal price and a good compromise. I'm willing to accept it at this point, as further negotiations might lead to a lower price or a risk of losing the deal to John."
