"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get a lower price, especially since he's willing to pay up to $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,000 is a bold move but it's still within his budget. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in negotiating and shows his willingness to pay a fair price. The offer is also likely to be attractive to Alice since it's significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer and still significantly less than John's offer. At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept and secure the product at a favorable price. Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice rejecting further offers or Bob losing the product to another buyer."
