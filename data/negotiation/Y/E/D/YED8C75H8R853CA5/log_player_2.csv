Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also holding firm at a price point above her own valuation. At $10,875, we're getting very close to the maximum we're willing to pay. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price. Accepting now avoids the risk of her retracting the offer, forcing us to either pay John's higher price or lose the deal entirely."
