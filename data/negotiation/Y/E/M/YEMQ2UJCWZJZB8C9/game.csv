"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is still a very good deal for you considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
