# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, claiming it's worth $1,200,000 to you when you know your upper limit.
* While $950,000 is less than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Alice is motivated to sell since the product's value to her ($800,000) is less than her offer.

By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aware the price is too high and open the door for a counter-offer closer to a price that benefits both of you."
