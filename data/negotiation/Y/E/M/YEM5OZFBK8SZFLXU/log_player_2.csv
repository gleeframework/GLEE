"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential benefits for you, I propose a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John, but you'll be spending less overall."
