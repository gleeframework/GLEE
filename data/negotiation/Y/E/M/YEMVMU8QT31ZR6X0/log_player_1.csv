"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. I believe this will encourage Bob to engage in further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's a reasonable offer, and accepting it ensures a sale without the risk of further negotiation."
