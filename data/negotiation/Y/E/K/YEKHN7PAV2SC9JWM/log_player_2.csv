Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is your top limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $675,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for you, Bob!  You are getting the product for significantly less than your $1,200,000 maximum and getting it at a price you are comfortable with. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
