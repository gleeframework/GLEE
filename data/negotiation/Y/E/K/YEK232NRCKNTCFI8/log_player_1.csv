"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the estimated value to Bob ($150), giving him room to negotiate.
* **Room for negotiation:**  A price of $140 leaves room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive and friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $130 for the product?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  $130 is still above my minimum value of $120.  This means I'm not in a rush to accept his offer.
* **Potential for better price:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he expressed interest in the product.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm confident in the product's value and keeps the negotiation going.  

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go lower than $135.  This would still be a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130.
* **Justifying the price:**  I highlight the value of the product to make it clear why $135 is a fair price.
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also clear about my minimum acceptable price."
