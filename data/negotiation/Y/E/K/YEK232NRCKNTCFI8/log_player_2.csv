"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's under your maximum budget of $150, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($120). This suggests room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $130 for the product? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $130 is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $140, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses interest in the product while highlighting your desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go lower than $135.  This would still be a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:** $135 is only $15 more than what Alice considers the product's worth and is only $15 less than your maximum budget. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already in round 3, and with 10 rounds total, time is running out.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price but also risks losing the deal. 
* **Avoiding John's higher price:**  While you could continue negotiating, buying from John for $150 would be a worse outcome. 

This offer provides a good balance of getting a fair price while minimizing risk."
