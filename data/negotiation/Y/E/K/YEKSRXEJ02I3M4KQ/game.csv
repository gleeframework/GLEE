"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,100,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm still open to negotiating. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
