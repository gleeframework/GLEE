"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to be a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to drop to $925,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
