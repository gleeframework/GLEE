"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd still find it a good value.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a sense that we're not very far apart.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This is a fair price, and would allow us both to come away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me at that price?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
