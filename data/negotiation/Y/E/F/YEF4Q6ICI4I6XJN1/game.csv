"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it, and it gives me a fair return.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to cover my costs.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
