Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $975,000.  This is a good compromise and shows our commitment to finding a deal.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is consistently moving closer to our desired price point.  He's showing a willingness to negotiate, but we need to hold firm to maximize our profit.  We have room to counter and still stay above his perceived value of $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer to demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done.  I'll come down to $1,000,000 even.  This is my best and final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's strategic to introduce a sense of urgency now by stating this is our ""best and final offer"".  This might encourage Bob to make a larger concession in the next round.  We've also chosen a clean and firm number ($1,000,000) to further emphasize the seriousness of this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to pay $925,000,  This is a significant move on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob has made a significant jump, we're only two rounds away from potentially losing our guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. The risk of continuing with Bob outweighs the potential reward at this stage. We need to push Bob to his absolute limit in the next round to see if he's genuinely willing to meet us closer to our desired price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my final offer of $1,000,000 stands.  This product is worth every penny and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.  I need a decision now, otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're sticking to our guns and reiterating our ""final offer."" We're also introducing a sense of urgency by telling Bob we need a decision now. This puts the ball firmly in his court and forces him to make a choice: accept our offer or risk losing the deal altogether. By not budging and emphasizing the time constraint, we're maximizing our chances of getting Bob to agree to the $1,000,000 price."
