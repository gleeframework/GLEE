"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $8,000. Considering its high quality and unique features, I am proposing an initial price of $7,200. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,200 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $7,200 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $6,500 for this product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 6500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value of the product and my costs, I cannot agree to the $6,500 price. However, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $6,800 for the product. I hope this meets within your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $7,200 to $6,800, which is a significant reduction. 
*  Bob's target price is $6,500, so $6,800 is only $300 more.
* It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a small reduction in price.
* Buying from John would cost $8,000, so this is a much better deal.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $6,800 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point."
