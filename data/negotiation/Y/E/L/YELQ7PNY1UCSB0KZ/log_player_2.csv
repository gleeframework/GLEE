"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start the negotiation at $95. We believe this is a fair price given its worth to both of us. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, based on our costs and the value we place on the product, we need to adjust our offer slightly. We're proposing $90 as our next step. This still allows us to cover our expenses while acknowledging your budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable, or if you'd like to propose another amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $90 is still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my $85 counteroffer."
