"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start the negotiation at $95. We believe this is a fair price given its worth to both of us. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different amount.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let me know if you're open to this.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, based on our costs and the value we place on the product, we need to adjust our offer slightly. We're proposing $90 as our next step. This still allows us to cover our expenses while acknowledging your budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable, or if you'd like to propose another amount.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $88? It's a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
