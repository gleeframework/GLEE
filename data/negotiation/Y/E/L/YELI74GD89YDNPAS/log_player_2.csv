"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the competitive pricing. However, I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still ensuring Bob gets a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price point.  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or even Alice pulling back the offer entirely. It's more beneficial for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
