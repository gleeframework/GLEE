"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering your value for it is $800,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad you think the product is a good deal for me at $800,000. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on it. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good value for you, and it's closer to the value you've mentioned.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to my initial assessment. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still within my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a compromise that's closer to your latest offer. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
