"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range. You can potentially save a significant amount by negotiating further. While buying from John is a safe option, it's not the most economical choice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering your value for it is $800,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad you think the product is a good deal for me at $800,000. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on it. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good value for you, and it's closer to the value you've mentioned. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your ideal price. There's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. Buying from John is still the safest option, but you're still losing a significant amount of money by doing so."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to my initial assessment. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still within my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a compromise that's closer to your latest offer. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $950,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are small. Accepting this offer gets you the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer, and is a good deal considering your desired price range."
