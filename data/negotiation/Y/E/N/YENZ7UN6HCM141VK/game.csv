"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $12000. This is a good price considering its value to me, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $9500? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
