"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I see you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
