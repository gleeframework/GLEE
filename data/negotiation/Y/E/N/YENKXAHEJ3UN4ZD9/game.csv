"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  That's a fair price that still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go below $12000.  Let's consider this my final offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",12000.0,Alice,5,
