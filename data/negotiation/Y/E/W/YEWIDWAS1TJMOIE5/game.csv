"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started: $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $810,000?",810000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $810,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and go with $780,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a decent sale.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I need to make a bit more profit to justify the deal. How about we compromise at $795,000? It's a slight increase from your offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $795,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $790,000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $797,500? It's a slight increase from your offer, but I'm confident it's still a reasonable compromise for both of us.",797500.0,Alice,7,
