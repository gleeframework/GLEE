{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $810,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

While $810,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high.  I'd like to see if I can get Alice down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $810,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and go with $780,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a decent sale."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I need to make a bit more profit to justify the deal. How about we compromise at $795,000? It's a slight increase from your offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $795,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $795,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $790,000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 790000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $797,500? It's a slight increase from your offer, but I'm confident it's still a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $797,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $797,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $797,500 is getting close, I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and Alice doesn't seem to be budging much further.  It's getting risky to keep pushing since I have limited rounds.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option at this point."
