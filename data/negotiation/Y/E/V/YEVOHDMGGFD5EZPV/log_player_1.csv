Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation down while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message implies the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on factors like risk tolerance and how much we know about Bob's negotiation style."
