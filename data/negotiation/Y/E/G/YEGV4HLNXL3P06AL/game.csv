"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $8,200 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $8,300. This is a final offer from me.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",8300.0,Alice,5,
