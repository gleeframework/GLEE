Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired price range. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, hopefully showing him I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum, but I'm not willing to go through another round of negotiation. Since John is also offering my minimum, I'll sell to him to avoid further haggling."
