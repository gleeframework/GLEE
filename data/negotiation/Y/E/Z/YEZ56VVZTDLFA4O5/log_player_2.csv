"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  
* **Negotiation is worth trying:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to potentially get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to sell at $1,500,000 gives you a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle ground:** It's halfway between Alice's minimum ($1,200,000) and a price you're comfortable with ($1,300,000). 
* **Setting the stage:**  A lower opening counteroffer allows for more room to negotiate upwards in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has lowered her price considerably from the initial offer, and this price is within a reasonable range for you.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice could become less willing to compromise.  
* **Time is a factor:**  You're already three rounds in, and further negotiation could eat into your time and potentially lead to a higher price from John.

**Conclusion:** Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's good for you, without risking a higher price from John or further delays."
