"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's value and my target profit margin. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to make a significant concession, and I appreciate that. However, $725,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $900,000, which would be $812,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $812,500, and it's clear you're not going to get a significantly better deal from her.  Taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John makes the most sense at this point."
