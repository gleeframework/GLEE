Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a high price, but I'm leaving some room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to accept a lower price if it means securing a sale quickly. I'm also aware that Bob might be willing to pay more, and I want to leave some room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I'll also be watching the clock. If negotiations drag on too long, I'll switch to John, who is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $1,200,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This is my counteroffer to Bob. I've lowered my price from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise.  I'm confident the product is worth more than this, but I'm trying to find a price that is both fair to me and attractive to Bob.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to entice Bob to accept, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price. While it's still less than what I initially hoped for, I'm willing to accept it.  Negotiating further might take more time and could risk Bob backing out completely.  I need to weigh the potential for a higher price against the risk of losing this deal and having to settle for John's offer.  

Since $1,250,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal, I'll accept Bob's offer."
