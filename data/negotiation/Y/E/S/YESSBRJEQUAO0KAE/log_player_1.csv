Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from another party."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high to test Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and demand, justifying the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency with the ""limited-time offer"" and ""other party"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You secure a significantly higher profit than selling to John.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while ensuring you don't miss out on a sale."
