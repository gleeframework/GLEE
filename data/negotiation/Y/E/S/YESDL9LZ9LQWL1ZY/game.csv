"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. How about $9,900? This is the highest I can go without going over my budget.",9900.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $10,000. Let's split the difference. How about $10,200?  This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your desire to stay above $10,000, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,200. How about $9,850? This is the highest I can go without going over my budget.",9850.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting close. How about $10,000? This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",10000.0,Alice,7,
