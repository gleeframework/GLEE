Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 

If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option, knowing I can always sell to him for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I will aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $20,000, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer is the best course of action, as it maximizes my profit while avoiding further negotiation."
