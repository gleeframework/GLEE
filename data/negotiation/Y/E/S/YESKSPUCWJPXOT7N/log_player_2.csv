"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, as I'm confident you'll find it worth at least $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, the best option is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $10,000."
