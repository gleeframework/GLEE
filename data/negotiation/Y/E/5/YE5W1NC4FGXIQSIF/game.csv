"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum.  Let's try $8,900.  This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 one more time. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
