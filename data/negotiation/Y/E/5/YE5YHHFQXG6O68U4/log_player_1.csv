Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,500,000 without pushing Bob to reject the offer outright. Leaving some profit margin for Bob can make him more likely to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will far exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Confident, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 leaves you with a $350,000 profit above your minimum and gives Bob a potential $150,000 gain if he utilizes the product to its full value.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Relationship:**  While maximizing profit is key, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable. Sometimes, a slightly lower price can lead to future opportunities."
