"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,090,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
