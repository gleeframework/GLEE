,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $145.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $152.50? This still allows us to cover our costs while offering you a fair deal.",152.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $140? I'm willing to make a decision today if we can meet at this price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're looking for a good deal, Bob. Considering your last offer, I think we can come to an agreement at $147.50. This price still ensures a reasonable profit for us while being competitive in the market. I hope this works for you.",147.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $147.50, so how about we try $142.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",142.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I would need to maintain a small margin. How about we settle at $145? This price offers a good balance between your budget and our needs.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further. I'm willing to meet you at $140, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to make a decision today.",140.0,Bob,8,
