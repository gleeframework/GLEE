Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it's worth $1,450,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,450,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **High But Believable:** The offer should be high to maximize profit but still within a range Bob might consider reasonable.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
