"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it's worth $1,450,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to:

* **Negotiate:** Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. 
* **Fall back on John:** If Alice doesn't budge, you can always accept John's offer, ensuring you still get the product.

You have a better chance of saving money by rejecting this initial offer."
