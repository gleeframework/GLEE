Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves you room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher price might make Bob immediately walk away.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

* **Counter-offer is lower than my previous offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Friendly message:** Emphasizes the idea of a mutually beneficial compromise.

This counter-offer gives Bob a chance to agree, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge significantly. I've already made several concessions, and his final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To avoid potentially further rounds of fruitless negotiations, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get the price I want and avoids the risk of Bob's continued lowballing."
