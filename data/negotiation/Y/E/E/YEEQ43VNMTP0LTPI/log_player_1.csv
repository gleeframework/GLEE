"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for that.  I'll make another counteroffer in hopes of reaching an agreement closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to bridge the gap here.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal considering what the product is worth to you.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob is getting closer to my price, but I'm concerned that we're getting into a back-and-forth that might not end well. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk not getting a final agreement with Bob."
