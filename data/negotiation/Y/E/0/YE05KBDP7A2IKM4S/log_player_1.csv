Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the price reflects the product's worth, I'm subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While I have John as a backup, I don't want to reveal this to Bob. It weakens my negotiating position. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also understand the importance of reaching a mutually agreeable deal."
