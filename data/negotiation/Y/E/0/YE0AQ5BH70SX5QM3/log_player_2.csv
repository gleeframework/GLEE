"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $100 is better than $120, you can do better. You have a clear alternative with John at $80.  Rejecting gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $80.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $92.50?  That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92.5 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still above your target price. You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, so you should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  I'm still aiming to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price.  I'm willing to go down a bit more, how about $90?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum budget.  Since you have a guaranteed option with John at $80, it's best to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
