{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. My initial price is $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford $900,000 right now. Would you consider lowering the price? I propose $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, I think I can get a bit more. I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  Let's split the difference - how about $875,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is closer to what I can afford, I still feel we could reach a better agreement. How about $860,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'd prefer a bit more, I think $860,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale."
