{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win situation where I earn more than my minimum and Bob gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to earn more, it's better to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
