"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $80. It allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $78 is still below that point.  I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm counteroffering with $82. This is a further compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Even though Bob is getting closer with his offer of $79, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it's getting close to the end of the allotted rounds.  It's now more beneficial to sell to John for $80 and secure a guaranteed sale. This is my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation."
