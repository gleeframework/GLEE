"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $14000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value:** Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, but is offering $14,000. This indicates she has room to negotiate.
* **Your goal is to save money:** You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer that is lower than $14,000 but higher than $12,000. This will give Alice some room to negotiate while still getting you a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I can do $13500, which is the lowest I can go. I think it's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still lower than John's price:**  You can get the product for $13,500 from Alice, which is $1,500 cheaper than John's price.
* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:** Alice has already lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,500.  It's likely that she is firm on this price. 

**Next Steps:**

You're getting a good deal, so accepting the offer makes sense.  You're saving money compared to John and the negotiation is likely over."
