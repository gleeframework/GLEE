"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you need to push for a significantly lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a price you're comfortable with."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you, while being more aligned with your budget.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit.  I want to keep pushing for a lower price and see if I can negotiate further.  There's still room to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows me to continue the process."

While Alice is coming down,  $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm not willing to go that high.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if she'll come down further."
