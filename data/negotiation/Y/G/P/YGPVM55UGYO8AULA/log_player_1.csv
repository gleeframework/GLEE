Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant profit for you, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value for Bob. 
* This strategy aims to:
    * Secure a high initial price
    *  Encourage Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a higher final price.

**Important Note:**  As Alice, I'm playing the role of a smart negotiator. My goal is to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware of the risk of losing the deal. I'm willing to negotiate and be flexible, but I won't settle for less than my minimum value of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than $8,000, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob. I'm also factoring in the possibility that Bob might become more flexible if he sees that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500** is a reasonable compromise. It's a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* The message remains positive and friendly, emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect. 
* This strategy aims to:
    * Show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
    *  Maintain a higher price point than Bob's offer. 
    * Encourage Bob to accept, realizing that he's getting closer to his desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle and go with $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, Bob's offer is very close to my desired profit margin. Accepting his offer at $10,000 is a good compromise, securing a decent profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a deal with John at $8,000. It's a smart move to lock in this profit and finalize the deal."
