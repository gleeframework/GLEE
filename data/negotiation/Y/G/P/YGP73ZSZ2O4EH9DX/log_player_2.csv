Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me closer to the middle. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $14,000.  It's unlikely she'll budge further, and we have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best price."
