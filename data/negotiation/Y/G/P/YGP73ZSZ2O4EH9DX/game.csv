"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I believe my offer of $9,500 is reasonable.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000. This is my final offer as it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me closer to the middle. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,
