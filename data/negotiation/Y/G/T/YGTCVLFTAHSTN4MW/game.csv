"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $95?  That's a fair price considering its value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While $95 is closer, I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $70 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",80.0,Alice,5,
