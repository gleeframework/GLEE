,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you and is a good starting point for further discussion. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $787,500. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize the deal at this price.",787500.0,Alice,7,
