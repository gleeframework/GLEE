"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate. This is a common strategy to maximize profit while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I will reject his offer and attempt to counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John right now would be giving up potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you and is a good starting point for further discussion. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll try to counteroffer again in the next round.  Selling to John now would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price while emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This counteroffer is a strong middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $750,000, which is a significant investment on my end. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. Selling to John now would mean missing out on potentially more profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $787,500. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while demonstrating I'm serious about closing the deal."
