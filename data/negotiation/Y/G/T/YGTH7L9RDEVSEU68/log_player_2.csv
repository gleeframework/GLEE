{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $14,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, and starting with a significant counteroffer is a good strategy. Offering $11,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, Bob is determined to get the best deal possible.  He can still potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 matches Bob's maximum budget. Accepting this offer is the best strategy as it allows Bob to acquire the product without exceeding his budget. While there's always the chance of getting a slightly lower price, the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or a higher price outweighs the potential gain.  Furthermore, Bob can always choose to buy from John at the same price if the negotiations fail."
