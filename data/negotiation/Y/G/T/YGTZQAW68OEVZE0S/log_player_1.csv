Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but $130 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
At this point, it's better to take Bob's offer of $115.  It's more than you'd get from John, and further negotiation might risk Bob walking away entirely."
