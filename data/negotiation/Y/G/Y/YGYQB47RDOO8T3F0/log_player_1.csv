Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Being friendly:**  I'm starting the conversation with a friendly message to build rapport.
* **Adding a reason:** I'm implying the product is valuable to Bob, which might make him more willing to pay.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while remaining open to negotiation. I'm also prepared to sell to John for $80 if Bob doesn't agree to a price that works for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better. By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer with a slightly higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm not able to go down to $80 just yet. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $80,  making him consider the value proposition. 
* **Maintain friendly tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive to keep the negotiation going smoothly.

This strategy aims to reach a middle ground while keeping the price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This allows me to stay within my budget while still getting a good value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's also a good deal for him, considering the product is worth $120 to him.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
