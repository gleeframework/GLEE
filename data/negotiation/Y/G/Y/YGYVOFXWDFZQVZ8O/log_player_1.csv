"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150. I have 9 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $125. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit above my budget at $125.  How about we split the difference and I pay $112.50? I'm really hoping to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $125, I've only got 6 rounds left. It's more likely Bob won't budge much further, and I risk losing a deal entirely.  $112.50 is a good compromise and a decent profit for me."
