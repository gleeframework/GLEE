"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really value.  It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, closer to her perceived value of $80.  You can then decide if it's worth accepting or going with John's $100 offer."
