"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $1,000,000 undervalues its true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground, but $1,100,000 is still quite a way from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great fit for this product.  My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you see the value in it.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
