Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""potential"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob that its value could be even higher than what he currently perceives.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

My goal is to understand how much Bob is willing to pay and then strategically move towards a price that benefits me while still being acceptable to him.  I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $1,000,000 undervalues its true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I want to keep the negotiation amicable and acknowledge his offer while still making it clear I'm aiming higher.
* **Strategic Counter:** I'm moving down from my initial price, but not drastically.  The $1,700,000 counteroffer is:
    * Still significantly above Bob's offer, giving me room to negotiate further.
    * Comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), ensuring a profit if he accepts.
    * Above Bob's perceived value, but presented as a compromise to encourage him to engage. 

My goal is to move the negotiation toward a price closer to $1,500,000 without losing Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer slightly to $1,100,000, but it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. While he's moving in the right direction, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I can't get closer to my target.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground, but $1,100,000 is still quite a way from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great fit for this product.  My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm signaling my willingness to walk away by mentioning the other buyer, adding a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm putting the ball firmly in Bob's court. 
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm dropping my price to $1,450,000, a small concession to show flexibility but staying very close to my absolute minimum.  

This approach aims to incentivize Bob to accept my offer while preserving my ability to walk away and sell to John for my desired price."
