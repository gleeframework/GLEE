I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and I'm confident I can get more than my minimum of $12,000.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $15,000.  This is still above my minimum of $12,000, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob than his $10,000 offer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round, so I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
