Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,600,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the same as what John is offering, so I'll accept it and close the deal."
