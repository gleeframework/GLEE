{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While still below my initial ask, $1,775,000 is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to push for a higher price with Bob risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer secures a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price and avoids the potential of missing out on a deal altogether."
