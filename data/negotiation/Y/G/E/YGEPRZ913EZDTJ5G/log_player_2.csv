"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for cheaper than $12,000.  Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and you want to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Alice's minimum:** Alice values the product at $10,000, so she's unlikely to accept anything significantly lower.
* **Your maximum:** You're willing to pay $15,000, but want to save as much as possible.
* **Negotiation strategy:** A counteroffer of $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. It shows you're serious about buying, but also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to go lower. 

This counteroffer is a good balance between potentially getting a good deal and not risking losing the product to another seller."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than what you want to pay.  You want to save as much money as possible, and you're willing to negotiate further. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her counteroffer is still above your desired price point. By offering $11,000, you're demonstrating your commitment to getting a deal but also staying within your budget. This counteroffer represents a further compromise while still leaving room for a potential final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is getting closer to your maximum budget of $15,000, but it's still not a deal you're happy with.  You've already made a counteroffer and she's not budging much, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitless.  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $15,000.  You'll avoid further negotiation and still stay within your budget."
