"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $117.50? I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $117.50.  How about we meet in the middle at $116?  That's a fair price for both of us.",116.0,Bob,4,
