{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly below what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. It also expresses a belief in fairness, which might encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get the product at a good price and still ensuring I get a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
