Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will match that price.
* **Direct Approach:** Offering a clear price upfront avoids unnecessary back and forth. 
* **Justification:**  While optional, briefly mentioning the product's value to Bob might make him more receptive to the offer.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer as it's higher than his perceived value. However, by starting at your desired price, you leave no money on the table."
