,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $950,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However,  $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This offer represents a significant value for you, considering the product's worth to you is even higher.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I still think $920,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
