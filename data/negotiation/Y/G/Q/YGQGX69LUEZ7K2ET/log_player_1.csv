Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $9,500 allows for some potential back and forth without immediately going below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John is a strong backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I get my minimum value.

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, leaving some room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above his initial price and significantly above my minimum. This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my value.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I highlight the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain pressure:** By mentioning my willingness to come down, I subtly imply that this is my final offer and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Keep John in mind:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly the midpoint between his initial offer of $7,000 and my last counteroffer of $8,500.  This indicates a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Minimizing risk:** While $8,000 is still below my ideal price, it's significantly better than my minimum of $10,000 and ensures I don't lose out completely on the sale.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  This agreement avoids further back-and-forth, saving time and potentially preventing a stalemate.

Accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy at this point, as it secures a sale while minimizing potential loss and unnecessary negotiations."
