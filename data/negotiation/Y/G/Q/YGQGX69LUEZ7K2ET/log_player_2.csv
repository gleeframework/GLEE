"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price, especially since we have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the price as close to $6,000 as possible, so we start with a significantly lower counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows room for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a good rapport can be helpful in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to our acceptable range, but we're still above what John is offering.  There's room for Alice to come down further, so we'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counter-offer aims to find a compromise. It acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price that works for us.
* **John's Price as Leverage:** We've now reached the price point where John is an alternative. While we don't explicitly mention John, Alice might be aware that we have other options. 
* **Firm but Fair:** We're being firm about our budget but maintaining a polite and respectful tone."
