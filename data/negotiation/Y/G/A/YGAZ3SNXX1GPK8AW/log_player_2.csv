"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that holds immense value for me. I believe it could be equally valuable to you, given its unique capabilities. I'm willing to part with it for $1000000. This is a significant price, but it reflects the true worth of the product. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
