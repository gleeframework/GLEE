"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $110. Is this something you'd like to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's less than what John is charging, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $108. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

Alice's offer of $108 is a good compromise.  It's still lower than what John is selling it for, and it's closer to your desired price."
