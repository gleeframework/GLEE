"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is my best offer and a fair reflection of its value.  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $962,500? This is a fair offer considering your previous price and my previous offer.",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. I'm willing to be flexible, but $962,500 is still below what I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I'll come down to $1,025,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still quite interested in the product, but $1,025,000 is pushing my budget.  Could you meet me at $993,750? This splits the difference between our last two offers and feels like a fair deal for both of us.",993750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you've been persistent, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this quality and potential.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
