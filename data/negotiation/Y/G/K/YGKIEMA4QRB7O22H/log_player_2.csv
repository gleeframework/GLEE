# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000, a price that reflects its worth.  What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is my best offer and a fair reflection of its value.  Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. I'm willing to be flexible, but $962,500 is still below what I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I'll come down to $1,025,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been persistent, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this quality and potential.

{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $1,000,000. She's stated this is her ""final offer"" and her tone suggests she's unlikely to budge significantly.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice won't budge and you'll miss out on buying from John at $1,000,000."
