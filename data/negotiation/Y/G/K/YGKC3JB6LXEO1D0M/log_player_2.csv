"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to my maximum budget than her minimum price. I should counteroffer significantly lower to see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but she only came down $10.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away unless she moves closer to my price range. I'll counteroffer slightly higher than my last offer, but still well below her current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a price I'm happy with. While I could try to negotiate further, $125 is a reasonable compromise and a good price.  It's not worth the risk of her walking away or me running out of rounds."
