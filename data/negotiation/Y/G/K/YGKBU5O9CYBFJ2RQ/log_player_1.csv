Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal while still allowing you to maximize your profit. This is a common negotiation tactic â€“ start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate the price down further. Be prepared to consider a counter-offer, but always keep your minimum price of $100 in mind."
