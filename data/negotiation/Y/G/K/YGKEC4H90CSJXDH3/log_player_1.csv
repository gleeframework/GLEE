Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price. Accepting guarantees I make a significant profit and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation where Bob might lower his offer or I might miss out on selling to John."
