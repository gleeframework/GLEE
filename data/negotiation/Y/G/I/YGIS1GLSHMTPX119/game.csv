,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us. ",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,750 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,375. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $8,375 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it'll save us both some time.",9000.0,Alice,5,
