"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm confident it will be of great benefit to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the value of the product. Let's close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the value, I'm aiming for a price point of $1,275,000. This takes into account the significant benefits the product offers. I'm confident this is a deal where we both come out ahead.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm feeling the pressure, but $1,275,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, which is a very close to my maximum budget. This is a very fair price considering the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
