Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will match that price. 
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning another buyer, you introduce a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Direct Approach:** Offering the product at your desired price from the start is a strong tactic. While there's a chance Bob might reject it, it leaves no money on the table if he accepts."
