"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $11000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $10,500 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both close to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, which would be $10750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my price, the offer of $10,750 is still too low. I've had enough of this negotiation and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob. I'll sell to John to ensure I at least get my minimum asking price."
