"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $11000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me too.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $10500 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both close to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, which would be $10750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,6,
