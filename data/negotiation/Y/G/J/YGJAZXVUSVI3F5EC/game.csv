"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
