"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is truly exceptional and holds significant value for someone like yourself. This product, which I am confident you will find invaluable, is worth $800,000 to you based on our discussions. My proposal is to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true worth while also ensuring a fair return for me. Therefore, I would like to extend an offer to purchase this product for $950,000.

This price not only compensates me adequately for the investment and value I have placed in this product but also leaves room for you to enjoy substantial savings compared to its market value. I understand that decisions of this nature require careful consideration, and I am more than willing to discuss any concerns or questions you might have regarding the product or the offer.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I look forward to the possibility of working together to make this transaction a reality.

Best regards,
Alice
