"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price range.  You have the opportunity to negotiate further, and there's a chance Alice might come down in price. It's too early to buy from John as you haven't exhausted your negotiation options with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down a bit, she's still above your desired price range. You have more room to negotiate, and rejecting this offer keeps your negotiating power. Buying from John at this point is not the best option as you have more rounds to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your need for profit, Alice.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,100,000. This would allow you to make a good profit and would be within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,175,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your price, but $1,175,000 is still above your budget. You have a few more rounds left to try and get a lower price. It's still too early to buy from John, as there's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a fair compromise and keeps us both in a reasonable profit margin. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,162,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,162,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price under $1,150,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and allows us to close this sale."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking $1,157,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting very close to your desired price, you have one more round to negotiate with her.  There's still a chance you can get her to come down to $1,150,000. Buying from John at this point isn't a good idea because you could potentially save more by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 10
