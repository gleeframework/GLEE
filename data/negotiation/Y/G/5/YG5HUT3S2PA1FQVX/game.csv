"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
