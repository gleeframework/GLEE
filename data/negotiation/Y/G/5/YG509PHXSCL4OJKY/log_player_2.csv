# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great deal for you at a price of $150. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your $80 limit.  You can get the product for a much better price from John."
