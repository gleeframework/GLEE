"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. I'm really interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $7000? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $7600? It's a fair price that shows both of us are serious about making this deal work.",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7600 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a price of $7800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $7800 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $7500? I believe this would be a fair compromise that allows us to close the deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7500. I can offer you a price of $7700. This is my final compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",7700.0,Alice,7,
