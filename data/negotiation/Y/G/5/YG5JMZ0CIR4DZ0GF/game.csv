"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I expected given its potential value.  I'm willing to offer $1200000.  This shows my serious interest, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
