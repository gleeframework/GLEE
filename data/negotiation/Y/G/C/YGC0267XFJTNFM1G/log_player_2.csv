"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm looking to sell it for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
