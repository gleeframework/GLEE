# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, you have room to negotiate further.  You're looking to save as much as possible and can afford to go another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a slight improvement, you're still aiming for a price closer to $125.  There's still room to negotiate and you're not yet in a position to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get it for closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference and go with $130. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $132. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $132, which is very close to your target of $125. You've already rejected a few offers and it's likely Alice won't go much lower. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's better to secure the deal at this price rather than risk losing it or having to buy from John at a higher cost."
