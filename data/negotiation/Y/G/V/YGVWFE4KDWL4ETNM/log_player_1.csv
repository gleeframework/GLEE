"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal.  
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer serves as a gauge of Bob's interest and provides insight into his valuation of the product.  His response will guide our next move.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the option to walk away and sell to John for our minimum acceptable price, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is above his perceived value ($1,200,000) which indicates room for negotiation.
* Accepting his offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table compared to John's guaranteed offer.

We'll aim to negotiate closer to our desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the value this product brings warrants a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer to signal flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Holding Firm:** However, the new price is still substantially above both Bob's offer and his perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We're emphasizing the inherent value of the product to justify the higher price. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through rounds, we'll need to decide how much further to push for a higher price before time becomes a significant factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now significantly above John's standing offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a substantial profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now also means receiving the payment sooner, which has its own advantages."
