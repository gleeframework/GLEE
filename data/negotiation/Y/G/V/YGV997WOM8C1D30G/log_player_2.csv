While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. However, it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to push for a price closer to $1,250,000."
