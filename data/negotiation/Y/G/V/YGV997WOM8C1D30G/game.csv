"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value it holds for me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident in the value this product holds, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
