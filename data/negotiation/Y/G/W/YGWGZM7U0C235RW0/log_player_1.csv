"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still maximizing my potential profit.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm not afraid to push for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have plenty of rounds left and the option to sell to John, so there's no rush to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility.  However, it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also making it clear that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating to try to reach a price that is closer to my target. I'm not in a rush to close the deal and have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm willing to keep exploring options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing my willingness to close the deal. However, it is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, even after showing flexibility in my counteroffers. While we've made some progress, it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that meets my needs within the remaining rounds.

Rather than risk further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a swift and secure transaction."
