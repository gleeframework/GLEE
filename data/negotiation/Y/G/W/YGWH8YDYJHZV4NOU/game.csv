"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is still a great deal, and I believe you'll find it worth the investment. Let's work together to find a price we're both comfortable with.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $15000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",15000.0,Bob,4,
