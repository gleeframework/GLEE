"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point considering the product's value to Bob.  I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards, but I want to establish a strong position from the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, selling for $1,000,000 would mean a significant loss for me. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation.  I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. Selling for $1,100,000 would still mean taking a loss. I'm going to counteroffer again. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This price is a small step down from my previous offer, showing flexibility. However, it's still above my minimum value and closer to what I'm hoping to achieve.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm trying to find a compromise that both Bob and I can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to push for a higher amount, we're nearing the end of our negotiations.  It's a bit of a loss for me, but I'm willing to accept it to close the deal.  It's better than selling to John for my minimum value."
