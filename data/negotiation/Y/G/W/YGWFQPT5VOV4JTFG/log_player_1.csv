Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $135 creates a perceived ""discount"" while still ensuring a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum.

This approach balances maximizing potential profit from Bob with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
