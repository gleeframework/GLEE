"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $900000 is still too far below my minimum. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1050000?  It's a fair price that considers both our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here. We're both willing to compromise, but the gap is still too large.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to offer the product for $1000000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to lose hope that we can reach an agreement.  I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $975000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.  If you're serious about buying this product, I urge you to consider this offer carefully.",975000.0,Alice,7,
