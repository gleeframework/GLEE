"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I believe this is fair considering the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I think this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,250. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
