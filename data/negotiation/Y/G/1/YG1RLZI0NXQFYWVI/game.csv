"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get the product for a price closer to $850,000. This would still give you a substantial profit and leave me with a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant saving from the full value and allows me to earn a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for $875,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing for a decent profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's try to reach a final agreement on this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
