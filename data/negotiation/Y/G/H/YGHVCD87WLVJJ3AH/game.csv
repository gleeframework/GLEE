"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $975,000. I think we can find a mutually beneficial deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can't go any higher than $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product for both of us. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $975,000 again, or I'm open to considering $950,000. I want to make sure we find a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions. I believe we can close this deal if we're willing to meet each other halfway.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm very close to accepting your offer. To close the deal, I'm prepared to offer $940,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",940000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $940,000. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.
