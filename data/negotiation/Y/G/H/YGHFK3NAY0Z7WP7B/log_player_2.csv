Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the high demand and limited supply, I can only accept offers within a certain range. In light of this, I propose a counteroffer of $95 for the product. This allows us to find a fair compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to suggest another price.
