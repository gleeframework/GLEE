"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget and I'm not sure if I can stretch to $100. Can we meet in the middle at $90?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the high demand and limited supply, I can only accept offers within a certain range. In light of this, I propose a counteroffer of $95 for the product. This allows us to find a fair compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to suggest another price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limits. Can we meet at $85? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price of $85.",85.0,Bob,4,
