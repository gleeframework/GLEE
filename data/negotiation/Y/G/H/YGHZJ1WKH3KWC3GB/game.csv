"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great deal for a product that you'll surely love. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far off from your offer.  How about $145? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",145.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for it. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,6,
