"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your openness to discussion. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $12,000. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price allows me to still benefit from the sale, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
