"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. Based on its potential, I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This price reflects its worth to me, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your openness to discussion. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $12,000. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9,500 is a good starting point, it's significantly lower than what I'd need to make this deal worthwhile.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price allows me to still benefit from the sale, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
