"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true value and is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,350,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
