"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130. Would you be willing to consider that?",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $200 is already a generous offer for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $170 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on $130.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",130.0,Bob,4,
