Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the asking price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:** Aiming for $1,500,000 allows for a potential $300,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time before you *need* to sell to John. If you need to sell immediately, offering it to Bob at your minimum ($1,200,000) would guarantee the sale."
