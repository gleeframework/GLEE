"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $12000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and you have room to bargain before hitting your $15,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,000, which is a decent compromise.  You're still saving $4,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John for a higher price is too great. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a good price within your budget."
