{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over Bob's budget and there's no reason to accept it in the first round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price. He has a backup option with John, and there's still room for negotiation with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

Bob should increase his offer to $13,800. This shows continued willingness to negotiate but still keeps him within his budget. It also puts the pressure back on Alice to consider a compromise.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has matched Bob's counteroffer, meaning there is no further room for negotiation.  While $13,800 is slightly above Bob's ideal price, it's still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John.  It's important to note that this is a negotiation, not a war.  Sometimes accepting a slightly higher price is the best way to secure the deal and move on."
