"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I value your offer,  $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and gives us both a chance to reach an agreement.  Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000 again, but this time I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
