"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's an excellent value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, you can potentially get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm looking to pay closer to $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose we settle on $105 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $110 price to $105, which is a significant move.  This is a good deal for you, as your goal was to save as much money as possible. Buying from John would cost you $120, so this offer is better.  There's always the risk of potentially getting a lower price with more negotiation, but it's a risk that isn't worth taking in this case."
