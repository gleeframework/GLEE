We're getting close, but it's still worth pushing Alice a bit further.  She's consistently meeting in the middle, so there's a chance to get the price down a little more."

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,040,000 at this point.  It's not worth the risk of her refusing another counteroffer and potentially losing the product or having to settle for a worse price. Buying from John guarantees the best price at $1,000,000."
