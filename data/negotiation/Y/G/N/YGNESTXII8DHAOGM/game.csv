"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm confident that you'll find this price reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value of this product, I can't justify going above $1,030,000. Let me know what you think.",1030000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,030,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,030,000, which would be $1,055,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1055000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to budge a little bit to get this deal done.  How about $1,040,000? That's a significant move on my end.",1040000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $1,040,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,055,000 and $1,040,000, which would be $1,047,500. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1047500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $1,035,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,047,500 and $1,035,000, which would be $1,041,250. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1041250.0,Alice,9,
