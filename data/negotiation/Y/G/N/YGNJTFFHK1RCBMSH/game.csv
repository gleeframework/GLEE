"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!",10800.0,Alice,5,
