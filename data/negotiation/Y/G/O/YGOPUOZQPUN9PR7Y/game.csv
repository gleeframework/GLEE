"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To start the conversation, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While I value your interest, the product's worth to you is undeniable, and $850,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. How about $875,000? That's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both happy.",875000.0,Bob,4,
