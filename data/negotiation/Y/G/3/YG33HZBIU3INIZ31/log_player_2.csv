"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so he should try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows for further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? That's my maximum budget for this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob's maximum budget is $10,500, and Alice's latest offer is $10,800. Even though this is a better price than her initial offer, it's still over Bob's budget.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, since it's below his budget and a guaranteed deal."
