"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll sell the product to you for $10,100. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,7,
