"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product, worth no less than $12000 to me. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you. I'll sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and quality.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I still need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $13000, but I'll throw in an additional feature that's worth $500. This brings the total price to $13500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional feature, but I'm still not willing to pay $13500. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to propose a different compromise. Can you consider selling the product to me for $13000, and throw in the additional feature as a separate item that I can purchase for $200? That way, I can still get the feature I want, but at a lower overall cost.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your creativity. However, I'm not willing to separate the feature from the product. I believe the feature is an integral part of the product's value. Instead, I'll meet you at $13000, but I'll throw in an additional feature that's worth $300. This brings the total price to $13300. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price.",13300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $13300. I'm willing to meet you at $12800, but I'd like to propose a final compromise. If you can throw in an additional feature worth at least $200, I'll consider purchasing the product at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I'm willing to throw in an additional feature worth $250, which brings the total price to $13050. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price. This is my final offer.",13050.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $13050. I'm willing to meet you at $12800, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product today. If you can accept this price, I'll sign the contract and finalize the deal.",12800.0,Bob,10,
