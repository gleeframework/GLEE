Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be positive and encouraging while highlighting the value proposition for Bob.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a relatively high price to maximize my potential profit.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation to allow Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop that low.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get closer to a price I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than $8,000, and I don't want to risk selling below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing my offer as a compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to reach a middle ground that is still acceptable to me while showing flexibility to Bob.
* This strategy aims to avoid a breakdown in negotiations and keep the deal moving forward."
