Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe that $90 would be a fair price for this product. I hope you can consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly coming up in price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $100. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting less from Bob."
