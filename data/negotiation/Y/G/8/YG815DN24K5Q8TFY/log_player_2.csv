{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, but still within a range that might be appealing to Alice. This offer signals Bob's serious interest in the product while putting pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a new counteroffer, potentially pushing Alice closer to his desired price.  Bob can continue to leverage the threat of buying from John to motivate Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now closer to his maximum price.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still attempting to save as much money as possible.  Bob is hoping that Alice, understanding his maximum budget, will accept this offer and close the deal."
