Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. This should be attractive to Bob, as it's still a better price than his estimated value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still a good deal for Bob, but also closer to my desired value. I hope this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to sell for closer to $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum value and ensures a sale.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting and me potentially losing the sale entirely outweighs the potential gain."
