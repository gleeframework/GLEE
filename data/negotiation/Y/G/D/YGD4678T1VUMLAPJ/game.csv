"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $17,000. This is my final compromise, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,
