Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $16,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $17,000. This is my final compromise, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still significantly higher than your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance you won't be able to get the price down to your acceptable range within the remaining rounds. 

Buying the product from John at $10,000 is the most financially sensible option at this point. It ensures you get the product within your budget and eliminates the risk of further negotiation complications."
