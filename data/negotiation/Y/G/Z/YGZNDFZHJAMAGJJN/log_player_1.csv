``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,200,000. I am prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you, but it's also the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're able to come up to this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't meet that price. I am willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer. If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still not a workable number for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be forced to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer. Unfortunately, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more reasonable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've made multiple concessions and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a better price. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale to John."
