,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,200,000. I am prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you, but it's also the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're able to come up to this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't meet that price. I am willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still not a workable number for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be forced to accept John's offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer. Unfortunately, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more reasonable for you.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
