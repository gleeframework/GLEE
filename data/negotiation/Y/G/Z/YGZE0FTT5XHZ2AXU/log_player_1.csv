"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what the product *is*.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's guaranteed offer in mind gives me leverage.  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests he's serious but also wants a ""good deal,"" implying he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to his perceived value but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and coming back with a proposal. While $1,500,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the unique value proposition this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate and makes it seem like I'm making a significant concession. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the ""unique value proposition"" without being specific, hoping to keep Bob anchored to a higher perceived value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's still engaging, his latest message suggests he might be more focused on getting a ""good deal"" than recognizing the product's true value. I'll hold firm to signal I'm serious and see if he's willing to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a strong return on your investment, but your current offer significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. I've been transparent about my position, and I need you to understand that $1,650,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair and final offer considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer communicates a sense of urgency and finality. I'm stating my position clearly and firmly while still leaving room for Bob to accept a price that's above my minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition without giving specifics. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm increasing the pressure by presenting this as a ""fair and final offer.""  This might push Bob to be more realistic in his counter-offer or accept if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe that $1,650,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be more confident in the deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, but I'm still interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is still significantly below my minimum price, and his latest offer shows minimal movement. This suggests he might be trying to drag out the negotiation or isn't willing to meet my valuation.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee Bob will meet this price, and further negotiation risks a lower final offer or a stalemate. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the opportunity cost of potentially closing a deal with John sooner. 

While there's a chance Bob might eventually agree to a price closer to my target, it's a risk I'm not willing to take given the current state of the negotiation and the guaranteed offer in hand.  It's time to move on to a buyer who recognizes the product's true value."
