"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase a unique and valuable product. It's something that I believe could be of great benefit to you, but I understand it might not be the right fit for everyone. My asking price is $20000. I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential value you could realize. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $15000. Please let me know your decision.",20000.0,Alice,1,
