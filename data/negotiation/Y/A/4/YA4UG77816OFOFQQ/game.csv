"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at $950,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
