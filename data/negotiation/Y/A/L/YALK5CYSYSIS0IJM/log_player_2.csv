"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the same as the price you can get from John. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting, you keep the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
