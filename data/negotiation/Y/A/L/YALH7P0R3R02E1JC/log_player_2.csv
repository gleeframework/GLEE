"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is less than the $120 John is offering, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There are 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's plenty of time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  It's still a fair price, as Bob is willing to pay more than the product is worth to Alice. This gives Alice room to negotiate without losing too much profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's a good deal for him.  He's already saved $15 from her initial offer, and it's only the third round. Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and potential for Alice to increase the price again.  It's also a better deal than buying from John for $120."
