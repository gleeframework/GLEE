Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to make a deal with Bob before moving on to John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable. Aiming too high risks Bob rejecting the offer, leaving you with the guaranteed $1,000,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a win-win, allowing you to benefit significantly while recognizing the asset's worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and value, framing the offer positively.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 gives you a $100,000 profit over your guarantee and leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain compared to his perceived value.
* **Win-Win Language:** The message positions the price as mutually beneficial, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,100,000.  You could offer a slightly lower price for a higher chance of acceptance, but that would mean sacrificing some potential profit."
