"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my initial target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my target. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're really making me work for this!  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $1,075,000 is still a bit rich for me.  Would you consider $1,060,000?  That's the best I can do.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make some concessions. However, I'm still not willing to budge too much from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,060,000. How about we try $1,067,500? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",1067500.0,Alice,7,
