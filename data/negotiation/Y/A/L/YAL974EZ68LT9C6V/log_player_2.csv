# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my initial target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my target. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make some concessions. However, I'm still not willing to budge too much from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,060,000. How about we try $1,067,500? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,067,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,067,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly sticking close to her price, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,067,500 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling."
