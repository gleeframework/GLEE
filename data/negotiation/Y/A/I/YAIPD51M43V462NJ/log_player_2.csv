"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170.

Round 3

Round 4

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good price, but I'm not willing to go below $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $143. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $120.  Alice has repeatedly rejected offers close to Bob's target price.  The negotiation has gone on long enough and there's a good chance they won't come to an agreement before the 10 rounds are up. John is a guaranteed source for the product at a price Bob is comfortable with."
