Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the unique nature of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my price range. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Would this be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose $1,180,000 as a potential price for the product. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While his offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price with a few more rounds.  I'm willing to risk losing a small amount to potentially gain a significant amount more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $1,210,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1210000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing the pressure a bit by aiming for a quick close.  This offer is still significantly above my minimum, but gives Bob a sense of getting a deal while leaving me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering the discussions we've had, I'd like to propose $1,190,000 as the final price for the product. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to close the deal and is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away in future rounds. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the difference isn't worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
