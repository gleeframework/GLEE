Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it profitable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, ensuring the negotiation continues. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that Bob might reject the offer, so I'm prepared to go to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $850,000 is better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting a better price and maintaining my leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. I believe this price allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** This counter-offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but not completely accepting it.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to sway Bob towards a higher price.
* **Mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's rationality.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further discussion, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a substantial amount and reflects the value I place on it. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. 
* **John is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price.  This gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for better outcome:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a final counteroffer that might convince Bob to agree. 
* **Closing the deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting my target price and potentially pushing him to make a final compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000.  However, I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer the product to you for $925,000. This price is a fair middle ground and allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This counter-offer is framed as my final compromise, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Fair middle ground:** I'm highlighting the compromise by presenting the price as a ""middle ground"" between our positions.
* **Threat of alternative:**  The message subtly threatens to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept, emphasizing the urgency and limited negotiation room. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that $925,000 is a good deal for him."
