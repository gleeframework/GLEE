"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it profitable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. I believe this price allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to your target of $800,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a substantial amount and reflects the value I place on it. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000.  However, I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer the product to you for $925,000. This price is a fair middle ground and allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice will not go lower than this price.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
