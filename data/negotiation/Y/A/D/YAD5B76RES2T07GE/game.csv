"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  I can't go as low as $10,500, but I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a fair price considering the value and the benefits you'll get from the product.  Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another seller.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,200 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs while giving you a great deal.  Let's close this deal. ",10500.0,Alice,5,
