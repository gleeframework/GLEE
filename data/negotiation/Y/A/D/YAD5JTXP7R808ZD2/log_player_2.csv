Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $9500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to go down to $10250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.
