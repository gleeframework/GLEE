Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is too low, but I'll see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to be flexible to reach a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $9500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your asking price and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for something a bit higher. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $9,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your original price, but $10250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's final offer of $10,000 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal with him. It's better than selling to John for the same price, as I've managed to secure the deal with Bob after several rounds of negotiations."
