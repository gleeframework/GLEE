Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell it for that right away. I believe the product is worth more and I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and a reasonable price point given my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum value. While I could counteroffer again, I'm worried the negotiation will go on indefinitely.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further risk of losing the sale."
