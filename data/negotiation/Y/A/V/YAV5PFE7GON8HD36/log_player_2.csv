"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always a good idea to start by rejecting an initial offer that's too high, especially when you have an alternative option like buying from John. You want to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1,200,000 is way outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows that you're serious about buying but also willing to push for a better deal.

* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a call to action, suggesting a willingness to continue the negotiation process."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
