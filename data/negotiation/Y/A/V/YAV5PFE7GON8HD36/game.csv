"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1200000 is way outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
