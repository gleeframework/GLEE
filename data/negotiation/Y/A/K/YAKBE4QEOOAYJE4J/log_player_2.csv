"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is still quite a bit above your target.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To make this work for me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. While she is willing to compromise, $950,000 is still a bit too much.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can push the price down further.  I still have a few rounds left, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price range, it's still a bit too high. I'm determined to get the best deal possible and I'm confident I can negotiate further.  I have several rounds left and still have the option of buying from John as a backup.  I'll try to push the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 910000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $910,000.  This is a good price, considering my target price and the fact that I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal.  While I could continue to try and negotiate for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer, or I'll run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
