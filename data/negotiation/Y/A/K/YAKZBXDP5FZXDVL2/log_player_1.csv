Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified. 
* **Time Pressure:** By implying you have other interested buyers (""before I list it publicly""), you create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your absolute minimum is $12,000."
