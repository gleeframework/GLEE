"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I really love the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1300000, which would be $1350000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1350000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1300000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
