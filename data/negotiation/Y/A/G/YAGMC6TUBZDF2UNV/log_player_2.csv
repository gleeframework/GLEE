"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly lower. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking to spend $7500, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target, it's still above my desired price point. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8250 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go down to $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $8150. This is as low as I can go, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's final offer is $8,150, which is close to my target of $8,000. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's also much better than buying from John for $15,000."
