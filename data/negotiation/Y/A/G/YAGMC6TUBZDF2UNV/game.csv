"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking to spend $7500, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8250 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to go up to $8000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go down to $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $8150. This is as low as I can go, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",8150.0,Alice,5,
