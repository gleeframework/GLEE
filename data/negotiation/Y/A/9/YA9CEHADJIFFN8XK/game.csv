"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. It's a rare find, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway once, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
