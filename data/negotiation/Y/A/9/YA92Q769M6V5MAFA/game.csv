"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $160 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $140 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",130.0,Bob,6,
