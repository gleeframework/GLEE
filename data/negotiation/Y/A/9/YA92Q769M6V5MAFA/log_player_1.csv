Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150) to give myself some room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $160 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer of $140 is still below my desired value. I'll counteroffer again and try to push for a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $140 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $130 is still below my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk losing more time in negotiations. It's time to move on and sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
