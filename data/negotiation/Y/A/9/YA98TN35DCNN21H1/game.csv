"I'm interested in the product, but I think $850000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $825000. I'm willing to pay $775000 for it, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $1000000.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to John. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
