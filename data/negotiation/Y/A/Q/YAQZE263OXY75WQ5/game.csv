"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us, $900,000 is a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, $1,200,000 is still out of reach. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
