"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. It's still a great deal considering its value and rarity, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9000. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I really appreciate your understanding, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need you to meet me at $11250. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
