"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" to justify the high initial price without revealing specific details.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and collaborative, expressing confidence in a mutually beneficial deal. This encourages Bob to counteroffer rather than walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's start our negotiations from this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is expected. We're still far from our minimum acceptable price. Selling to John right now would meet our minimum, but we have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from the true value and potential this product offers. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's unique capabilities and the substantial return on investment it can provide."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant price reduction ($200,000) to show Bob we are willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Holding Ground:** We are still considerably above both Bob's offer and our minimum price. This signals the product's high value and our determination to secure a favorable deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's potential and ROI, subtly shifting the focus from a fixed price to the value Bob would be gaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the product's potential, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm confident we can both benefit from a deal at $1,500,000. This would represent a good return for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay. While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, it's risky. Bob is clearly aware of the product's value and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting now secures a good deal without the risk of losing both Bob and John."
