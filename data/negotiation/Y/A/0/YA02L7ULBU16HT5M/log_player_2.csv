"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high, exceeding Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's crucial to start the negotiation by rejecting the offer and moving to a counteroffer to establish a more realistic price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's start our negotiations from this point."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from the true value and potential this product offers. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's unique capabilities and the substantial return on investment it can provide. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer has come down from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's best to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I recognize the product's potential, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm confident we can both benefit from a deal at $1,500,000. This would represent a good return for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
