"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly less than its market value. While I'm confident I can get $1,500,000 from another buyer, I'm willing to let you have it for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
