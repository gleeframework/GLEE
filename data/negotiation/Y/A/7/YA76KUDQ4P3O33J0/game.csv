"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly less than its market value. While I'm confident I can get $1,500,000 from another buyer, I'm willing to let you have it for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Please let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
