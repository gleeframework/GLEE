"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. To ensure we both benefit, I propose a price of $110 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring you get a good deal while also maximizing my earnings. Please let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",105.0,Bob,2,
