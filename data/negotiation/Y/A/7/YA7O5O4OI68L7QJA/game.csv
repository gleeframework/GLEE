"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $100 right now.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $120 is close, but I need to get at least $140 for it to be worth it for me. That's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $140 is still out of my budget.  I can go up to $130, but that's really my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Bob,6,
