Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so starting at $9,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted rate might lead to a faster sale than waiting for John. 
* **Polite and Professional:**  The tone is friendly and positions the offer as mutually beneficial."
