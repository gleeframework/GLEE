"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still do better by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  This allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's more advantageous to buy it from John and avoid further negotiation."
