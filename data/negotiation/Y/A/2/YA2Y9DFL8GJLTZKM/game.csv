"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
