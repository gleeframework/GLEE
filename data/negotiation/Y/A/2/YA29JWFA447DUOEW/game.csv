"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still committed to finding the best deal possible. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I've considered your offer carefully, and while I appreciate your efforts to find a solution,  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but I can't go lower than $11,000. This is my best price, and I truly believe it's a fair one considering the value of the product.  If you're truly interested, this is our last chance to reach an agreement. Let me know your decision.",11000.0,Alice,5,
