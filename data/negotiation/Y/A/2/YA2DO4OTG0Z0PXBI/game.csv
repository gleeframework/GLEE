"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $12,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum price point. I'm confident this price still allows for a fair profit for you and provides a great value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",8000.0,Bob,2,
