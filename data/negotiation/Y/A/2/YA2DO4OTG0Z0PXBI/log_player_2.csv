"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Considering its value and your potential benefit, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This offer is tailored to provide you with a great deal while ensuring a fair return for us. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $12,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum price point. I'm confident this price still allows for a fair profit for you and provides a great value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This offer aims to strike a balance between what we consider a fair profit and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks further delays and potentially a higher price in the future.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
