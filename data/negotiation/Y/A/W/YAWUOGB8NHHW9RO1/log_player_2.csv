"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't quite go down to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's new offer of $11,250 is closer to Bob's desired price but still above his budget of $12,000. 
* There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get Alice to come down further."
