Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, knowing that I'm willing to go lower if necessary. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my minimum of $8,000.
* **Being open to negotiation:**  Saying ""I'm open to negotiation"" signals that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John gives me confidence to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is the lowest I'm willing to accept.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll get it. By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a guaranteed sale at my minimum price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me confidence that I'm not settling for an unfair price."
