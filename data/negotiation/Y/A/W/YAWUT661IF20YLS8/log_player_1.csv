Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but thinks the price is too high. It also reflects that the product is worth at least $100 to me, so I'm not giving it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than $100, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $135. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my desired price, and further negotiation might not yield much more. It's a good price considering John would only offer $100.  I'll accept the offer and sell the product to Bob."
