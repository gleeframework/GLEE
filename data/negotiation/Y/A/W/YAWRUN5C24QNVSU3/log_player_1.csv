Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I want to make sure it's worth the price. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm aiming for a higher price than $11,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to my initial offer of $13,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $12000, which would be $11500. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer for $11,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
