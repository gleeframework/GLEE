"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I want to make sure it's worth the price. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to my initial offer of $13000.  How about we meet in the middle at $12000?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $12000, which would be $11500. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
