"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1300000?  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1325000. This price is fair to both of us and reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
