{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option with John, there's no harm in seeing if you can get Alice to go lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows I'm serious about negotiating.  It's a good starting point to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $8,500 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to reject and see if I can get her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my target."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I've already shown I'm willing to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $8,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go much higher.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise point."
