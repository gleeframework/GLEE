"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This price is fair considering the product's potential and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,650,000?  This still allows you a great deal and reflects the value this product brings.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget. How about $1,450,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
