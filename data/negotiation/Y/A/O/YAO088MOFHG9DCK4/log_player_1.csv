"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still within reason. This allows for negotiation and gives me a bit of leverage. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $750,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $850,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it gives us both room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price point while still showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to reiterate its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick closer to my initial proposal. How about $825,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price point.  I'm going to accept it to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with less."
