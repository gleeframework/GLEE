"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is my final counteroffer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
