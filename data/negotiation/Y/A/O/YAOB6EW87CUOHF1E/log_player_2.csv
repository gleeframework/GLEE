"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less.  He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step down from her initial offer, $16,000 is still above his budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's budget.  He has already made his final offer, and it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  It's better to go with John and get the product at a price he's comfortable with."
