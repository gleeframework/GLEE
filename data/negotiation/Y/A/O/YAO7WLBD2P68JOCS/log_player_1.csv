""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $925,000 is a fair reflection of that. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** Knowing John will buy for $800,000 provides a safety net. Offering significantly lower to Bob risks leaving money on the table.

This offer aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, giving Alice a strong chance of securing a price significantly above her minimum."
