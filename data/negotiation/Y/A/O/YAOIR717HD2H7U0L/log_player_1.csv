Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Scarcity & Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's ""immense value"" and expressing confidence in its ability to ""exceed expectations"" reinforces its worth in Bob's mind, justifying the high price."
