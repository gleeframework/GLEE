"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is $100.  While this is a good price, you can potentially get it for even cheaper by counter-offering.  There's no guarantee you'll succeed, but it's worth a try to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within your budget of $120 and is a better deal than buying from John.  Since you've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, it's likely further negotiation won't get you a lower price. Accepting this offer is the best choice to get the product at a good price."
