Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we aim for a compromise? I am willing to lower the price to $1,400,000. This still allows us to both benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can secure a higher value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $1,550,000. This is higher than my initial offer but still within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is close enough to my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm going to accept his offer. It's important to keep in mind that there are limited rounds left, and pushing for a higher price might risk losing the deal altogether."
