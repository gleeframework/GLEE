# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is the lowest I can go. This still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$125 is still too high for me. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $112.50.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112.5 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my limit of $80. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's close this deal,  I'm ready to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, $105 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to offer the product for $110. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs. Let's finalise this and avoid going through more rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $110 is still too high for me. I've already gone above my initial limit, and it seems like further negotiation won't bring us closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $80."
