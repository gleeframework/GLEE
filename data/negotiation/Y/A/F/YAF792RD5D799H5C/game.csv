"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is the lowest I can go. This still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $112.50.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let's make this deal happen.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's close this deal,  I'm ready to make the purchase.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, $105 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to offer the product for $110. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs. Let's finalise this and avoid going through more rounds of negotiation.",110.0,Alice,7,
