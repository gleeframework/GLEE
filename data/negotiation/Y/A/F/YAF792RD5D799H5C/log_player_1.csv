"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I will reject Bob's offer of $85. It is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is the lowest I can go. This still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

I will reject Bob's offer of $100. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $112.50.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 112.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's close this deal,  I'm ready to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, $105 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.
