"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I'm aware that this is above Bob's initial value, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also aware of the 10 round limit and the option to sell to John, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price, and I'm not yet convinced that Bob is willing to pay my minimum. With only 6 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer and counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm dropping my offer further, but still aiming for a price above my minimum value. The clock is ticking, and I need to find a way to close this deal without losing out to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not securing a deal with Bob is becoming too high.  It's better to guarantee the $1,500,000 from John than to risk getting stuck at a lower price with Bob."
