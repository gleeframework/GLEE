"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely try to get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested in the product, $180 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice moved closer to our range but $160 is still more than John's offer. We'll continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, I have a pretty firm budget for this, and $130 is the most I can do."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

We are moving closer to Alice's price, but we are still aiming to stay below John's offer. This counter offer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $145, which is a reasonable compromise and saves us $5 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
