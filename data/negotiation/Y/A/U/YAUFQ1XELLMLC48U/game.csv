"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1350000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1400000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and meet at $1425000?",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $1375000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we meet at $1400000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1325000?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
