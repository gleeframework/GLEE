Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), I want to maximize my potential profit. Starting higher gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the higher price by emphasizing the product's value and my belief that it's worth at least $100. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  By using phrases like ""willing to offer"" and ""what do you say?"", I signal that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating the price. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
