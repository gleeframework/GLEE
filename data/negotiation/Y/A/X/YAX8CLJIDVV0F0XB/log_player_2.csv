# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to make one more move. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

This seems like a good deal now. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting the product for $725,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000."
