"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice is willing to lower her price. If she doesn't, you can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $300,000 drop from her initial price is substantial.  If she's truly motivated to sell, she might be willing to meet me halfway.  If not, I can always move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to try to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. There's still a chance Alice will come down further, and even if she doesn't, I can always purchase from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my limit. This is a compromise that might be appealing to Alice, especially if she's genuinely interested in selling. If she rejects again, I'll be prepared to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still above my maximum budget. I am going to try and negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. There's still a chance Alice will come down further, and even if she doesn't, I can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to go as high as possible, but won't exceed my limit. If she rejects, I'll happily buy from John. This move creates a strong sense of urgency for Alice, as she risks losing the sale entirely."
