"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're open to negotiations.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12250.0,Bob,4,
