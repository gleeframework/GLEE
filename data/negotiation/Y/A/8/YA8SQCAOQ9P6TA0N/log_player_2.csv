"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely and explains that while the initial price is too high, I am still interested. Offering $100 is still a significant markup from Alice's value of $80.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  The goal is to find a price that works for both of us.  Alice gets a profit, and I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $130 is a fair starting point considering its value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $115? This offer balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $115 is still too high.  It's clear she's willing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $107? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 107
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between my last offer ($100) and her counteroffer ($115). This common negotiation tactic can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By round 4, it's good to show some movement towards a deal. This price is getting closer to my limit, but it still provides some buffer. 
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes the idea of finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
