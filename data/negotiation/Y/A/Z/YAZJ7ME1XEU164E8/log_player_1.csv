"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for negotiation. This strategy also helps gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number ($1,500,000), we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to our desired range. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for counteroffers and allows us to gradually move towards a mutually agreeable price without going below our minimum acceptable amount ($1,200,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is appealing but $1,500,000 is too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We have a guaranteed offer from John at our desired price, so there's no reason to settle for less. We'll reject Bob's offer and present a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to negotiate closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession by coming down $100,000 to show Bob we're flexible and open to negotiation.
* **Staying Firm:** However, we're still significantly above both his offer and our minimum price. This keeps the pressure on him to move closer to our range.
* **Justification:** We're re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially encourage Bob to reconsider his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount and a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we started higher, we've successfully negotiated him up to our desired amount. There's no incentive to continue negotiating or risk losing the deal. We accept Bob's offer."
