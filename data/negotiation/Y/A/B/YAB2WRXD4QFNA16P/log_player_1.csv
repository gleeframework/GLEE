"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high opening offer, but it's necessary to start the negotiation with some room to maneuver. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming high. If he's truly interested, he may be willing to pay a significant amount. If not, I have the option to counter-offer or walk away and sell to John."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and still below my minimum value.  It's worth exploring further with a counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm not getting too far away from my ideal selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not high enough. I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can close the gap further.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, but with only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000.  It's a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better deal than what Bob is offering. We're getting closer to finding a middle ground, and I'm optimistic that we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value. While I would prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, with only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep pushing for a higher price. There's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer of $1,000,000. It's more prudent to accept this offer and secure a profit."
