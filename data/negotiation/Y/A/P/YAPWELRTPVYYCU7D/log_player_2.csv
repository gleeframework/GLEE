Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I could come down to $95. That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer.

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price you find acceptable.  You can get the product for $80 from John, which is a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
