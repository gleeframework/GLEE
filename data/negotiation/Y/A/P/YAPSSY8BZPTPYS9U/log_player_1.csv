Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  You're aware that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving you significant bargaining power.
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation ($12,000) increases the chance of a quick sale at a high profit margin. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While you've started high, there's potential for Bob to negotiate down slightly, and you'll still be well above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **The John factor:**  You have a safety net in John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
