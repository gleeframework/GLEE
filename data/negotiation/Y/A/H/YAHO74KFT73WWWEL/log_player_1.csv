"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price that's close to that, but still gives me a good profit.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I won't go too low too quickly."
