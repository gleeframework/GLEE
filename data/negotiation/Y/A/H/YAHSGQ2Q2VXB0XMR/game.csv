"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to look at the product and providing your perspective. While $75000 is far below what this product is worth, I am willing to be flexible.  To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to drop the price to $500000.  Let's continue this discussion and see if we can find a middle ground.",500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I believe the product's fair value is closer to $250000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, I believe $250000 significantly undervalues its potential.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $400000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",400000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. After further consideration, I believe a fair price for the product would be $300000. I hope this aligns better with our mutual interests.",300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $300000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $350000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",350000.0,Alice,7,
