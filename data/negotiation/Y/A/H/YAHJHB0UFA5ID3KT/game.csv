"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $18000. I think it's a great value, but I'm open to negotiations. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $14500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we try $14500 again? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the value this product offers.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I think we've been close for a while now. I'm willing to make one final offer: $14000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",14000.0,Bob,8,
