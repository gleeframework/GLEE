"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are trying to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $95 is above your maximum value of $100.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm confident you'll still get a great value for the product at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still above your ideal price, but it's closer to your maximum value of $100.
* Accepting this offer means you'll save $10 compared to buying from John.
* While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'll be left with only the option of buying from John at a higher price."
