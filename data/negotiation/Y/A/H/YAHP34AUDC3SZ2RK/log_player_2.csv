Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to lower it to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too much for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm offering the product for $1,085,000. It's a very small difference from your last offer, and I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price, and Alice is only $5,000 away from your last offer.  It's likely that you won't get a better deal with Alice, and John is significantly more expensive. Accept the offer."
