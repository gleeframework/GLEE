Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This allows you to potentially make a profit and leaves room for counteroffers.
* **It's a strong opening:** This shows you are confident in the value of your product and are serious about selling it to Bob.

However, remember that this is just the beginning of the negotiation. Be prepared to counter Bob's offers and be willing to walk away if he doesn't meet your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low. It's below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and significantly less than the value you perceive the product to have. Accepting this offer would result in a huge financial loss. 

Instead, you should reject his offer and proceed to the next round. This allows you to counter with a more reasonable price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is closer to your desired price:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **You acknowledge Bob's offer:**  ""I appreciate your interest but..."" shows that you're listening and engaging in the negotiation.
* **You offer a compromise:**  ""How about we meet in the middle..."" indicates your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. 
* **You emphasize the value of the product:** ""The value of this product is much higher..."" reminds Bob of the potential benefits he'll receive.

This counteroffer shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product, but you also value it and won't settle for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $725,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss. 

You should reject his offer and proceed to the next round. This will give you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your desired amount. It's important to remember that you have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000, which gives you leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've stated, and it gives us both some room to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is still above your minimum:** $875,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **You acknowledge Bob's budget constraint:** ""I understand you're working within a budget..."" shows that you're aware of his limitations and are willing to compromise.
* **You offer a compromise:** ""Let's try $875,000. This is a fair price..."" indicates your willingness to negotiate while still holding your ground.
* **You highlight the value for Bob:** ""considering the value you've stated..."" reminds Bob of the potential benefits he'll receive, even at this price.

This counteroffer shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product, but you also value it and won't settle for a price too far below your minimum. It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate but are also prepared to walk away if needed."
