"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've stated, and it gives us both some room to be happy with the outcome.",875000.0,Alice,5,
