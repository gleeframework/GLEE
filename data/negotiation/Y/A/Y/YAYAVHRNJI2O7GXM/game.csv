"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $900,000 price point doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $950,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
