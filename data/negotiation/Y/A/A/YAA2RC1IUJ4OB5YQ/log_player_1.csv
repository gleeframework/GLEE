"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and potentially set a high baseline for negotiations. 

It's important to remember that I have a floor price of $1,500,000 with John, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. This allows me to be strategic and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's initial proposal. I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiations, while still reflecting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't undervalue the product. I'm going to reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If he continues to offer such low prices, I might consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,600,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still confident in the value of the product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer shows my willingness to compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still far too low.  I'm running out of time, but I'm unwilling to accept a price so far below my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  If this doesn't work, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,400,000.  I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal value.  I believe this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, while still holding firm on the worth of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and ensures I don't lose out on any potential gains."
