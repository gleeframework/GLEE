"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $10,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",10500.0,Alice,5,
