"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my alternative purchase option. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to get the product for a significantly lower price than Alice's starting point.  A starting counteroffer of $9,000 gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my alternative option.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a polite and interested tone is important for a successful negotiation.  I want Alice to know I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my price range, but she's still offering a price higher than what I can get from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I'm ready to walk away and go with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $10,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By countering with $9,500, I'm essentially asking Alice to split the difference between her last offer ($10,200) and my previous offer ($9,000). This shows willingness to negotiate but holds firm on getting a good deal.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** I'm getting close to my limit.  If Alice doesn't budge significantly, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $10,500.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, it's not worth the risk. I can buy the product from John for $10,000 right now, saving me $500. It's time to walk away and take advantage of the guaranteed good deal."
