"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great asset for you. My asking price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise and gives me a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Would you be open to this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. I'm hopeful we can close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to work with him and hopefully motivates him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $9,750 for the product. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 one last time. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm using a bit of pressure by mentioning ""other options"" which subtly hints at selling to John. This could encourage Bob to reconsider. I'm sticking to my price of $10,000 hoping it will be enough to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  His final offer is still below my desired minimum, and with only two rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can secure a better deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is a much better outcome than risking a lower price with Bob."
