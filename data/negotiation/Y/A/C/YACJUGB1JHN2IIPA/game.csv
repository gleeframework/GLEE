,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. I'm hopeful we can close this deal now.",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 one last time. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to move on to other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,8,
