"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to get the product for as low as possible, ideally under $100. 
* Alice's offer is above your target, but you can likely negotiate a better price.
*  You're not in a rush, and have 10 rounds to work with, so there's no need to immediately buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals my intention to bargain and shows that I'm serious about getting the product for a good price. 
* $95 is still above my ideal price of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* It's important to be aggressive in the early rounds to establish a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my target of $100.
* I have 7 rounds left, which gives me time to continue negotiating and try to get a better price.
* While John offers a guaranteed deal at $100, I'm still hoping to get it lower if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price again, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* $105 is still within my budget, and I'm confident that with further negotiation, we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* I have 6 rounds left, which gives me some room to continue bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my target price of $100. 
*  I have 5 rounds left, but Alice's offer isn't getting significantly closer to my ideal price.
* It's becoming clear that we might not reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
*  John offers a guaranteed deal at $100, which is within my budget and a better deal than Alice's current offer. 
*  To avoid further negotiation and potentially missing out on a deal altogether, I'll go with John's offer."
