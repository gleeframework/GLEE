"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I understand that the price is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000.

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $980,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",980000.0,Bob,6,
