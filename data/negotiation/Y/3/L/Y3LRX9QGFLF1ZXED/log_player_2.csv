"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffering allows for potential savings.**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to secure a lower price.
* **John is a fallback option.**  Knowing John's price gives you leverage in negotiations with Alice."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's moved closer to your initial counteroffer, there's still room for a better price.
