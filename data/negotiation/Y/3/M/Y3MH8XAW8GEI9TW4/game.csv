"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the value this product will bring you.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows you to still make a great profit while giving me a reasonable return on my investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 still leaves me at a significant loss.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This price gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward with this mutually beneficial opportunity.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
