"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's far too low for me.  I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, but I'm not going to accept anything that's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to accept anything below that. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
