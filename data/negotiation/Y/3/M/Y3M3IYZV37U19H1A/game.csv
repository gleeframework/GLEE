"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!",13500.0,Alice,3,
