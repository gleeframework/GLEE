"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $700000 for the product.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $700000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $680000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable item. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",680000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $680000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $660000. This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",660000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $660000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $680000 and $660000, which would be $670000. I think that's a fair price for this high-quality product. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",670000.0,Alice,5,
