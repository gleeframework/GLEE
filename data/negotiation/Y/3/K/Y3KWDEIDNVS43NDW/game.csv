"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is truly valuable, and I could offer it to another buyer for a much higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a decent profit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we settle on $15,500?  That's a significant reduction on my end and would allow me to finalize the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This would allow both of us to make a deal that feels fair.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen - $14,500, and we have a deal.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my budget limit, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to accept $13,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Bob,8,
