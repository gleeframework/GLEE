"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we settle on $15,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This would allow both of us to make a deal that feels fair.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $13,500 guarantees a sale now and is still a decent profit over my minimum. Holding out for more with Bob risks losing him and having to settle for John's $15,000."
