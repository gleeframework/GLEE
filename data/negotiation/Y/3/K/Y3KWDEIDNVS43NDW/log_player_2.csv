"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's in your best interest to reject and counteroffer to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is truly valuable, and I could offer it to another buyer for a much higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject her offer and counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground closer to my $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we settle on $15,500?  That's a significant reduction on my end and would allow me to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000, even with the reduction. While tempting, I want to push for a lower price. I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to secure a better deal before running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This would allow both of us to make a deal that feels fair."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen - $14,500, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is clearly getting closer to my preferred price point, $14,500 is still above my limit. I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further before resorting to buying from John. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to my budget limit, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to accept $13,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
