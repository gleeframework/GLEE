"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer,  $12,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
