"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $950,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
