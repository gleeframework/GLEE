,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider that price point?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm still feeling a bit stretched.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This price is fair to both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle from here.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! $1,150,000 is a good number, but I'm still looking to save a little more.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're in a game of tug-of-war! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to budge much further. I'm going to make a final offer that I hope will meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,120,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll see the value in making a deal at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
