,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in its value exceeding $2,000,000, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to move the deal forward. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering our previous discussions.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach a deal.  Would you consider $2,025,000?  This is a significant move on my side.",2025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my budget, Alice. However, $2,025,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and your willingness to compromise.",1850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're close but need to find that final point of agreement. My other offer is getting increasingly tempting, but I'm confident this product holds more value for you. How about we settle at $1,950,000?  This is my final offer.",1950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,850,000. I've already stretched my budget to consider this product, and I need to stay within my limits. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1850000.0,Bob,8,
