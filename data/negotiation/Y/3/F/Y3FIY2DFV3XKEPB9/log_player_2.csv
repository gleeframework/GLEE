```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. It's a great price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say?

Alice has come down significantly, but $13,000 is still over my budget. With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time and negotiating power.  It's more beneficial for me to buy from John at $10,000, as I'm guaranteed the product within my budget."
