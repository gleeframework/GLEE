{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a reasonable point, leaving room for potential concessions while still maximizing my profit.  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's price.  This will show my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my interests."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,200,000?  It's still a fantastic price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $1,200,000, which is exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good price while also emphasizing the value he's getting.  
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price for me. If Bob accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'm prepared to go back and forth a few more times or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,150,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob at a price slightly higher than his latest offer. I'll emphasize that this is my final offer, and if he doesn't accept, I'll be moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've really enjoyed our negotiation, but I need to be realistic.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,175,000 as a final offer. This is the best I can do.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,175,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm  being clear that this is my final offer and that I'm prepared to move on if it's not accepted. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy is designed to put pressure on Bob to make a decision. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that high. I've already considered buying the product from John for $1,000,000, and I'm starting to think that might be the better option for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000, or I'll have to explore other options?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to go any higher than $1,150,000. While this is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John, who is willing to pay my desired price.  

**Why this is the best decision:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,500,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizes Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might not come up to my desired price, resulting in a lower profit or a missed opportunity with John.
* **Time Efficiency:** Selling to John allows me to close the deal quickly and move on to other opportunities.

**Final Thoughts:**

While I was willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm committed to getting the best possible price for my product. Selling to John allows me to do just that."
