"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,200,000?  It's still a fantastic price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to make this deal work.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,150,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've really enjoyed our negotiation, but I need to be realistic.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,175,000 as a final offer. This is the best I can do.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that high. I've already considered buying the product from John for $1,000,000, and I'm starting to think that might be the better option for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000, or I'll have to explore other options?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
