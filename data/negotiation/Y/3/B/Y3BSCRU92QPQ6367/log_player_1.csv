Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and the mention of ""fair price"" might nudge Bob to reconsider. 
* **Limited Risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you still have the safety net of selling to John at your desired price.

This strategy balances the desire for higher profit with the understanding that a lower price increases the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
