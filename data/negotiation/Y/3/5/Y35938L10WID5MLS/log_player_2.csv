"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still providing you with a solid return."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still within my budget.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my next offer and I might end up paying John's price. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a good price and avoid any further negotiation."
