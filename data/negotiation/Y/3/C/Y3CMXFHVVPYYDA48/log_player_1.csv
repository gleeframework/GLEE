Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.

Offering the product at $140 creates a potential win-win:

* **Bob:** Gets the product for $20 less than his perceived value.
* **Alice:** Makes a $10 profit compared to selling to John. 

While a higher price is tempting, it significantly increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
