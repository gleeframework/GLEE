**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Buying from Alice saves you $2,500 ($12,000 - $9,500).
* **Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, that's not relevant to your decision.** Your goal is to get the best deal for yourself, not to ensure Alice makes a profit."
