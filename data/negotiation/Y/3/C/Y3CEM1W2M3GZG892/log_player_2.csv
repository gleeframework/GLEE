"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price closer to his ideal. $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $11,500 could work for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still some room to negotiate. Bob can try to get a price even lower than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but is showing a willingness to meet halfway with Alice's latest offer.  $11,000 is a reasonable compromise that still saves Bob a significant amount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to think about the value this product brings to you. How about we try $11,250? I'm confident you'll see the value in that price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is only $250 higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $11,000.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will only yield minimal savings.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a significantly lower price than John's while leaving some room for profit for Alice."
