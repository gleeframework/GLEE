Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This is a starting price that is above my minimum value of $80. It gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:** 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I hope to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good deal. If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter or even sell to John for $80 if I feel the negotiation is not going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John for the same price."
