Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer gives you a profit of $15, which is better than the $0 you'd get if Bob rejects the offer and you sell to John.  While there's a chance Bob will reject this offer, it's a good balance between maximizing your profit and keeping the offer appealing."
