Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm open to negotiation and will consider his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle for less than $80 right now. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my minimum.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get $80, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'll accept his offer."
