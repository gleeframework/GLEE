While Alice's offer of $105 is better than her previous offer, it's still above my budget. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."

Alice is offering $100, which is still $20 above my maximum budget of $80. I've already rejected her last offer and countered, and I don't want to risk her rejecting my offer again. It's better to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring I get the best deal and avoid further negotiations."
