Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from her. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures the product at a significant savings compared to John's offer."
