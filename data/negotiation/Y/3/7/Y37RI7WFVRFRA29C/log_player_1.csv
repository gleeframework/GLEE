Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, aiming to establish a common ground for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating my willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

This approach sets the stage for a productive negotiation while ensuring I'm not giving away too much value upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I believe the product holds. There's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Seeking a Better Outcome:** I want to maximize my profit.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a less favorable outcome.
* **Building on My Value Proposition:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can reiterate the value of the product and push for a price closer to my initial offer.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, this product is truly unique and its value to you is significantly higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Compromise:** I'm presenting a middle ground, indicating willingness to negotiate while still securing a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Maintaining Position:**  I'm not drastically lowering my price but showing flexibility.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually acceptable price while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or even a breakdown in negotiations.
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of selling to John for a significantly lower price.

This decision balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to secure a sale and minimize the risk of a worse outcome."
