"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still above your desired price point of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down to $115, but that's as low as I can go.  It's a great price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as it's still better than buying from John. I'll try to push Alice a little further with a counteroffer."
