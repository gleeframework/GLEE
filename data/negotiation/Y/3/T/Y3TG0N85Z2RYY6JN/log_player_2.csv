"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

This offer is quite high. There's significant room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Alice's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000."", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point to understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's closer to her value, which puts us in a better position to eventually reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll keep pushing towards a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

We're incrementally increasing our offer to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below $800,000. This keeps the pressure on Alice while leaving us with options if she declines."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This offer is close enough to Alice's value, and significantly below John's price. Accepting now secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
