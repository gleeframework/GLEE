"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $18,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly.  Buying from John right now would be a loss, as the product is only worth $10,000 to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to create room for negotiation.  
* **Expressing Value:** I acknowledged the product's value to me, showing I'm serious but have budget constraints.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""Would you consider..."" the counteroffer comes across as less aggressive and more collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. Could you do $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $15,000 is a significant reduction, but it's still above my maximum value for the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice explicitly stated her willingness to negotiate, indicating further price drops are possible.
* **Alternative Option:** I still have the fallback option of buying from John for $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be open to $10,000?  That's my limit, but it would let me get this valuable product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now offering my maximum price. This signals to Alice that I'm serious and not willing to go any higher.
* **Justification:** I'm clearly stating my budget limit and emphasizing that this price allows me to acquire the product.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains respectful and appreciative of Alice's willingness to negotiate."
