"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you, and a solid profit for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good price for Alice, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is worth a try:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, giving you a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a good compromise, allowing you to get a great product at a fair price while ensuring I get a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $1,100,000 is still above your budget and leaves less room for negotiation in future rounds.
* **More room for negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counter-offer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Time is on your side:** You still have 7 rounds left, which is enough to continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This is a fair price that offers you a solid profit while staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen, I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. $1,087,500 is a fair compromise, giving you a great deal and ensuring I get a respectable profit. This is our last chance to make a deal before I consider selling to John. Let's be smart and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's getting closer to your target, $1,087,500 is still above your ideal price point and leaves less room for future negotiation.
* **Time is still on your side:**  You have five rounds left, and with some negotiation, you may be able to secure a lower price.
* **Risk assessment:** Buying from John would cost more, but you still have a buffer of $112,500 to work with in negotiations. 

**The strategy here is to keep the pressure on Alice, reminding her that you have a backup option. You're aiming for a price closer to your $1,050,000 target, and there's still time to negotiate.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,087,500 is still slightly outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,062,500 for the product. This is a fair price that leaves us both with a reasonable margin. It's a deal that works for us both, or we can both walk away and explore other options.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,062,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This is a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to secure a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  $1,075,000 is only $25,000 higher than your last counter-offer, and it's within your budget.
* **Time is running out:** You only have three rounds left, and the risk of buying from John for a higher price is increasing.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting this offer, you could still try to negotiate a slightly lower price for the final payment.

**At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product within your budget. You've managed to get a good deal, and with three rounds remaining, you could potentially negotiate a further price reduction during the final payment process.**"
