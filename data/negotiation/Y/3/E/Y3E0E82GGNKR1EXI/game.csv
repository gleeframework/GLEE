"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a significant discount. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still too high for me. While I recognize the value of this product, my budget is capped at $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which still offers you a substantial saving.  Let's meet halfway.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a good compromise and a fair price considering my budget. I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $900,000 is still quite far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we keep working together.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $950,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer you $925,000. This is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm offering $940,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",940000.0,Alice,7,
