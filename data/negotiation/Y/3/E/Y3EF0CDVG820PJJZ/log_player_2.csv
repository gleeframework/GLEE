"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth $150 to Bob, Alice's offer of $120 is still above the product's worth to her ($80). This indicates there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice's offer of $110 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the likelihood of getting a significantly lower price is decreasing. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** If Bob rejects this offer, he runs the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer, forcing him to either pay John $150 or risk losing the product altogether. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $110 is the most sensible option, securing the product at a price lower than John's and still leaving a good margin for Bob."
