{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially agree. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust your price based on Bob's reaction. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
