Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Maximize Profit:**  A higher price means potentially more profit for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I leave room for negotiation if Bob is interested but thinks the price is too steep. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to ask for a higher price from Bob.

**The potential outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! I make a profit of $300,000.
* **Bob rejects:**  No problem, I can sell to John and still get my minimum acceptable price."
