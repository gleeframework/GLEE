Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  
* **The Gap:** There's a $300,000 difference between your minimum and Bob's valuation. Your goal is to bridge this gap as advantageously as possible.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. This allows you to be more assertive in your pricing. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer above Bob's valuation but below your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
2. **Provide Justification:** Offer a brief, plausible reason for your asking price. 
3. **Be Confident:** You have a backup plan, so project confidence in your offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique features and market value, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is above Bob's valuation but below your guaranteed price, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely mentions ""unique features"" and ""market value"" to justify the price without revealing specifics.
* **Confidence:** The tone is confident and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,400,000) to allow more negotiation room.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to close the deal quickly, a slightly lower offer might be more enticing.

**Remember:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your price based on Bob's response."
