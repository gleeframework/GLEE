{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). It leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident that Bob will find it appealing.
* **The message:** It's friendly, positive, and emphasizes the value of the product. It doesn't pressure Bob, but encourages a response.

This initial offer sets the stage for a successful negotiation. I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm also ready to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, hopefully closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This price is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my desire for a profitable transaction.
* **The message:**  The message is polite and reaffirms my interest in selling to Bob. It acknowledges his budget concerns but emphasizes the fair value of the product. This encourages further negotiation while leaving room to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise that much on the value of my product.  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get a fair price and don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
