"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $140?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $155? I think it's a fair price for a product that you'll love.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $150?  That's my absolute top price, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",150.0,Bob,4,
