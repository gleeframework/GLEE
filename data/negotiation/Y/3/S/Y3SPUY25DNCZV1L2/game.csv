"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives me a good price and hopefully is within your range.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which I think is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $115, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
