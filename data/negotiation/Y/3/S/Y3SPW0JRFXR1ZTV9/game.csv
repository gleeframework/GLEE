"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $920,000, which is closer to my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $920,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try $890,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, and it's much closer to a price we can both agree on.",890000.0,Bob,6,
