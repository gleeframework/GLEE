"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $900,000 is better than the previous offer, it's still above his target. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $850,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $920,000, which is closer to my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $920,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob is likely to continue negotiating for a lower price, hoping to reach a compromise closer to his counteroffer of $875,000."
