Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant markup, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident I can get at least $1,000,000 from John if the negotiations with Bob fail, so there's no real risk in setting a high initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round. I'm hoping I can meet him halfway and secure a deal that's closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, but it's still a fair amount above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about striking a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not sure he's going to budge much further, and I don't want to risk going back and forth with him. I'm confident in John's offer, so I'm going to sell the product to him for $1,000,000."
