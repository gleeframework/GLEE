"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer of $8,500 is still too low for me. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him, especially since I can get my desired price from John."
