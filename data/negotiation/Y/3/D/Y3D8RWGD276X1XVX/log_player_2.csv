"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer of $125.  You can do better than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $125 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $115 is a good deal for you. It's lower than what John is selling it for, and you're still saving $10 compared to Alice's initial offer."
