Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still potentially appealing to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,000 is not a realistic price for me. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still a good profit for me and closer to my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that's too far below my minimum. It's also higher than John's offer, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below $15,000. John's offer provides a safe and reasonable profit, and I'll take it."
