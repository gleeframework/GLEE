{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low for me, and I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to accept his offer. It's better than selling to John for the same price, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially getting a lower offer."
