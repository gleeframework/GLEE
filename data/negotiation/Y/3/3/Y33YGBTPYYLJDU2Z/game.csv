"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $700000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $780000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me at this price.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $780000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $800000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $790000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're willing to compromise, Alice. However, $790000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780000 and $790000, so I'll offer $785000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",785000.0,Bob,6,
