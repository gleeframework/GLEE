"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. My initial offer is $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the product's value to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $700,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $780000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $780,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, but I'm very close. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $780,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $800,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $790,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to compromise, Alice. However, $790000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780000 and $790000, so I'll offer $785000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob,  $785,000 is too far below my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing more rounds and potentially getting an even lower offer.  It's better to secure the $800,000 from John and move on."
