"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be open to a price of $11,000?  This would allow us both to get a fair value from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
