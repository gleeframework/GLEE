"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within $10,000. Could we perhaps aim for $11,000 as a compromise?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  This product is worth a significant investment.  Would you consider $12,500? That's a very small compromise from my original offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
