"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $6,800?  That feels like a fair compromise.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,800 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I think $7,200 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to bump my offer up to $7,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be thrilled with the product's performance.",7100.0,Alice,7,
