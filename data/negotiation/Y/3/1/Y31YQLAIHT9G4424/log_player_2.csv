# Alice's message: I understand that $1500000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I have to say that I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000.

{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but $1,700,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
