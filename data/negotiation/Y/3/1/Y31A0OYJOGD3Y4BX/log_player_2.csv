"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its value to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is happy to pay my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than what John is offering. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
