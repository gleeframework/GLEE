"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I was thinking of starting with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking with your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is still a great deal for you, but also a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price again is high. Accepting the offer at this point ensures Bob gets the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer, while still leaving some room for profit."
