"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking with your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is still a great deal for you, but also a fair price for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
