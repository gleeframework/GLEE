{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $150, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price and my initial offer. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this deal right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit far off. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my minimum price. While I'd prefer more, it's a good compromise. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
