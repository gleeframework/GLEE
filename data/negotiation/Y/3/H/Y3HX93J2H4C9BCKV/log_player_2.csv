"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the product's unique benefits and potential for your business.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly, but her ""final offer"" is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
