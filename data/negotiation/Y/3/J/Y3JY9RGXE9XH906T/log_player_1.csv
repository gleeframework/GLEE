Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so he'll likely consider this offer. 
* **It's lower than your floor price:** You're willing to accept a minimum of $12,000, so this price gives you some wiggle room.
* **It allows for potential negotiation:** If Bob balks at $11,000, you can always try to negotiate a price closer to your desired amount.

Remember, you want to make the most money possible, but also keep in mind that a deal is better than no deal!"
