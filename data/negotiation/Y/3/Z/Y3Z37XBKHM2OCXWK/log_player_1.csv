Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and allows you to significantly benefit as well."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without losing him to the backup offer from John ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Alice's minimum.
* **Win-Win Proposition:** The message emphasizes that this deal is beneficial to both parties. Bob gets the product he values, and Alice receives a price significantly higher than her minimum."
