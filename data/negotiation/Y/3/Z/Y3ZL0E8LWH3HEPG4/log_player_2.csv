"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation. 
* **It's early in the game.** You have 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into a deal. 
* **You want to see how low Alice is willing to go.**  By rejecting the initial offer, you can gauge her willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $900,000 is still a good profit for Alice, leaving room for compromise.
* **Setting a clear target:** By stating your willingness to pay $900,000, you establish a starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $950000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  While she has moved closer to your target, $950,000 is still more than you're willing to pay right now.
* **More room for negotiation:** You've already demonstrated your willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown she's flexible.  There's still potential to get a better deal.
* **You're in a good position:** You have 7 rounds left, so you don't need to rush into a decision. By continuing to negotiate, you might be able to secure a price closer to your ideal $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still not quite there on the price, but I'm willing to go to $925,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but steady progress:** By increasing your offer by $25,000, you show Alice you're serious about negotiating and willing to meet her halfway.
* **Staying within your budget:** $925,000 is still within your price range and allows you to save a significant amount compared to Alice's previous offer.
* **Reiterating your commitment:** Emphasizing that this is a ""fair compromise"" and a ""good deal for both of us"" subtly pressures Alice to accept, showcasing the mutual benefit of the agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $937500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I think it's time to finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $937,500 is very close to your desired price of $900,000. 
* **Midpoint compromise:**  Alice has essentially met you in the middle, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Limited time:** With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer will save you a significant amount compared to buying from John. 

While it's tempting to try and push for a lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
