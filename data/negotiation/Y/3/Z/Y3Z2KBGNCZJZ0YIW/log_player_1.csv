"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong initial offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Future Rounds:**  This initial offer gives me a sense of Bob's willingness to negotiate and helps gauge his upper limit.  I'm prepared to adjust in subsequent rounds based on his response. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and sell to John at any time for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase, it's still substantially lower than my initial ask and well above his perceived value. This indicates room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to his upper limit while still remaining above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While this product represents a significant investment, I recognize its value to you. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've reduced my price by $200,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value proposition, subtly anchoring it to the higher price.
* **Targeting the Zone:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price range.
* **Time Pressure:**  As the negotiation progresses, I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the need to reach a mutually acceptable agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet.  He increased his offer by only $100,000, suggesting there's still room for negotiation.  I need to hold firm and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand the value of this product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. I can't go lower than $1,900,000 and still feel good about this deal. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding firm at $1,900,000, signaling this is a serious offer close to my limit. The tone is less flexible but emphasizes understanding and fairness.
* **Shifting Focus:** Instead of large concessions, I'm making smaller adjustments now. 
* **Emotional Appeal:** I've added a touch of personal feeling (""feel good about this deal"") to create a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to close the gap.
* **Direct Question:** Ending with ""What do you say?"" prompts Bob for a direct response and hopefully a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is now at $1,600,000, only $100,000 above my absolute minimum with John.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely increases.  
* **Time Value:**  Securing the deal now avoids further time and effort spent on negotiation, allowing me to move on to other opportunities. 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
