"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for a unique opportunity like this.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. The value of this product is undeniable, and I'm sure you recognize its worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a good profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's still a bit high.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
