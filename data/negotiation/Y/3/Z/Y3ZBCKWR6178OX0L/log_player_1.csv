{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for a unique opportunity like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I still have a lot of negotiation rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. The value of this product is undeniable, and I'm sure you recognize its worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's still a bit high. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,025,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to my target.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is willing to pay $1,000,000."
