Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to end up with a price closer to your desired range.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer at $80. This knowledge empowers you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $80, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.  
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate the price down."
