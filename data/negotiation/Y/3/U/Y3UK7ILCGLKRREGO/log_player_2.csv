"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to get a better price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** You can always walk away and buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go in your favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $900,000 is a reasonable starting point considering my budget and Alice's potential profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my budget.** While she has moved closer to my price, it's still $50,000 over what I'm willing to pay.
* **John's offer is a better deal.** I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, making Alice's offer less appealing.
* **There's potential for further negotiation.** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to offer $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If this isn't acceptable, I'm prepared to purchase from John, but I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my absolute maximum, and I'm stating it clearly to put pressure on Alice.
* **Highlighting John's Offer:**  Reminding Alice of the alternative deal keeps her motivated to accept.
* **Compromise and Confidence:** Offering $1,000,000 shows a willingness to compromise, but also expresses confidence in my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Even though she's come down a bit, it's still above my budget.
* **John's offer is a better deal.**  I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving me $75,000 compared to Alice's offer.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks reaching a stalemate or getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers.

It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
