"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stick to my budget.  My final offer is $10,000.  I think that's very fair.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
