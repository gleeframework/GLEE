Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $87.50? I think this is as low as I can go and still make it worth my while.

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is within your budget of $150 and a good deal compared to John's price. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
