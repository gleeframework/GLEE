"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $87.50? I think this is as low as I can go and still make it worth my while.",87.5,Alice,5,
