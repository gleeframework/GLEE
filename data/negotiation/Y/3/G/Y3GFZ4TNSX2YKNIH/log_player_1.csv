Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for him to counter-offer and still get a good deal. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By starting high, you demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell and that the product is valuable.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to Bob's value ($15,000) as possible without giving up too much profit. Keep your eye on John's offer of $12,000 as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, but it's closer to your minimum than you'd like. You can try to push for a slightly higher price. Since you're confident about the product's value to Bob and he's already shown interest, you have some leverage to negotiate further.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round.  Consider offering something close to $13,500. This allows for some compromise while still keeping your profit margin healthy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
