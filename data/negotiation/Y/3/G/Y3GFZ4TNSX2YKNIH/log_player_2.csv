"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value:** You're willing to pay $15,000 at most, and Alice is asking for $14,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  It's likely Alice would be willing to sell for a lower price than $14,000, since her minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering the product for $13,500.
* **The price is fair:** While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,500. You are saving $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject the offer, Alice might reject your counteroffer, and you might end up paying the full $15,000 to John."
