"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Alice,  $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,9000.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? Let's split the difference.",8750.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,9000.0
"I see you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about $9,375? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for a great product like this.",9375.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,875.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that amount.",8875.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000. It's close, but I'm willing to pay $8,900. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this amount. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Bob,8,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm going to make one final offer: $9,000, and that's my last word on the price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,9,,
