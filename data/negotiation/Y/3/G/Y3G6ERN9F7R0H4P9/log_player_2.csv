Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

While Alice is showing some flexibility, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $16,000. At this point, accepting John's offer of $15,000 ensures you get the product at the best possible price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has the potential for further savings, but also risks her sticking to her price and forcing you to accept a worse deal."
