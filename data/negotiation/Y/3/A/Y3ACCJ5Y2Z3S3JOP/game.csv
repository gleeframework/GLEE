"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $9,500 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,100. I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",10100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,100. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,100, which would be $9,800.5. I think this is a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,6,
