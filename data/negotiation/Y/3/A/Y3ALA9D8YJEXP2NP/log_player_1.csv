Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is only worth $100 to Bob.  
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob refuses.
* **The Offer:** By offering the product at $140, we give Bob a significant discount (almost 30% off) while still making a profit of $40. This is a tempting offer that Bob is more likely to accept than a price closer to $150. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
