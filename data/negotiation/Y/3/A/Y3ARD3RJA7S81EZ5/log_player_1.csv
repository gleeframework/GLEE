{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) but still within a reasonable range. This allows room for negotiation and leaves potential for a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob. 

I'll be ready to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and the potential of a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is above my minimum of $12,000, I believe I can still get a better price. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still being reasonable.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to pay $15000, which is my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and while I'd prefer to get a bit more, $15,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John for $12,000, and it's likely that Bob will not budge further.  Accepting his offer ensures a successful sale and a decent profit."
