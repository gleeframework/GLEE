"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price of $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be open to considering $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I can offer the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer on this price point.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further to reach an agreement. Would you consider $9,100 for the product? This is the highest I can go.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer the product to you for $9,300. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",9300.0,Alice,7,
