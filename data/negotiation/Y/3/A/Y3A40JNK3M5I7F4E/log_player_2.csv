``` 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're nearing the end of negotiations:** With only a few rounds left, the potential for significant movement on price is low.
* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **The price is reasonable:** $9,300 is a significant saving compared to John's $12,000 price.

Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away entirely and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
