Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product's worth to Alice is her ""reservation price"" â€“ the minimum she'll accept. 
* **Bob's Value:** This represents the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **John's Offer:**  Acts as Alice's safety net, guaranteeing she can sell for $1,500,000.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation. This maximizes her profit while still ensuring Bob accepts the deal, as it's a better outcome for him than rejecting and getting nothing.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it brings."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Why This Works**

* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is significantly lower than Bob's valuation, making it a compelling deal.
* **Profitable for Alice:** Alice secures a price well above her minimum.
* **Time-Sensitive:** The message implies the offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation. If she had more information, she might adjust her price slightly higher."
