Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
