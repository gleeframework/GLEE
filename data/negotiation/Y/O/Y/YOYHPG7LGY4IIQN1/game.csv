"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price, but $1,200,000 is still quite a gap from what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
