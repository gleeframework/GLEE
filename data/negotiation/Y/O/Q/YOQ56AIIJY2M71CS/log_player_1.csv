Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build some rapport with Bob by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but $85 is not even close to my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $95 is still too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this happen.  However, $95 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for you.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $100. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to drop my price to $105.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
