"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this happen.  However, $95 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for you.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $110 is better than $120, it's still a little too high for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $100. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to drop my price to $105.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

While $105 is a better price than before, it's still above my limit of $80. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems Alice is not willing to go lower. I'll go with John and buy the product for $80."
