"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it would be a great addition to your collection. We are offering this remarkable item to you for $10,000. We hope this price aligns well with your expectations and allows us to facilitate this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $10,000. This means there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of your product,  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I am proposing a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on it while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $9,000.** This is still below your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.**  You could potentially get a lower price, but you also risk Alice walking away or getting stuck with the higher price from John.
* **Accepting the offer is the most practical choice.** You get the product for a price you're comfortable with, and you save money compared to buying from John."
