"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) and higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to make it seem like a worthwhile investment for Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds, keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  I can still attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and it gives us both some room to agree. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a positive negotiating environment. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm still open to further negotiation, showing flexibility while staying close to my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to signal my willingness to compromise while ensuring I still receive a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a reasonable compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000, it's still slightly below. 
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, meaning there's no room for further negotiation if I reject.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm weighing the potential of getting slightly more by counteroffering against the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob one more time, aiming for a price just above $950,000. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $950,000 is a tempting offer. However, considering the value of the product, I can only accept a price of $975,000. This is a very small difference, and it allows us to close the deal without compromising too much. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $975,000 is only $25,000 higher than Bob's final offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing a desire to close the deal, making it seem like a final, reasonable offer.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000.  I've already pushed the negotiation as far as I can, and it's better to secure a guaranteed price than risk losing the deal entirely."
