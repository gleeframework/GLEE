"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This represents a significant saving for you and ensures a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
