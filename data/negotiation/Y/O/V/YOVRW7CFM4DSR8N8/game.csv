"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,500.  This is a significant concession on my part, but it shows my commitment to reaching a deal with you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to $8,750, but that's still not quite where I need to be. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair deal, but $9,250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8,500, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,8,
