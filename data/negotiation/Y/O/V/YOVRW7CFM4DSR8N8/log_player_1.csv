"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving space for potential compromise and a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle yet, especially since I can sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,500.  This is a significant concession on my part, but it shows my commitment to reaching a deal with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident I can do better and I'm not willing to settle yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're committed to $8,750, but that's still not quite where I need to be. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair deal, but $9,250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8,500, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting very close to my minimum, but I only have a couple of rounds left. It's not worth risking losing a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000.  I'm going to sell to John to secure the best possible outcome."
