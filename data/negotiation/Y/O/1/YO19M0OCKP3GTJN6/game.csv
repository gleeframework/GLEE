"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a significant opportunity for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
