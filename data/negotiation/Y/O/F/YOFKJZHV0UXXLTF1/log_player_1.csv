"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,750,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 rounds left, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1,250,000. This would give you a good deal, and it would be closer to the value you've mentioned."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is an improvement, I'm still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still far too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,100,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be realistic here. $1,100,000 is still too much for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I still need to reach at least $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. I have 4 rounds left, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob.  I need to be careful though, as I don't want to miss out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."

Round 7
