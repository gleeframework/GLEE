"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $14500? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, his offers are still below my minimum price of $15,000. I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired value and avoids any further negotiations."
