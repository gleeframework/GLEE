"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $14000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $14500? I think that's a fair price for the product.",14500.0,Bob,4,
