This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to 1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for 1075000. This price is still a good compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
