"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount to you.  While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I can tell you it holds a potential value of $1,200,000 for someone with your expertise. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, giving you a substantial profit. This is a one-time offer, so please consider it carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who will gladly take it off my hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **The product's value to Alice is irrelevant:**  Bob's decision should be based on the price he's willing to pay, not on what the product is worth to the seller. 
* **Potential profit is secondary:**  While Alice mentions a ""substantial profit"", Bob's primary goal is to save money, not maximize profit."
