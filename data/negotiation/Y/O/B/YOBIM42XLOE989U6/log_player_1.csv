{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  My starting price is $1,400,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire this product at a price that's still beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount in this early stage. I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a different valuation of the product, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000 at this point.  This price still offers you a substantial gain, and it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for a loss at this point, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to offer $1,230,000, which is closer to my initial target. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds. I've made multiple concessions, but it seems we're at an impasse.  To ensure I don't lose out on the higher price, I'll sell the product to John."
