"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  My starting price is $1,400,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire this product at a price that's still beneficial for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a different valuation of the product, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000 at this point.  This price still offers you a substantial gain, and it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to offer $1,230,000, which is closer to my initial target. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
