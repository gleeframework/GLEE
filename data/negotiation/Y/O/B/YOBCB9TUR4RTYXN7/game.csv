"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider a price of $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $7,500.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $6,750. I'm offering the product to you for $7,125. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",7125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I respect that.  To be honest, my absolute top budget is $7,000.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your top budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",7250.0,Alice,7,
