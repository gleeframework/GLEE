"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and proceed to the next round.  $1,400,000 is still too high, and there's a good chance Bob can get a better price by negotiating with Alice or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John at this point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, but I need to be at or above this price to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,280,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000, which is a good compromise considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1260000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,260,000 is not quite enough. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000, but I need to be at or above this price to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  At this point, the negotiation with Alice has stalled, and Alice's offers are still too high.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option, as it allows Bob to achieve his goal of acquiring the product while saving money."
