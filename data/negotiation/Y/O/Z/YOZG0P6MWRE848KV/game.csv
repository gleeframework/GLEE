Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. This product does sound very interesting. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $850000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $800000.  This is a fair offer considering your last counter and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $825000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
