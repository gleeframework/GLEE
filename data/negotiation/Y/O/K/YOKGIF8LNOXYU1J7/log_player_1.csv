Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer is above your minimum threshold of $15,000, giving you a decent profit. It's also not too high that it would be immediately rejected by Bob, giving him some room to negotiate if he's interested.  Since you don't know Bob's value for the product, this approach balances maximizing your profit with a chance of closing a deal."
