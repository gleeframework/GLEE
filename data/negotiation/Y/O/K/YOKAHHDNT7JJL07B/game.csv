"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit out of your budget, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go over $10,000. That's my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I've already met you halfway with the previous offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
