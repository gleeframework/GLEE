"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob is trying to save money, and Alice's offer is too high. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit out of your budget, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go over $10,000. That's my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I've already met you halfway with the previous offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit and Alice has stated this is her final offer. Since $11,500 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, he should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving himself $1,500."
