"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,200.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,200, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
