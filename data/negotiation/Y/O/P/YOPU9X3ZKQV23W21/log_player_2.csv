"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  Also, Bob knows he has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, which gives him leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe you'll find it a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is within Bob's budget and still a decent price for the product. Although Bob could potentially continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, there is no guarantee that Alice will continue to drop her price.  Given the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
