Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what I'd get from John, but still leaves a considerable margin for Bob. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This means he has a $400,000 ""cushion"" to work with.
* **My value:** I value the product at $800,000.  This means I need to secure at least this much to avoid a loss.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $1,000,000, I'm leaving Bob with a $200,000 profit, which should be appealing. At the same time, I'm securing a $200,000 profit for myself, which is a good result.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the possibility of a deal with Bob alive."
