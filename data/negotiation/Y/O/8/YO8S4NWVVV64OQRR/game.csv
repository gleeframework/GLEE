"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, and I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I can tell you're firm on the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and close at $1,000,000 even?  This way we both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
