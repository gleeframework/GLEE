"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $85 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $82 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $85. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $87.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $86? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",86.0,Bob,6,
