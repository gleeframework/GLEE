Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $150."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I can't go as low as $90, I'm willing to come down to $105. This would be a great deal for you and gives me a price I'm happy with. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still a bit far from my desired price and think I can get closer to it. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum price. How about we settle at $100? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we meet at $97.50? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5

I've had enough of negotiating with Bob. It seems like he's not willing to budge much further, and I'm getting frustrated. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than getting stuck with a price I'm unhappy with."
