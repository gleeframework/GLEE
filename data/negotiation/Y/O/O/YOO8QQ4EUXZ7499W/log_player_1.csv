Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** This price gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  
* **John as a safety net:** Having John's offer of $1,000,000 in the back of my mind gives me the confidence to hold firm if Bob doesn't come close to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  I can counteroffer and try to close the gap.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always turn to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to try and find common ground.  This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant benefit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving from $900,000 to $850,000.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain value:**  $850,000 is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to his offer, increasing the likelihood of agreement. 
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the value the product offers and how a deal would benefit both parties.
* **Keep John in mind:** While $850,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and gives me some breathing room before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $825,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a significant profit, and further negotiation might not be worth the time.
* **Risk of losing Bob:** If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob entirely. He might walk away, and I'll have to start over with another buyer.
* **John as a fallback:**  I still have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a significantly lower offer.

While I'd prefer more, securing a sale at $825,000 is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
