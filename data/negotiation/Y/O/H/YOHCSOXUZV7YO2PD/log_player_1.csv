""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the middle ground between Bob's valuation and your minimum allows you to maximize your potential profit. By offering it at $1,300,000, you leave room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above your baseline. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Bob's response might give you insight into his willingness to negotiate further.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if needed, but always keep your $800,000 minimum in mind."
