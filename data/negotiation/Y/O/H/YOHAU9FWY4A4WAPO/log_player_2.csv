You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still aiming to save more money.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate keeps the option open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $108 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more.  How about we meet at $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to cover my costs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is firm on $110. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk is that the deal could fall through and you'd have to buy from John for $120. Accepting Alice's offer at $110 is the best option to secure the product and save some money."
