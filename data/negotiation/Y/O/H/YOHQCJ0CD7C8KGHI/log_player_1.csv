{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** $14,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000. This allows for potential counter-offers and leaves me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:** It sets a clear expectation and signals that I'm serious about selling but also willing to find a compromise.

The message is friendly and encourages a response. It also highlights the value proposition for both parties.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response, always keeping in mind my minimum price and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to accept such a low price and risk losing a substantial amount of money. I will reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:** It shows willingness to negotiate but doesn't significantly lower my asking price. 
* **It's fair:** $12,000 is a fair midpoint between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **It's still profitable:** $12,000 is above my minimum price, ensuring I won't lose money on the sale. 
* **It's encouraging:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob and keeps the negotiation open."
