"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, given its value to me and allows for some profit for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000, and it's still a good profit for me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price given its value to me and allows for you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $15,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000, and it's getting close to my minimum target.
