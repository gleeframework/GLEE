"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high ($1,800,000) anchors the negotiation in your favor. It leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting the product's value and your openness to discussion creates a collaborative atmosphere despite the ambitious opening price.
* **Strategic Consideration:**  While you have John as a backup, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the priority in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than your initial ask.  You have room to negotiate and it's early in the process. Accepting now would leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the value of this product really is significant. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but with Justification:**  You are moving down from your initial offer, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, but not drastically.  The phrasing emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** You're aiming for a price point closer to the middle of the initial offers. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still pursuing a strong profit.
* **Continued Negotiation:** It's still early in the negotiation, and you haven't reached a point where walking away is the best option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $1,400,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,550,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob is moving very slowly in his offers. This suggests he might be willing to go higher, especially since he set a firm upper limit.
* **Time Still Available:**  You still have several rounds left to negotiate. While accepting Bob's offer would be profitable, you can likely secure a better deal. 
* **John as Leverage:** The option to sell to John gives you a strong alternative if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to get this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making a more substantial concession this round ($75,000) to signal flexibility and a genuine desire to close the deal. 
* **Midpoint Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims for a point slightly above the middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's last offer.  
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message emphasizes the significance of your concession and reiterates the value proposition to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,537,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,537,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has now met you above the midpoint of your last offers. This is a favorable outcome.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to push for more, the potential gains are getting smaller, and you risk antagonizing Bob.
* **Time Factor:**  You're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures a very good price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away later."
