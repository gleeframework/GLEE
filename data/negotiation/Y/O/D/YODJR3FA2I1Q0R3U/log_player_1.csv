Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $13,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value increases my potential earnings.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $13,500 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, ensuring I don't have to go below $15,000. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
