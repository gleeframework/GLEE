{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at the maximum price I believe Bob will accept. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and then decide if I want to negotiate further or simply sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'll try to negotiate with him further and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120. This still leaves me a decent margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's a good middle ground for us both, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  How about $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
