"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the value of the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in buying it, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about we meet at $180? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still a little high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is firm at $80. If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to consider buying from John instead.",80.0,Bob,4,
