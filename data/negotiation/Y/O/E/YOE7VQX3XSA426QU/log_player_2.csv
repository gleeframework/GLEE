{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice's first offer is significantly lower than your maximum.  You can try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $3,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $4,000 is better than $5,000, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
``` 

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $3,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and avoiding further rounds of negotiation. There's a good chance she might not budge much further and I risk losing the deal altogether."
