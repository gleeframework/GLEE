Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob only values the product at $8,000, we want to start with a price closer to our minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** By presenting it as a ""great deal,"" we aim to pique Bob's interest and potentially encourage a quick decision.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we have the security of selling to John for our minimum price."
