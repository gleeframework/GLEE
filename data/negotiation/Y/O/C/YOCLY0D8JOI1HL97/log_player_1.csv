{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which can make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see how Bob responds. If he rejects the offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer of my own.  I'll also keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's tempting to accept $80, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, but I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $100. I'll also try to understand his reasons for rejecting my previous offer to make my counteroffer more persuasive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a good deal for both of us. 
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I use language that suggests I'm still open to negotiating, but I'm firm on $90 as my current offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see how Bob responds to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below what I believe the product is worth to me.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $90 and $85.  I'll also try to understand his reasoning for rejecting my previous offers to make my counteroffer more persuasive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference on this one. How about $87.50?  That's fair to both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between my last offer of $90 and his offer of $85. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I emphasize the fairness of the price and how it benefits both parties. 
* **Positive framing:**  I use language that suggests I'm still motivated to reach a deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be ready to either accept or reject Bob's next offer, depending on how close it is to $87.50. I'm keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $82.50 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not worth it to me to keep negotiating. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed deal:**  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I'm guaranteed to get a better deal with him than I can with Bob at this point. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation has gone back and forth several times, and I'm not convinced Bob will budge much further.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reach out to John and accept his offer of $120, ending the negotiation with Bob."
