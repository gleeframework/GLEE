"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1400000. How about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
