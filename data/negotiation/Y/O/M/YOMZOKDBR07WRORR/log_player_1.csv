Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you and it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation without me having to immediately go down to my minimum price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will:

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Great!  I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll need to decide if his counteroffer is worth pursuing or if I should move on to selling the product to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I am only willing to pay $8,000 for it. This aligns better with my budget. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a secure backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I'll explain why my initial price was justified and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  My initial offer of $10,000 was already a significant discount from the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be able to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving down to $9,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm reminding Bob that my initial price was already a significant discount, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he accepts, I've made a successful sale. 
* If he rejects, I'll have to decide if I should continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. Let me know if there's any way we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unwavering stance:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $8,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time is money:** Continued negotiation with Bob could drag on and potentially result in a lower price or a deal falling through altogether.
* **Secure alternative:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll politely decline Bob's offer and inform him that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer. While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement, I've secured a favorable sale that meets my financial goals."
