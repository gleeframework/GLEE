"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget of $120, and it's a better price than what John is offering.  While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
