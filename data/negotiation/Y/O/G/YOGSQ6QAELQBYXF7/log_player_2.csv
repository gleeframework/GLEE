"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so offering $8,500 is a fair starting point for a counteroffer.  This leaves some room for negotiation while still offering Alice a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to Alice's minimum price point while still saving money.  Offering $8,800 is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway but still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal for Bob. While it's not the absolute lowest price he could potentially get, it's significantly better than the $10,000 John is asking.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, as Bob is already getting a good deal.  Accepting the offer saves Bob time and effort in further negotiations."
