Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum selling price of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $120 to him, so he might be willing to pay a little more than $100. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** You're not starting too low, indicating you're confident in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we come down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  You're better off rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** This counteroffer is your minimum acceptable price, so you're not losing money.
* **Compromise:** You're showing flexibility by coming down from your initial offer, but not going too low.
* **Emphasis on Value:** You're reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping he'll see the value in paying a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice. How about we settle in the middle at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $82 is just above your minimum acceptable price of $80.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or you might end up selling to John for less. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
