"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is cheaper than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice clearly values the product at a higher price than you do, so there's a good chance she might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming low to maximize potential savings. This offer leaves significant room for negotiation upward, towards my $10,000 limit. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  I want to keep the negotiation amicable. Expressing interest while suggesting a lower price shows I'm serious but budget-conscious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too far below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice met my price! This is the best possible outcome - I get the product at my maximum budget without needing to involve John."
