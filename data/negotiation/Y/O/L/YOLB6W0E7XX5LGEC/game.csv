"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $925,000.  While I value your interest, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm prepared to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $935,000. This is a fair compromise that ensures both of us get a good deal. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
