"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept on the first offer.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $20 discount is a good starting point, and if she rejects, we can continue to refine our offer based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  Accepting at $110 saves me $10 compared to John's offer and represents a good compromise.  There's always a chance I could get lower, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it at this point."
