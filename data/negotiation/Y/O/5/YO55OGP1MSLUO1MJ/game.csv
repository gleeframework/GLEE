"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to pay that price.  I'm interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $950000. This seems like a fair value given the product's worth to me and your desired selling price.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my desired selling price.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
