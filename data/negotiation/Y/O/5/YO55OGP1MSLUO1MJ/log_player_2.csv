"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your desired price point.
* There's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* Buying from John would be a worse deal financially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to pay that price.  I'm interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $950,000. This seems like a fair value given the product's worth to me and your desired selling price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my desired selling price.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement over her initial offer.
* This price is much better than buying from John for $1,500,000.
* While there's always the potential to get a slightly lower price, accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
