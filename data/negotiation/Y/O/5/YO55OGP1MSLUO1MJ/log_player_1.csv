Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to pay that price.  I'm interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $950000. This seems like a fair value given the product's worth to me and your desired selling price.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
