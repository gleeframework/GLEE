# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my [product name] at a special price of $850000. This product is worth at least $800000 to you, so this is a great deal.  Let me know your thoughts. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

You should reject Alice's offer.  Even though she claims it's a great deal, you can get the same product from John for a lower price of $800,000.  It's always better to save money when possible."
