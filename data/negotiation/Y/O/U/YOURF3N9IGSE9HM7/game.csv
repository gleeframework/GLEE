"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. I'm willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and adheres to my budget constraints. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",11000.0,Bob,4,
