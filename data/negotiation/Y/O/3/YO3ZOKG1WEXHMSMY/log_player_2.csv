Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,400. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,350. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,350.

Alice's offer of $7,350 is the best price she's offered so far.  It's still a good deal for you and saves you $650 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round, so it's a good idea to accept this offer."
