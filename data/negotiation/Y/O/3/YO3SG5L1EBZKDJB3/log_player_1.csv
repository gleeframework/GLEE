{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, a price significantly higher is unlikely to be accepted. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,400,000 positions the offer as a potential bargain compared to your guaranteed sale price, even if it's above Bob's perceived value. This creates a psychological advantage.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price still above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. If your main goal was simply to secure a sale quickly, offering a price closer to Bob's valuation would be more effective."
