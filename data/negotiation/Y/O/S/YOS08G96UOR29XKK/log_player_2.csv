"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a price closer to $10,000."
