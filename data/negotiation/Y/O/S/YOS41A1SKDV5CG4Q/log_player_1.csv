I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.  This is a strong starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm aiming for a higher price than John's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but I'm not desperate to sell. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to keep the negotiation going and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is slightly higher than John's offer and is getting closer to my ideal price. It's a good compromise, so I'll accept it."
