"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product. ",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 is still too low.  How about $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
