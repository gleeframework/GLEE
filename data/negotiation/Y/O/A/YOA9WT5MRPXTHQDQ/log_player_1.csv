"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, justifying the high price without revealing specific details about my bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While starting high, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer, I secure a fantastic deal.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will indicate how aggressively I can negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm better off rejecting this offer and countering in the next round. I have ample room to negotiate before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe to be its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to strike a fair deal while acknowledging the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've significantly reduced my price from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):**  However, I'm not getting too close to my $1,000,000 minimum yet. I want to see how Bob responds to this substantial concession.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes ""true worth"" and ""inherent value"" to remind Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the still-higher-than-his-valuation price. 

By making a substantial move, I aim to:

1. **Encourage Reciprocity:**  Bob might be more inclined to make a significant counteroffer in return.
2. **Maintain Negotiation Space:**  I still have room to go lower if needed in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or that negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer secures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
