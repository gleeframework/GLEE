"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's see if we can close this deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78?",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $78 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $81? It's a fair price for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  $79 is very close to my minimum. I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $81. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to consider other options.",81.0,Alice,7,
