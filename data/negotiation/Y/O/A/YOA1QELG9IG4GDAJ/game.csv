"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's something I value at no less than $10,000, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know if you're interested! If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $10,000, so this is your chance to secure it for a slightly higher price.",11000.0,Alice,1,
