"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is very interesting, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1200000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your seriousness in this negotiation. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both be happy with. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit too high, though. Let's split the difference again.  How about $1400000? I'm feeling confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1600000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'll meet you at $1520000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hesitant to go that high, but I'm willing to come up a little more.  How about $1450000? This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
