Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but still offers me a profit.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd rather sell to Bob than John, I'm not willing to take a $10 loss. I will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 less than John's offer.  It's worth accepting this offer as I'm still making a profit and avoiding the risk of a lengthy negotiation."
