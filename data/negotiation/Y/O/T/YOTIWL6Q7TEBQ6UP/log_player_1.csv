"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal, as it's above my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk he might lower his offer or walk away in future rounds.
