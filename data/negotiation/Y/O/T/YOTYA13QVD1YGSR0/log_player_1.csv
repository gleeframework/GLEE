Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $900,000 is more than the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:**  It's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000, so I'm not giving the product away. 
* **It leaves room for bargaining:** We have room to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. 

By starting with a higher price, I give myself the opportunity to potentially earn more than $900,000, while also ensuring that I can still walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I want for this product. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but no more. Can you meet me in the middle and consider $862,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $862,500 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum and allows me to move forward with the sale.  I also have a guaranteed option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation falls through, making this a good risk/reward scenario."
