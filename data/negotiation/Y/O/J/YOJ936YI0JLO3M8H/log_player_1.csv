Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob seems to have hit his upper limit, and with only two rounds remaining, the risk of him walking away increases.  Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 is a solid gain over John's standing offer and a reasonable compromise."
