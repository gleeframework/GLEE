"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, it's still lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $1,250,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about $1,225,000? It's a compromise, and we can close this deal and both be happy.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a very fair deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
