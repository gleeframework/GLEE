"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, it's still lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $1,250,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but hopefully still above my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about $1,225,000? It's a compromise, and we can close this deal and both be happy."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a very fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise. It's still a decent profit for me, and it seems like a fair price for Bob.  I don't want to risk going another round and potentially having to sell to John for a much lower price."
