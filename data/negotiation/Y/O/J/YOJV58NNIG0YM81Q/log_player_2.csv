Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer you $10,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Alice's offer is still above your budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's better to buy from John and avoid further negotiation. You'll save $2,000 by going with John's offer."
