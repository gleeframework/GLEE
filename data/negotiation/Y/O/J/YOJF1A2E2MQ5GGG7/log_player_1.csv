Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting high, at $170, hoping to maximize my profit.  While Bob only values the product at $120, I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer if needed. I'm also keeping John's offer of $150 in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter-offer.  While I'm happy with John's $150 offer, I'd prefer to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counter-offering at $155. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price and below John's offer. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $145 is within my minimum threshold and closer to John's offer. It's not ideal, but it's a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John."
