"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer slightly above your target price. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception of value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 allows for negotiation down to at least $1,100,000, which is still a significant profit margin. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The message aims to be polite yet firm, gauging Bob's initial interest and willingness to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000).  It's worth negotiating further to try and secure a better deal.  We have ample room to negotiate before reaching John's offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant returns. To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but in a calculated manner.
* **Holding Ground:** The counteroffer of $1,100,000 still maintains a healthy profit margin for us.
* **Maintaining Value Proposition:**  The message continues to emphasize the value and potential return on investment the product offers, justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $1,075,000 to move closer to my budgetary constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  We are still in a strong position, and holding out for a slightly higher price is strategically sound. We have plenty of rounds left and can afford to push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,090,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer represents a near-perfect split of the difference between Bob's last offer and our previous asking price. This strategy often signals a willingness to compromise and can encourage a deal.
* **Urgency and Fairness:**  By phrasing it as ""finding a solution that works for both of us,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency while maintaining a collaborative tone. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  While close to our desired outcome, this offer still leaves a small margin for potential further negotiation if Bob pushes back."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,085,000. This brings us closer to my budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We have successfully negotiated a price significantly higher than our fallback option (John's offer of $1,000,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate for a smaller amount (e.g., $1,090,000) risks jeopardizing the deal, especially since Bob has labeled his offer as ""final.""
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a few thousand more, the risk outweighs the reward at this point. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,085,000 secures a substantial profit."
