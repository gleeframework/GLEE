"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and you can use John's offer as leverage. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if this works for you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good improvement from her initial price, but you are still trying to save as much as possible. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $11000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if this works for you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and you're only $500 away from your ideal price.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go lower, and you could risk losing the product entirely.  Accepting her offer is the most sensible move in this situation."
