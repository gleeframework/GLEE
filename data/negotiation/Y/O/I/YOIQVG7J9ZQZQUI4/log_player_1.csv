Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $1,225,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $225,000, which is a significant gain.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through entirely."
