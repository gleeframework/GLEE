Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage. A strong opening offer makes sense.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I finalize an agreement with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The $1,100,000 price is a strong starting point. It leaves room for some negotiation but keeps you well above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning another buyer (even without specifics) creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  While not stating specifics, highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. 
* **Relationship Matters:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price. However, in a purely transactional scenario, maximizing your profit is key."
