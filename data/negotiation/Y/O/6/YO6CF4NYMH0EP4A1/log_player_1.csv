Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, as it's still a valuable asset for my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Explanation: Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price well below my minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I risk losing a guaranteed sale with John."
