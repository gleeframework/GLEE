"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value greatly, for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $15,000.  It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price with Alice, or you can simply buy from John and save $1,000."
