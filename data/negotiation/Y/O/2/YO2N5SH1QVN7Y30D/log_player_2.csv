"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($9,000 vs. $8,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option with John at $10,000.** This gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,200. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above the product's worth to you ($9,200 vs. $8,000), but it's closer to your ideal price.**  
* **You're already saving $800 compared to buying from John.** This is a significant savings.
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions, but it also risks Alice walking away.**  The price might not drop much further.

While you could try to counteroffer again, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more, and you risk losing the deal. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price you're comfortable with, while still saving money compared to your backup option."
