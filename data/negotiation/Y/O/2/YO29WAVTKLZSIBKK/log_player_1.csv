Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $825,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting the $825,000 offer secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
