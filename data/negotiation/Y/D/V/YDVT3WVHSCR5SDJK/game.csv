"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with, especially since John is willing to sell it to me for $100. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
