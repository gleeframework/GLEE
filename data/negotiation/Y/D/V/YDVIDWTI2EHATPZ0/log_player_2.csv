# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'll meet you at $89.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.5.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might annoy her and risk the deal.  $89.50 is a good price and well within your budget."
