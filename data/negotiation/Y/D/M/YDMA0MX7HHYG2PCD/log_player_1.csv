Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's value leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, selling quickly to Bob at a higher price is preferable."
