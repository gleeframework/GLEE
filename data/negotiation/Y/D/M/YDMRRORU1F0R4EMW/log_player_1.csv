Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and $10,000 to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to negotiate up to my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John."
