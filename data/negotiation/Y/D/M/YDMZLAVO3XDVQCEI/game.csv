"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This reflects the true value and potential I see in its ability to benefit you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $2,000,000 represents the product's true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this offer is fair considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that's beneficial for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
