"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that's beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he is unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the full value and avoids further negotiation."
