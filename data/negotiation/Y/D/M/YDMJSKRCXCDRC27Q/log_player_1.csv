"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my desired price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount and gauge his potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While $8,200 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? This still gives you a good deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,800, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and still allows for some room for negotiation. It's a more reasonable compromise than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $8000 is a fair price. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to get closer to my desired price. Considering there are only 6 rounds left, I'm not sure I can reach a more favorable outcome. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $8,000 to avoid risking a further decline in price."
