"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $13,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the value this product brings. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to justify the effort and risk I took to acquire this product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,250. This is my final concession, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $14,100?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal right now.",14100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Bob, as we're not that far apart on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to close the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $14,200. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",14200.0,Alice,9,
