"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $150. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price was too high.
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While I'm willing to pay up to $80, starting much lower gives me a better chance of getting a price closer to $60-$70. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have the option to buy from John for $80, so I'm not desperate to reach an agreement with Alice. This gives me some leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $100 is better than $150, it's still above my $80 limit. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway from her initial offer. This indicates there's still room to bring the price down further.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I can always fall back on buying from John for $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $75? That's closer to what I had in mind."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious but staying well below her current offer.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** Aiming for $75 puts us near the midpoint between my previous offer and her counteroffer. This can be a strong psychological anchor for negotiation.
* **Staying Below Limit:**  Importantly, $75 keeps me below my $80 maximum, leaving some wiggle room if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you had in mind. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalled:** Alice has only come down $10 from her previous offer of $100. This suggests she may not be willing to go much lower than $90.
* **Over Budget:**  $90 is still above my $80 limit. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is within my budget and saves me money compared to Alice's current offer.

While there's a chance I *could* negotiate Alice down a bit more, it's risky.  It's better to take the sure savings with John than potentially overpay with Alice."
