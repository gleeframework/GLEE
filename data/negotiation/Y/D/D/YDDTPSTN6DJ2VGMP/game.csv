"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $22,000 represents the product's true value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my eagerness to work with you.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is quite significant. I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $15,500?  This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while acknowledging the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000, which is a significant compromise. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to it.",13000.0,Bob,6,
