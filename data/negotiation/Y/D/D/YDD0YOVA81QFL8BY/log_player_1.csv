Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can then gauge his interest and adjust our price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a drastic discount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still remaining above my minimum price. I believe this offer is fair and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not high enough.  While I'm willing to negotiate, selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I meet my minimum goal.  I'll take the guaranteed sale."
