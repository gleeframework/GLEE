"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $150. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and entering a counteroffer phase makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $115, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high.  While you're willing to pay more than your initial counteroffer, $115 is still above your ideal price point. It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $115 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $110. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between $115 and $110, which would be $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112.50 is still above your ideal price, it's now within your budget of $150. You've already rejected Alice's previous offer and negotiated down from her initial offer.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid potentially losing the deal to John."
