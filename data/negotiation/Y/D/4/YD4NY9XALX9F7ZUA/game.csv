"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $17,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
