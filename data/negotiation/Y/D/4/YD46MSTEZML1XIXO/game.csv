"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $700,000?  That's a fair offer, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
