"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my maximum spending limit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This recognizes the product's worth while finding a price point that might work for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This price respects the value you've placed on the product and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this number.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
