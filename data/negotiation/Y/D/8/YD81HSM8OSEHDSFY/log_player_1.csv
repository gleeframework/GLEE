Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product,  $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11000?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'm interested in selling to him,  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,000?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13000 is still a bit out of my range.  Could we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can't get a better price from him.  It's also higher than what John is offering, so I'm happy to accept."
