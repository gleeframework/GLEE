"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product,  $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13000?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget, but closer than her previous offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  There's still room to bargain, and Bob can use the option of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Could we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 12500}
