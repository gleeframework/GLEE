"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product,  $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11000?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13000?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13000 is still a bit out of my range.  Could we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",12500.0,Bob,4,
