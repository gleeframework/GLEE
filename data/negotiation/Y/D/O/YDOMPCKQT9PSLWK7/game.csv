"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,900,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential value to you. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we settle at $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I believe the product is valuable, $1,700,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
