``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that is closer to my minimum value ($15,000) but still potentially attractive to Bob.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes a potential win-win scenario.

* This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the door open for a successful negotiation."

Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we settle on $13,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

Round 4

# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $12,800 is still a bit too low for me.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```
