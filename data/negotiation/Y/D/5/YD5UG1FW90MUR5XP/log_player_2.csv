Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $90 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, which is $95. How about we try that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $95. You've reached a point where the potential savings with Alice are outweighed by the guaranteed deal with John."
