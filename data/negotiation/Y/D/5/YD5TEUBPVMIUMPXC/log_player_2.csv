"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I've priced very competitively at $11,500. I believe it's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
