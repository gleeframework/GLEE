"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  However, $8,750 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $8,900 for the product.  This is a final offer from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500 is a bit too high, so I'll try to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to accept $8,700 for the product?",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. I'm willing to come down to $8,800 for the product. This is really my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8800.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,600 is a more comfortable price for me. Would you be willing to accept that?",8600.0,Bob,8,
