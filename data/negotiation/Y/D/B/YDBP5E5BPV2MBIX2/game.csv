"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to my value of $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?  This would still leave you a healthy profit and allows me to get a good deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll meet you at $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
