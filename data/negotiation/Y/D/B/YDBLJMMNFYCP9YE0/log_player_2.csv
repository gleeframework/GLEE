{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer gives Bob a chance to see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $120 is a bold move, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his offer based on her response."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
