"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my own valuation but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going down to $130, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my valuation and is still better than selling to John. I think it's worth closing the deal at this point."
