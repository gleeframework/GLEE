"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still more than you need to spend. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John."
