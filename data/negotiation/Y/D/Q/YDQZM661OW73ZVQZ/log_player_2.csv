"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is within your budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly aiming for a price above her product's value to her. You can likely get a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still a profit for her if she accepts. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting low, you leave room to negotiate upwards while staying below your $150 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to her value (which you suspect is $120), but there's still a chance to negotiate a better price. You're getting closer to your walk-away point ($150 from John), but it's worth another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice. How about $118?"",
""product_price"": 118
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** You're showing willingness to move from your initial offer, but only incrementally. This signals that you're looking for a fair deal, not trying to lowball her.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  You're still well below your $150 walk-away point, maintaining room for negotiation.
* **Approaching the Likely Value:** You suspect her value is $120, so this offer puts some pressure on her while still offering a small profit margin."
