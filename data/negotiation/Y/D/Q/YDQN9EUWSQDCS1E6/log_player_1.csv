# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the market value of the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
