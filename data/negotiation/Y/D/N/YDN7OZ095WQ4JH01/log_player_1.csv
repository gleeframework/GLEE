Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product, and I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize potential profit. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $7500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I will counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $8500. This is a good deal for both of us, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting too low, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'll avoid further negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John."
