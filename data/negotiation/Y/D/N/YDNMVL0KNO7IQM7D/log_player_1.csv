Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is slightly below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob the perception of getting a deal while still maximizing your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is firm, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially allowing you to earn even more."
