"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,065,000?  I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",1065000.0,Bob,4,
