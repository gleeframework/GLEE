{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, but $7,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,700. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 7700}

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm not confident I can reach a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000 to guarantee a sale and secure a decent profit."
