"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity. I have a product that I believe would greatly benefit you, and I think its value aligns perfectly with your needs. Given its significance, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $10,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you is $12,000. I understand that such a decision requires careful consideration, so please take the time to evaluate this offer. If you're interested, let's discuss further to ensure everything meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000
* **Your Value:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer means you could end up paying John's full price.  It's a safe bet to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a lower cost."
