It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, as $1,200,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 

This counteroffer represents a substantial discount from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it demonstrates your serious interest in buying while aiming for a significant saving.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While I would love to continue negotiating, Alice has come down to a price that's only $100,000 more than my counteroffer. It's a good price considering the alternative is paying John $1,500,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves me $400,000."
