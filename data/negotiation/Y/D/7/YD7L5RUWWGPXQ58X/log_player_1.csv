Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, while still securing a profitable sale for Alice. 
*  Alice is keeping the option open to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it is significantly less than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  She is willing to risk losing Bob as a customer because she believes she can get a better price by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  Alice is lowering her price slightly from $12,000 to $11,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This shows Bob that she is serious about making a deal but still holds firm on her minimum value.
* **Message:** The message reassures Bob of Alice's interest while firmly stating her price point. It also encourages further discussion and negotiation.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining Alice's position of not settling for less than her minimum price.  She still has the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11200 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's minimum goal is $15,000, Bob's offer of $11,200 is close enough to her lower limit that it's worth accepting. Here's why:

* **Value vs. Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate has a risk of Bob walking away completely or driving down the price further. 
* **Time:**  Negotiating further might take more time, and Alice could potentially lose out on other opportunities.
* **Compromise:**  $11,200 is a reasonable compromise that allows Alice to secure a sale and gain some revenue.

By accepting Bob's offer, Alice minimizes her risk and secures a sale without waiting for a potentially better, but uncertain, outcome."
