"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. While I won't reveal the specific details just yet, I can tell you that it's worth at least $10000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a significant discount from what it could potentially be worth to you. Let me know if you're interested in learning more.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
