"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'd need to start with a significantly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further concessions if necessary.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your feedback. While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually agreeable price. How about $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price is closer to my budget and leaves room for some final negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,4,
