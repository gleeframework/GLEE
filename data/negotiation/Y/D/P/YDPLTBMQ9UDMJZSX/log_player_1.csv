Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'd need to start with a significantly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further concessions if necessary. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually agreeable price. How about $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price is closer to my budget and leaves room for some final negotiation.  What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
