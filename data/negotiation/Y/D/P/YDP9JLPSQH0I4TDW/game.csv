"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $11500.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $12500? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
