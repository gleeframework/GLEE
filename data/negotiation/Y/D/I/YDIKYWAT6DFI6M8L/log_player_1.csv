Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  By starting high, you maximize your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is higher than what you'd get from John, it's still lower than your initial offer, and Bob clearly has room to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. It also leaves a small margin for further negotiation, allowing you to potentially secure a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is still lower than what you initially aimed for, it's significantly higher than what John is offering and represents a solid profit.  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a higher price, but it's also possible he will refuse to budge further. Taking this offer minimizes the risk of losing a sale and ensures a good profit."
