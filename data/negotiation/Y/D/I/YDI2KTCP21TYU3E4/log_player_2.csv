Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $700,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
