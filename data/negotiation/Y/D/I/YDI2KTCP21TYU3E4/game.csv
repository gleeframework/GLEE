"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is a bit out of my price range at the moment. I could do $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $700,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer for now.",900000.0,Alice,5,
