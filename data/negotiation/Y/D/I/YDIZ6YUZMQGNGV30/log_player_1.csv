"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and might even result in you getting a price closer to your ideal.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** By starting high, you can gauge how interested Bob is in the product. If he outright rejects the offer, you know you need to come down significantly. If he counter-offers, you can get a better feel for his price range.
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have John as a backup who's willing to pay $120. This means you don't have to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Bob. Selling to John guarantees you get your desired price without the risk of further negotiation."
