"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $90, which is a good deal, but not the best.
* You can get the product for $100 from John.
* **Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $100.**"
