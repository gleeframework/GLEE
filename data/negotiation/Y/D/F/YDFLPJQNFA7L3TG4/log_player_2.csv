# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Buying from Alice saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **The product is worth more to you than to Alice.** You value it at $1,200,000, and she's willing to sell it for $1,000,000. This means there's room for a mutually beneficial deal. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to maximize savings while still acquiring the product."
