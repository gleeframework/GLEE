"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's tempting to save $100,000, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down further. He can also use John's offer as a baseline for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, knowing its value to you. I believe this is a fair price, allowing us both to come out ahead."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more in line with your budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  Alice has come down significantly, but he's still closer to his goal of $950,000.  He can likely get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget. I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly above your last offer. How about $1,020,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice has come down further, he's still only $20,000 away from his target of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can use John's offer as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,010,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,080,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is coming down in price, she's still not close enough to his target.  John's offer provides a guaranteed price that meets Bob's goal.  With only a few rounds remaining, there's a risk that Alice may not be willing to come down further, and Bob could end up paying more than he wants."
