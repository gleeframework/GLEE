"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, knowing its value to you. I believe this is a fair price, allowing us both to come out ahead.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more in line with your budget. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget. I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly above your last offer. How about $1,020,000?",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,010,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",1010000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,080,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
