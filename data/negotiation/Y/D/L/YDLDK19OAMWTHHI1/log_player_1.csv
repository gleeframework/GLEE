"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you do $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing Bob a little further to see if he'll budge closer to the $800,000 mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $825,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. There's no benefit to potentially jeopardizing the deal by negotiating further, especially since we have John's offer as a fallback option."
