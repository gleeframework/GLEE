""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you'd like to purchase it!"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good practice to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's valuation is $120, significantly lower than yours. By starting at $170, you can quickly gauge Bob's level of interest. If he's willing to negotiate down from there, you have room to work with. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John. This gives you leverage in your negotiation with Bob. You are not pressured to accept any offer below that.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always propose a lower price, gradually moving closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150)."
