(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking for $110. While this is close to your limit, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get the product for closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $120, offering $105 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $110, showing you're serious about negotiating.  It also leaves room for a potential compromise if Alice counters back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $108, which is only $3 more than your counteroffer. This is a good deal, considering you're willing to pay up to $120.  Accepting the offer saves you time and the potential hassle of further negotiation."
