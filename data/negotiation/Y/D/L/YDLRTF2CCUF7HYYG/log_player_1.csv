I'm aiming for a higher price than $10,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm firm on $11,000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $10,750 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting very close. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm taking the risk of losing a deal altogether and accepting his offer."
