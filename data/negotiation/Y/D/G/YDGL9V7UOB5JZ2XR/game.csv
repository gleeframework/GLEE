"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me. Could we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
