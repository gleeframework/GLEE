"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8500.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $8500 is still a bit above my limit. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll offer $8250, which is closer to where I'm comfortable.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $8350, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8350.0,Alice,5,
