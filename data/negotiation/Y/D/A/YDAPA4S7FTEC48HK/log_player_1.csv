"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is more than what the product is worth to me, but still lower than its value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum selling price of $80.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to ensure I get at least my minimum value for the product.  I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $85 is a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired selling price while still being somewhat attractive to Bob.  I'm also showing flexibility by splitting the difference between our last offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is within my acceptable range and is a fair compromise.  I'd rather close the deal now and get a good price than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
