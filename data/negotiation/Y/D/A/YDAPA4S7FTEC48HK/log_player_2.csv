"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is within your budget, you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to quickly establish a lower range.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm indicating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. $85 is a fair starting point considering Alice's minimum value is $80. 
* **Openness:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by ending with a question, prompting Alice to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $85 is a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $92.50 is still too high.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting keeps the negotiation going and allows me to continue trying to get a lower price. 
* **Risk:**  While I could buy from John, there's still room to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This strategy shows I'm willing to compromise while staying within my budget.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing $90 as a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence helps set a positive tone and encourages Alice to accept."
