"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will more than justify the price. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $850,000 for the product, as I can get it from John for $800,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John instead.
