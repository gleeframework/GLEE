"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, given its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a very fair offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John at $12,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and he might end up stuck with John's price. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to John and is a reasonable compromise."
