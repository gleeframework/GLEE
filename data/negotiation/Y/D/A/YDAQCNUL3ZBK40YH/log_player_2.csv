Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better deal from Alice in further rounds, and it's best to secure the product at the desired price."
