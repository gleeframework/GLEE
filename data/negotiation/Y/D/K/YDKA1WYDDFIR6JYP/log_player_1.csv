{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

While I'm close to a deal with Bob, I've only got 4 rounds left. I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement within that timeframe.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and it's the best way to ensure I get the most money for my product."
