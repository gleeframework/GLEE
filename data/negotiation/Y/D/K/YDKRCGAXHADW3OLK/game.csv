"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the product's value. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true worth is closer to my initial price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while ensuring I get a valuable product at a reasonable price. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my desire to move forward with the deal while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. While I value the product and want to make this deal work, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
