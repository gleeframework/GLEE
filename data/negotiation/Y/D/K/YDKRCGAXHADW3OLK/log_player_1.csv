Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while ensuring I get a valuable product at a reasonable price. Let's work together to make this deal happen.
