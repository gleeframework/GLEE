"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is $8,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum price point, and there's room for negotiation. He should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into preparing it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He should aim for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the value I place on the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go down to $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,200 and $8,000. I can offer you the product for $8,100. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product and the effort I've put into preparing it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Here's why:

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $8,100.  Further negotiation might lead to more rounds without a satisfying outcome.
* **Time Constraint:**  Bob has a limited number of rounds.  He doesn't want to risk getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is Bob's target. 

It's always wise to secure a deal that meets your needs, especially when there's a viable alternative available."
