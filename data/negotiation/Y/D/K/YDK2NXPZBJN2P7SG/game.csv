"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into preparing it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the value I place on the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go down to $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,200 and $8,000. I can offer you the product for $8,100. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product and the effort I've put into preparing it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8100.0,Alice,5,
