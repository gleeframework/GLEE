Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her initial price, and we're now within striking distance of my ideal price point.  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product at a significant discount to John's price."
