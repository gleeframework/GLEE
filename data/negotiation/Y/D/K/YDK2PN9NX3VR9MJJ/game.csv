"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
