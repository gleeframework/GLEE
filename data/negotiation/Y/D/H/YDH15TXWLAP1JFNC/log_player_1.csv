Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, trying to get closer to that with Bob is ideal.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting with $1,100,000, we signal:
    * The product's high value.
    * That we have other interested buyers (creating urgency).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price higher than $800,000 (his perceived value) but still lower than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging the risk that he might reject the offer."
