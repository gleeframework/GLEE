"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,400. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",12400.0,Alice,5,
