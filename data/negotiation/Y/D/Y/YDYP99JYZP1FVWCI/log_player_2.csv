"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120. This price is still above Alice's value of $80, so there's room for a potential deal. By offering a lower price, I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to accept my counteroffer, saving me $20 compared to her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $130 is a better deal than buying from John for $150. While I would prefer to pay less, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me $20 compared to buying from John."
