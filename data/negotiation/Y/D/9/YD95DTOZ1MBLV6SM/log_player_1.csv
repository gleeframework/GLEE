Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Strong but Polite Language:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. 
 
**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $10,000."
