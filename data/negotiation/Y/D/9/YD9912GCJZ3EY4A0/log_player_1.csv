Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell yourself short.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" can create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open to discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer without feeling alienated by an overly aggressive initial price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), you might adjust your approach accordingly.
* **Market Information:** While not explicitly stated, any additional market knowledge (like typical profit margins for similar products) could further inform your pricing strategy."
