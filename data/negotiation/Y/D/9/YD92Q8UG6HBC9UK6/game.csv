"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000.
