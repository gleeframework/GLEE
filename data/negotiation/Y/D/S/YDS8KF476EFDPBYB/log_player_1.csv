{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $8,000, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're leaving room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **It shows confidence:** This offer indicates you believe in the value of your product and are willing to stand your ground. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to save some money. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than $8,000, it's still far below the value I know the product has. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500,  which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  It seems Bob is motivated to buy the product, and I'm confident I can reach a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $10,000. This is a fair price that accounts for the value of the product and my time invested.  If you're serious about buying, I believe this is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,500 is a significant improvement over John's offer of $8,000. Bob seems serious about buying and is willing to meet me halfway, so I'll accept his offer and move on."
