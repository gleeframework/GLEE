"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I believe it offers tremendous value, and I'm happy to begin discussions at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's a good starting point,  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his desired price. Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, so rejecting this offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his goal of $800,000.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
