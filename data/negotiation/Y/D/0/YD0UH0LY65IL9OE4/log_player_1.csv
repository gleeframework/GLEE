Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal fairly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you a significant profit. Let's reach a deal and close this negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $900,000. While I would prefer a bit more, it's a good price and ensures I make a profit.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to sell to John for a lower price."
