"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's below your maximum budget, you have room to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal fairly.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you a significant profit. Let's reach a deal and close this negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}
