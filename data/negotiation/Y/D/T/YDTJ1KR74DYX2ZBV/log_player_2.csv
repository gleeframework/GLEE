"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should counteroffer or look for a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still more than he wants to pay. Bob should continue negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,500. I'll offer you the product for $15,200. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.

Bob has been negotiating hard, but Alice is not budging much. At this point, it's worth it for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $12,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further potential haggling with Alice."
