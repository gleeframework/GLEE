"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $100 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This still gives you a great deal on a product worth $150 to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
