"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'd like to counteroffer at $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really making this a tough decision! I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I could do $7,800, which is a significant jump from my last offer.  That's the best I can do.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,800 is a good offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,800, which would be $8,150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",8150.0,Alice,7,
