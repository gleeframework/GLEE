"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer significantly below my maximum price allows room for negotiation and gauges Alice's willingness to lower her price.  It's a starting point to see how much we can bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down significantly, $9,000 is still above your maximum price and John's offer. There's still room for negotiation to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Compromise:** Offering $7,500 shows a willingness to compromise while still staying below your maximum budget. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is $500 below John's offer, potentially motivating Alice to accept before you resort to the alternative option. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** It keeps the negotiation open, giving you more opportunities to potentially secure a better deal than John's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'd like to counteroffer at $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting close to your limit, but it's still above both your target price and John's offer. It's worth one more attempt to negotiate a better price before accepting defeat or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really making this a tough decision! I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I could do $7,800, which is a significant jump from my last offer.  That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This offer is a calculated risk, going slightly above John's price but still within your budget. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating it's your ""best and final"" offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious and might walk away if she doesn't accept. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:** Getting the product for $7,800 is a win, saving you $200 compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,800 is a good offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,800, which would be $8,150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $8,000.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate her down further, and at this point, John's offer of $8,000 is the better deal. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
