"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price, so let me know if it's something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  Even though I'm interested in the product, it's not worth paying more than my limit.  At this point, it's best to buy from John, who's offering a price I can afford."
