"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's value of $8,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it signals Bob's intention to negotiate seriously. It's a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice room to negotiate while still giving Bob a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.  It's still a bit higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob losing the opportunity to buy the product from John.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to John's offer."
