"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and we can close the deal.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $97.50. This feels like a reasonable compromise between our previous offers.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering your product's value and my budget, I would like to suggest a price of $98. I believe this is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach an agreement.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $98 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $99?  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know if this works for you.",99.0,Alice,7,
