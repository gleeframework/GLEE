"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less than $11,000, and he wants to save as much money as possible.  He can counteroffer or move on to John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This product truly offers exceptional value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's still willing to pay less than $10,250, and he wants to save as much money as possible. He can counteroffer with a lower price and see if Alice will budge. He should only buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $10,250.  How about $10,000?  That seems like a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
