"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",9500.0,Bob,4,
