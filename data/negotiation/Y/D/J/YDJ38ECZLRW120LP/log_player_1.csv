While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit low. I'm going to hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get Bob to come up a little more.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still interested in selling to you, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
