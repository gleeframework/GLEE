"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll love. I'm starting with a price of $12,000, but I'm open to negotiating. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still interested in selling to you, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
