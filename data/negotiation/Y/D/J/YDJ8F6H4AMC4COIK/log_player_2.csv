"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you have a $1,000 buffer before reaching John's price. By rejecting this offer, you can gauge Alice's willingness to go lower and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. 

* **Starting Low:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to start lower than your desired price to give yourself bargaining space.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but firmly states your price limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $11,000, you're aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value ($10,000) while staying well below your maximum ($15,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $11,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $12,500 is still a significant markup from her $10,000 valuation. There's room to push for a better price. We'll aim to meet closer to the middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($11,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($12,500). It signals willingness to compromise while still striving for a better price.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While you're moving closer to her price, you're not simply accepting her counteroffer. This shows you're still looking for a good deal.
* **Psychological Element:** Offering an uneven number like $11,750 can sometimes make it seem more considered and less like a simple round number counter."
