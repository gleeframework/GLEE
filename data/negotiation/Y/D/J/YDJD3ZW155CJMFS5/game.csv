,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $102, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,7,,
