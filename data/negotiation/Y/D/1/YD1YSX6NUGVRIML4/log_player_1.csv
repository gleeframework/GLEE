Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potential for higher profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, I can adjust accordingly.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $80. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and take the guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent profit, I have room to negotiate. Bob's offer indicates he's very interested. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise and might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By moving closer to his offer, I can gauge how much he's willing to budge. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** $115 is still a significant profit margin for me, keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $105 is a good profit, exceeding my minimum by $25. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above this offer. It's unlikely Bob will jump to $115 from here.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further back-and-forth and potential for losing the sale altogether."
