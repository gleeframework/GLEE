"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $850,000? This price is still well above your value, and it allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves a decent margin for Alice. 
* **Appealing to Alice's Needs:**  Highlighting that Bob is offering a price above Alice's value emphasizes the potential win for Alice. 
* **Setting a Strong Starting Point:** A lower starting point makes it easier for Bob to negotiate down further in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, Bob can still potentially secure a better price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffers:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob maintains leverage and can continue to push for a lower price. 
* **Avoid Overpaying:**  Accepting $900,000 would mean paying $100,000 more than Alice's value, which is more than Bob would like to spend."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to close the deal closer to my initial offer. How about $875,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to finalize the transaction quickly. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's previous offer, showing flexibility while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  A small increase in the counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower to $890,000. This price is a good balance between our needs, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Target:**  Alice's offer of $890,000 is only $90,000 above Alice's value, which is very close to Bob's ideal outcome.
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but the potential savings are minimal and the risk of Alice walking away or further delaying the deal is high.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only five rounds remaining, it's important to secure the deal while still getting a reasonable price. Buying from John at $1,000,000 would be a significant overpayment."
