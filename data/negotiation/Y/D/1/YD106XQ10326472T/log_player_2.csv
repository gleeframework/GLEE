"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $13,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for his maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold counteroffer, but it establishes Bob's firm position and forces Alice to consider a significant price drop."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a significant difference. There are still rounds left, and Bob should try to push for a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  $9,000 is a compromise between his maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is willing to negotiate but is also serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $9,500, which is just $500 above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. This is a good deal considering Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away, or requiring more rounds before reaching a similar price.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
