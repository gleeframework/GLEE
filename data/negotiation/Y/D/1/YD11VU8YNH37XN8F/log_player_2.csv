```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us,  allowing you a good profit while providing me a significant saving."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $887,500? That's a solid compromise and ensures we both walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's well below his initial target of $1,000,000 and allows him to save a significant amount of money.  At this point, it's reasonable for Bob to accept the offer. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it's not guaranteed, and the risk of not closing the deal increases."
