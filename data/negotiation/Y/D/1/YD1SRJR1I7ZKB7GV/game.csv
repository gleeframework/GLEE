"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",775000.0,Alice,5,
