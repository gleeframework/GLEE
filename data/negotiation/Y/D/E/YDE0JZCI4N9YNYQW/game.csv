"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm ready to offer $1150000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1150000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1250000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1190000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
