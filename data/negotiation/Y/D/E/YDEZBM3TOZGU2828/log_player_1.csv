Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $80 but below my minimum price of $100.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. It's important to remember that John is a backup buyer, but I want to maximize my earnings with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $100.  I need to negotiate further.  John is a backup option, but I will try to get closer to my minimum price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my ideal price, but it's above my minimum of $100 and  closer to my desired outcome.  It's important to consider the potential for further negotiation, but accepting this offer is the most financially beneficial choice right now.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, and selling to John would result in less profit."
