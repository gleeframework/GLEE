Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offers are getting too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $975,000, and he seems unwilling to budge above $920,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and that's the most important thing."
