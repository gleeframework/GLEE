Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.  This information is helpful, but we shouldn't anchor our offer solely on this.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to $19,000 as possible. Starting high gives us room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $15,000. This means we should not accept anything less than this amount from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $19,000, we leave space for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet us somewhere in the middle. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he needs the product."
