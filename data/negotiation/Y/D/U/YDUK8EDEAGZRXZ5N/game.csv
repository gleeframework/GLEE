"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $152. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $152 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $145. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $150. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $142. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",142.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $150, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it's non-negotiable. I'll sell it to you for $149. This is my final offer.",149.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $149 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make one more attempt to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $142 and $149, which would be $145.50. Can you consider that?",145.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to budge from my original offer of $149. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think it's time to walk away and consider other offers. I'll sell the product to John for $150 if you're not willing to meet me at my price.",149.0,Alice,9,
