"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have several rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can likely get a better price than Bob's current offer.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I'm aware that selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still too low for me.
