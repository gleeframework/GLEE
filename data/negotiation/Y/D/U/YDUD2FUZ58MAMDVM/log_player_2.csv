Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I can't go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $95?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further to $85, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, meeting your goal of spending no more than that. It makes sense to take the guaranteed deal rather than risk Alice not budging further."
