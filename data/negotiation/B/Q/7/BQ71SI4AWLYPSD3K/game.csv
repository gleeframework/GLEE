"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $16000 to feel comfortable. How about we talk about $13500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm encouraged that we're getting closer.  $13500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to go to $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product today.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than that. This is as close to my minimum price as I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
