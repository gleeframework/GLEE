{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150) but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While I'm willing to sell for $150, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $160? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155? I really want this product, but I just can't afford more than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob is willing to pay $155, which is more than what John is offering, I will accept his offer and sell him the product. I'm happy to get a price closer to my initial asking price, and this is a good outcome for me."
