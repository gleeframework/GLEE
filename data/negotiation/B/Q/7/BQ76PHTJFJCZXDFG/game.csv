"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",25000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, $25000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,18000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $18000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $18000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $12000 for the product.  This would allow me to purchase it while staying within my financial limits. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we discuss a price of $16000? It's still a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",16000.0,Alice,5,,
