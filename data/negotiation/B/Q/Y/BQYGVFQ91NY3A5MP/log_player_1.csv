{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting or making a counteroffer.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message helps establish a rapport and keeps the negotiation open and positive. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly suggesting that he's getting a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've earned $10,000.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* If negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive, I'll switch to John, who is guaranteed to buy for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8000. Would it be possible for you to consider this lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** While Bob's initial offer is low, he acknowledged the value of the product. This indicates that he might be willing to increase his offer if I push back.
* **John's Guaranteed Deal:** I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or at least higher than his initial offer. I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate while keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't cover my costs for this product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still give you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price but still lower than John's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **Empathy and Compromise:** My message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while suggesting a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** Keeping the conversation friendly and focused on a solution helps avoid any potential animosity.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll have earned $9,000.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or switch to John. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan, ensuring I don't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8500 for your product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would mean a significant financial loss.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, which provides a safety net. It's important to not get caught up in a negotiation that might lead to a suboptimal outcome.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance he might raise his offer again if I reject his current proposal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate while keeping John's offer as a safety net."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While $8,500 is closer, it still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.
