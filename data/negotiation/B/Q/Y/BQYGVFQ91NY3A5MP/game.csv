"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8000. Would it be possible for you to consider this lower price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8000 just doesn't cover my costs for this product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? This would still give you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8500 for your product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While $8500 is closer, it still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $9500, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise. While $9000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $10500. This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,7,
