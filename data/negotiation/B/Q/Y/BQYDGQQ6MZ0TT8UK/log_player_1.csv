Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $10,000, so you have room to go lower if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and provides a reason for the price. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep the negotiation going. If Bob rejects, you can counter with a lower price, but you'll need to be strategic to avoid ending up with John's offer, which is your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product and I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired value of $10,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a great price for a product that you value highly. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,250. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,250 is close to my minimum. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering the time and effort involved in negotiating. I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
