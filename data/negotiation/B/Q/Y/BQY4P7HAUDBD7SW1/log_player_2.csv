"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It aligns perfectly with your needs and has the potential to significantly impact your business. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you can get the product from John for the same price ($1,000,000), there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting her offer keeps your options open, potentially allowing you to negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
