Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I would be happy to sell the product for $80, I believe I can do better.  Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to see if I can get a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise and higher than what John is offering. I'm going to accept it."
