"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer of $10,000. However, I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
