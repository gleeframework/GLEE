# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but it's still above her valuation. We can push a little further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer of $10,000. However, I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could try to push further, there's a risk she'll walk away. Accepting at $11,500 ensures we get the product at a price significantly below John's offer."
