"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. He has a significant buffer between his maximum price ($1,000,000) and Alice's offer ($950,000). By counter-offering, he can try to negotiate a lower price and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to aggressively negotiate a lower price, starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. He's using the fact that he has a higher maximum price than Alice's minimum price to his advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a position to negotiate. Alice has come down from her initial offer, but there's still room to bargain.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can potentially get a price closer to his target of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer from $850,000 to $875,000, showing he's willing to negotiate, but still trying to stay below Alice's current offer of $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise without giving up too much."
