"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
