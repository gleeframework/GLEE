Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from another party."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to limit ourselves. Starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding the asking price and introduces a sense of urgency with the mention of another buyer (John). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. This keeps the door open for a deal even if Bob isn't immediately sold at the initial price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you are comfortable walking away from a deal with Bob if he doesn't meet your price expectations. You have a guaranteed sale with John.
* Observe Bob's reaction carefully.  If he seems unreceptive to negotiation, you can subtly adjust your approach in subsequent communication."
