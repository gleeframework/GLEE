"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $6,500. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5,800. Can you meet me there?",5800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $6,200? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",6200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,000 and $5,800, which would be $5,900. Can you consider that?",5900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $6,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",6100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $6,100 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,100 and $5,800, which would be $5,950. Can you consider that?",5950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $6,100. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though. How about I include a premium warranty and a personalized consultation to help you get the most out of the product? Would that make it more appealing to you?",6100.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,100 and $5,700, which would be $5,900. Can you consider that?",5900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the deal. How about I meet you halfway between $6,100 and $5,900, which would be $5,950? If you're still not happy, I'll have to consider other options.",5950.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $5,800. I'm starting to think that I should just go with John's offer of $8,000, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. Can you meet me at $5,800?",5800.0,Bob,10,
