Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still keeping us well above our minimum. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 (Bob's maximum) might be seen as too aggressive and could backfire. 
* **Secure a Deal:** We need to offer a price attractive enough that Bob is likely to accept, knowing we have a fallback option with John."
