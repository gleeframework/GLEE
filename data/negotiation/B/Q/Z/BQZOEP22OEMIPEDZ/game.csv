"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This price reflects the value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $860,000, which is a fair compromise considering our both our needs.  Let's try to close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",870000.0,Alice,5,
