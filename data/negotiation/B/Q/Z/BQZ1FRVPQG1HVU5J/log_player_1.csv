{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $77.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $76? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $76. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $76
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $76 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident that Bob will budge further.  I'd rather sell to John for the guaranteed $80 and avoid further negotiation."
