"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you for a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, we can discuss the details further. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
