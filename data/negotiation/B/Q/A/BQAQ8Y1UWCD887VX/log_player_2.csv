"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This gives us both some room to negotiate and ensures a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  While it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's also worth noting that Bob could buy the product from John for $12,000, so he has an alternative if he's unable to reach a deal with Alice.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice may allow Bob to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
