"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my research and budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  However, $950000 is unfortunately below the minimum I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1100000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've given your proposal careful consideration. While I respect the value of the product, I am still unable to commit to a price higher than $1000000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the current market conditions and my financial capacity. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
