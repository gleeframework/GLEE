Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth $120 to you, so you should reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $160. What do you think?

While $160 is closer to your target, it's still more than what you're willing to pay.  You should try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $152. What do you think?

You are very close to your goal of $120, but $152 is still too high.  It is worth trying to get Alice down a little more."
