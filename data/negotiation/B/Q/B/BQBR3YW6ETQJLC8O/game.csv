"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105.  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better.  Let me know what you think!",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great price for a fantastic product, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $107.50? That way we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid going with John.",107.5,Bob,4,
