"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll gain. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer. I really need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
