Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn a decent profit. I'm hopeful Bob will find the product valuable enough to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable value, I believe the product is worth more than $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This should hopefully be a fair compromise and encourage Bob to come up a bit from his initial offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum acceptable value. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll reach an impasse. To avoid further time and effort, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000. This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal."
