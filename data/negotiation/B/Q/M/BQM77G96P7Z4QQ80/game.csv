"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept and still make a reasonable profit.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $9,000 is really my limit. If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
