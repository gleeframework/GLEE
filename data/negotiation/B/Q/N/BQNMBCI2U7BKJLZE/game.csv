"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $7,500 is the right number for me, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $8,000, Bob. However, I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",8200.0,Alice,9,
