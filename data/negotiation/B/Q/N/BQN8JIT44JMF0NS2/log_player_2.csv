You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

The product is worth $15,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $18,000.  This is a bad deal for Bob. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Bob's goal is to spend no more than $8,000.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high.  It's better for Bob to buy from John for $8,000, as that fits his budget and saves him $5,500."
