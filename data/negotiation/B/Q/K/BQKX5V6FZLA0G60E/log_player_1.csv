Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects our mutual interest in getting this deal done. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While moving closer to Bob's price might encourage him, it's too early to concede that much of the potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between the previous offer and my walk-away price ($1,200,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000. This is a good compromise that reflects our desire to reach an agreement. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing in later rounds."
