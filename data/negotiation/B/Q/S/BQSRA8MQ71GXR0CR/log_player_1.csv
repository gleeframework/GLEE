"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial offer is very low, so I'm going to try and push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $20,000 in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. $16,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a further compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle and close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000, Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good deal. This is significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000 and only a little lower than my last counteroffer of $17,000.  Given that we are nearing the end of the negotiation process, it's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
