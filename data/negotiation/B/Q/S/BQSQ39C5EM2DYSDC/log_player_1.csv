Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe we can still do better. I will counteroffer Bob and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. I believe this price is fair considering the value Bob places on the product. It's also important to keep in mind that selling to John for $8,000 is always an option if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. This is a good deal for me, and it seems Bob is unlikely to offer a higher price."
