"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to move forward with the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. My revised offer is $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My final offer is $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping you'll consider it.",800000.0,Bob,4,
