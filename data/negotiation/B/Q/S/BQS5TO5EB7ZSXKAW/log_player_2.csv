Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still fair, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  This is the best price he's gotten from Alice and is still within his budget.  While he could try to counter again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Buying from John would cost him more."
