Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $1,150,000 is less than Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:**  By not offering the product at the lowest possible price, you show you believe in the value of your product.

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation to occur and increases your chance of getting closer to Bob's maximum value without risking a complete breakdown of the negotiation."
