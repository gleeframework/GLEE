"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, it's a gamble.  I'll be ready to adjust based on his response."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $800,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. It's important to be flexible during negotiations, but I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still above my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm  meeting Bob halfway with this counteroffer.  I'm trying to find a price that is reasonable for both of us and hopefully will lead to a deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a deal. To avoid risking losing any profit, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a guaranteed sale."
