"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its value to you, and I'll be getting a price that's well above my minimum. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000.  This price still gives you a significant discount and is closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
