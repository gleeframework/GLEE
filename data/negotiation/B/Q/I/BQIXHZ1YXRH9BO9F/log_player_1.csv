Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further but $10,000 is unacceptable."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and I can make a profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
