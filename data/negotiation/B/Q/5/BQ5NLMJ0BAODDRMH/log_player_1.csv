Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob without directly mentioning the $80 value he places on it. This avoids giving him too much information."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob has shown interest, his offer is too low, but he is willing to negotiate. This means there's potential for a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Exploring Options:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price range.  Selling to John is a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $80 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to work with you. How about $95?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that is a step towards his price but still above my minimum.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise, emphasizing the discount from my initial offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and showing a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to continue the conversation.
* **Motivation:**  $95 is a reasonable compromise, and  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it as it's a win-win situation."
