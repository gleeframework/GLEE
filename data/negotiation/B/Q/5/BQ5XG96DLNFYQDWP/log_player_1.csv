"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and encourage a positive response. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 to avoid immediately alienating Bob and to allow for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while leaving room for compromise. I'll be watching Bob's reaction carefully and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob has come up from his initial value, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there is room for further negotiation. I'm willing to risk losing a few rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Strategic use of John:**  John's offer of $15,000 serves as a safety net, allowing me to take calculated risks in negotiation with Bob without fearing a significant loss.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price while keeping in mind the value Bob places on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still lower than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,500. This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price point. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it still leaves space for Bob to counteroffer if he's truly interested.

This counteroffer balances the need to secure a good price with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward. I'm prepared to either accept a counteroffer in the next round if it's close to my target or go another round to try and push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $13,500 is still above my limit.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is being persistent, his offer remains below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have several rounds left, and John's offer provides a strong fallback option if I fail to reach a satisfactory deal with Bob. 
* **Potential for a better offer:** I believe there's still a chance to convince Bob to pay closer to my target price. I'm not ready to settle for $12,500, especially since I know the product is worth more to me.

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to increase the price while maintaining a negotiating tone. I'm confident that a bit more pressure and persistence could lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's settle on $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making a final concession, offering $13,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  I've reduced the negotiating range, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

By offering a final compromise and highlighting the value of the product, I aim to convince Bob to accept the deal.  If he refuses, I'm prepared to consider my options with John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has come up a bit, his offer of $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is a better option:**  I've already made significant concessions, and with only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to get closer to my desired price. John's offer of $15,000 is significantly better, and I'm confident I can secure that deal.
* **Risk of stalemate:**  If I accept Bob's offer, I'm essentially settling for a price that is significantly below my minimum.  There's also a risk that Bob will continue to make small counteroffers, leading to a stalemate and wasting valuable negotiation rounds.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, but I'm prepared to sell to John if the next round doesn't yield a better result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However,  $12,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go one last time to $13,250. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. If you're serious about getting this product, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This is my final counteroffer, aiming to push the price closer to my desired range while acknowledging Bob's financial constraints. 
* **High Stakes:** I'm making a final push, leaving little room for further negotiation.  
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on to John, as the potential loss is now minimal compared to the risk of settling for a significantly lower price. This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome, even if it means walking away from the deal with Bob."
