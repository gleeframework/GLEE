# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum and allows you to save $100,000. This is a better deal than buying from John."
