"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that aims to maximize my profit while still being appealing to Bob. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds. I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John for $15,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $12,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,250. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,250 is close to my minimum, I still have time to try and negotiate a better price. I think I can still push for something closer to $13,500.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your frustration, and I'm also ready to close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13,400.  That's just a little bit more than your last offer, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's call it a day and get this done!"", ""product_price"": 13400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $13,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting too close to my minimum, and it seems like Bob might not be willing to budge much further. I've reached the point where I'm more comfortable selling to John and securing the guaranteed $15,000.  It's important to know my limits and when it's best to take a certain profit than risk losing it all on the chance of a slightly higher price."
