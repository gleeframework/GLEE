"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is higher than your maximum budget of $150. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer of $110 gives you some room to negotiate upwards while still staying below your maximum budget. The message aims to be polite and express continued interest while making it clear you're looking for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $130. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $130 is still above your ideal price.  There's room to negotiate further, especially since you're willing to go up to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be direct:**  You're proposing a specific price that works for you.
* **Highlight fairness:** By mentioning it's a fair deal for both sides, you're appealing to a sense of compromise.
* **Stay firm:** You're signaling that you're serious about this price, while leaving Alice room to accept.

If Alice rejects this, you're getting close to your walk-away point."
