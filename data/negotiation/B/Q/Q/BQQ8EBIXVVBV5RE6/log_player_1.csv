Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The high price will help me gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have gone even higher. If he negotiates, I can adjust accordingly.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $80, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while being open to finding a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial rejection wasn't a strong ""no,"" suggesting he's still interested. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but above my minimum to aim for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming higher than his $90. 
* **Justification:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise and encouraging him to agree.
* **Profit Margin:** This price point still gives me a significant profit margin while hopefully being within Bob's range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $95 is a good offer, exceeding my minimum by $15. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might lose interest.
* **Time Value:** Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures a good profit without further delay.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try for more with Bob, there's always a chance the negotiations could break down. Accepting a guaranteed $95 outweighs the potential risk of ending up with John's $80 offer."
