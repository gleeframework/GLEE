"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However,  $1,050,000 is still too far off from where I need to be. To show you I'm serious about working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
