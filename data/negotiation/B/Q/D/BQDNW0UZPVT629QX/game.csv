"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $13500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12750? That's the best I can do.",12750.0,Bob,4,
