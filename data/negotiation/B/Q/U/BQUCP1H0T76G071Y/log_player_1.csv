"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message frames the high price with terms like ""value"" and ""potential,"" subtly suggesting the product is worth more than Bob might think.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting point for us to negotiate"" makes it clear I'm willing to discuss the price further. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Establish a high initial value in Bob's mind.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to see how flexible he might be.
3. **Maintain Options:**  Keep the negotiation open while leaving the possibility of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** While I am making a significant reduction from my initial price, I am still staying well above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's worth and frames the price reduction as a significant concession on my part. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my price range.  If he remains firmly below $1,500,000 in the next round, I might consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a ways off from what I had in mind. How about $1,200,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still under. Since we're only on round 4, and Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer significantly, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'll counter with an offer closer to my minimum but leave myself space for one more round of negotiation if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's settle this - I can come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer. It's a great deal for a product that can bring you so much value."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm making a significant move towards Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling I'm unwilling to go much lower. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the price.

This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He can either accept a price significantly higher than his initial offer but below my initial ask, or he risks losing the deal. If he rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John for my guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain, but I'm serious about this product.  Your final offer is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to my guaranteed sale price of $1,500,000 from John. While I could push for a bit more, the difference is relatively small at this point. 

Accepting this offer:

* **Secures a Strong Profit:** I'm still selling the product for significantly more than Bob initially offered and above his perceived value.
* **Avoids Further Risk:**  There's a chance Bob might withdraw his offer or I might miscalculate in further negotiation, leading to a less favorable outcome. 
* **Ends Negotiation Quickly:** This allows me to move on without potentially lengthy back-and-forths."
