Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'm tempted by the security of selling to John, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I can't go as low as $8,000, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow me to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as what John is offering, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting further offers."
