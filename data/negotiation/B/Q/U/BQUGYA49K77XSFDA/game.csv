"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the compromise, Alice.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and reflects my ability to purchase it quickly.  Let's work together to reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
