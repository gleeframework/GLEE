It's not worth paying $90 when you can get it for $80 from John.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $85 is still more than I want to pay. I'm going to counteroffer again."

I'm going to offer Alice $80, which is my maximum price.  It's a fair price for her and a good deal for me. Hopefully, she'll accept."
