"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it,  given my budget constraints.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident that this product will generate substantial returns for you.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
