"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to offer $14,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This price reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $16,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $15,500, which is a fair compromise given our both our positions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
