Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the face value you mentioned earlier. Can we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
