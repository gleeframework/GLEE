Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great value at $95. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could yield more profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the discount from John's price might entice him.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
