Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
