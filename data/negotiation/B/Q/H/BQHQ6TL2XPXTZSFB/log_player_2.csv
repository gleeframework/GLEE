"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you at $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price. $950,000 is still too high for you, and you can potentially negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you and the effort I've put into creating it. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise and is still within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying the same amount to John."
