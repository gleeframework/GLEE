"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $80, so rejecting the initial offer is the best strategy to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think the product is great, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  This gives Alice room to counter while still providing Bob with a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $80 limit. While $100 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it is still above his maximum.  By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the negotiation going and continues to put pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $90.  I'm willing to offer $88 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's latest offer, pushing her to consider a price that is more favorable to him. By proposing a specific price, Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate in good faith."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay under $90, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is a great compromise. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is closer to Bob's target, he's still determined to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer $90 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now very close to his maximum budget and is showing a willingness to close the deal.  By stating this is his ""final offer,"" he puts pressure on Alice to accept and avoids unnecessary back and forth. This approach gives Alice a sense of urgency to make a decision, as further negotiation might lead to a loss of the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet at $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to his maximum budget.  Alice's final offer of $95 is too high for him, and he's concerned that further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth. 

Since he has the option to buy the product from John for $80, it's the most logical choice at this point. This ensures he gets the product for a price he's comfortable with and avoids potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation that might not result in a better deal."
