,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think the product is great, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $90.  I'm willing to offer $88 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay under $90, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is a great compromise. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer $90 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet at $95.",95.0,Alice,7,
