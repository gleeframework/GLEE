,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  $10000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $17500?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit as well.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're firm on your budget.  While $13000 is still lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to come down to $14000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope it's a fair offer for you as well.",14000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns.  $13500 is getting closer to where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $14000 one more time, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,7,
