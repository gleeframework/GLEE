"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product. Let's meet in the middle, how about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for your product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to go down to $10,125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still trying to get a good price for your product, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
