"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $11,500.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate, but it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, making it more attractive to Alice.
* **Balancing Risk:** While Bob could offer even lower, it increases the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially making a counteroffer closer to her initial price.  This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** At $11,000, Alice's offer is lower than the price John is offering ($12,000). 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to get a significantly lower price.** Bob has already made a counteroffer, and Alice is getting closer to his value threshold.  Further negotiation may just lead to more back-and-forth without a substantial improvement.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision to save money."
