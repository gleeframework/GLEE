Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $20,000 is higher than your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's not too high:**  A higher price might scare Bob off immediately. 
* **It's open-ended:** The message signals you're open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to try and get a bit closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $20,000.  How about $19,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $19000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17500. Can we consider that a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $17,500 is a fair compromise, especially considering the risk of further negotiation. It's closer to my desired range than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of Bob backing out entirely."
