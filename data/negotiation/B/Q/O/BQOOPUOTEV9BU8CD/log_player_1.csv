"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. If you're open to that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum, and it's likely we won't be able to negotiate much further. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
