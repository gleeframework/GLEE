Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to make this transaction particularly smooth for you and am proposing a price of $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours before I move forward with other interested parties. "",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still nets a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. It incentivizes him to act while still respecting the product's worth.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision without excessive deliberation."
