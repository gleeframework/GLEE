"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer of $8,000. He knows Alice values the product at $10,000, so this price is a good starting point for negotiation. It's low enough to give him a good deal, but not so low that Alice will immediately reject it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further with Alice.  He might be able to get the price down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,000. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good price. He's hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's closer to her valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget and only $1,000 less than what John is offering. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000 to ensure he gets the best deal possible within his budget."
