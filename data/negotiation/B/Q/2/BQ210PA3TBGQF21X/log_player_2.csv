"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above his $8,000 limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price close to his maximum limit, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and signals Bob's seriousness about getting a deal, but doesn't immediately close the deal if Alice is unwilling to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, which is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his limit.  Considering there are only 7 rounds left, it's a good opportunity to secure the product at a price that's not too far from his target. It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a deal entirely."
