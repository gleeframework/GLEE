Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's offer ($1,400,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested. We can always negotiate down slightly from $1,400,000 and still earn more than selling to John. 

This approach balances maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to seriously consider."
