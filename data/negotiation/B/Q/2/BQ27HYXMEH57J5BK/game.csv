"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your number, but $9,800 still doesn't quite work for me. How about $10,200? That's a significant reduction from my original offer, and I'm really hoping we can close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $9,500? That's my best offer so far, and I'm hoping you can meet me there.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting really close now. I can't go any lower than $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
