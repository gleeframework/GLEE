,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $140? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the compromise, but I am still looking to stay within $120. Could we perhaps meet closer to my budget at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence in staying within your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $137? It's a small step closer to your target, but still a fair price for the product.",137.0,Alice,5,
