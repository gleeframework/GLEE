"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us plenty of room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,700,000, still above my minimum value and hopefully closer to a point Bob might consider."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  While $1,400,000 is getting closer, I'm going to see if I can get even better in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit more to $1,600,000, trying to bridge the gap with Bob's offer. This is still above my minimum value, but I'm getting closer to a potential deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to making a deal with Bob, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk going below my minimum value. John is offering my desired price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
