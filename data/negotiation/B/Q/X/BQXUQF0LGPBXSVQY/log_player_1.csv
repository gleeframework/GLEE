Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Agreement:** There's a potential profit margin between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the zone of agreement, but not so high that Bob would rather walk away.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value and exclusivity, setting a positive tone.
* **Strong Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you a significant profit margin while still offering Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is your initial offer, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only how much it's *worth* to him. He might try to negotiate a lower price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup gives you leverage. You don't need to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
