"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $250 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $100? I'm interested in this item but need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $175? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the quality.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $125?  I think it's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $155? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,5,
