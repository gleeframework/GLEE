Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer gives Bob the impression there's room to negotiate downward, potentially leading to a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value might make Bob more receptive, even if the initial price seems high. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Depending on your negotiation style and your read on Bob, other strategies might be suitable."
