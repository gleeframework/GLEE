"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000. It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and open tone encourages Bob to respond.  Mentioning ""perfect for you"" implies some research on my end about his needs, which can build trust.  ""Open to negotiation"" signals flexibility, which is important for successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to go higher. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a lower price that's still within my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $13,500? I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest to maintain a positive tone. I acknowledge his offer but emphasize my desire for a higher price. Offering a specific counter-price ($13,500) shows I'm serious about negotiation. 
* **Price:** This counter-offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still keeping a profit margin. I also express my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price range. Considering I have 6 rounds remaining, it's strategically a good deal to accept this offer and avoid risking losing him as a buyer in the next rounds. It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
