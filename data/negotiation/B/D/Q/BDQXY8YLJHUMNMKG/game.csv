"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
