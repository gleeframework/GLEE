"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit lower than what I need. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,375? This way, we both get closer to our desired price. Let me know what you think.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll counteroffer $10,200. I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,200 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to make one final concession.  My absolute final offer is $10,300.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product.",10250.0,Bob,8,
