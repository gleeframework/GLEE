"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to you. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $90?
