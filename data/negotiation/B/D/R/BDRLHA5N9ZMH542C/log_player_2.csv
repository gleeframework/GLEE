I'm going to start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better deal."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not at a price I'm completely happy with. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still stay below her last offer. Hopefully this shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm still willing to negotiate."

Alice has come down a bit more, and while it's still not my ideal price, it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with John's higher price."
