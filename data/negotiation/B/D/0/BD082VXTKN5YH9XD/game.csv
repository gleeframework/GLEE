"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $9,000. This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's close this out and avoid wasting any more time.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm asking for $8,900. This is a compromise, and it still gives you a great deal on a product worth $10,000. Let's close this deal, but I need to stay above $8,800. ",8900.0,Alice,5,
