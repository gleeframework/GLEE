# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. While it's a good deal compared to its value to Alice, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer. He's already established a willingness to pay around $1,250,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $1,300,000. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.  While further negotiation is possible, Bob has already made two counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them. This suggests that Alice is unlikely to budge much further. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative of purchasing the product from John for $1,200,000, it's the most logical choice to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate."
