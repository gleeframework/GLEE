Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him if he buys from you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and you want to leverage this.

**Optimal Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It should be below his $1,200,000 valuation.
* **Maximizes Your Profit:**  Aim for the highest price Bob is likely to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, incentivizing him to accept.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the offer's fairness can make Bob more likely to accept it.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Bob could counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Don't reveal John's offer. It weakens your position. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a high likelihood of closing the deal with Bob."
