"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me in the middle at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $16000 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17000. Let's see if we can make this work.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500, which is the lowest I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $14500 is just too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $16000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
