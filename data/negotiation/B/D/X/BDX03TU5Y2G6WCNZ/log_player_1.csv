Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $115. I believe you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

I'm starting the negotiation at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value to leave room for bargaining while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's a good profit margin for me. By proposing a split the difference approach, I'm signalling a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto some of my advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $108 is about as high as I can go.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and $108 is a reasonable profit. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing the sale altogether."
