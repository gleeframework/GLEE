"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it'll be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
