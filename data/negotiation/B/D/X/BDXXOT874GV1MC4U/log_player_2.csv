# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it'll be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's meet in the middle.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
