"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above the product's value to her. This shows good faith and opens the door for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. While $11,000 is closer to his goal, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, he can try to push Alice further down in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. It's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his negotiation strategy. He's offering a price that's closer to his target and still leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer if she wants.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving while also ensuring Bob is getting a good deal."
