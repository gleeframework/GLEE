Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $19,000. I believe it provides significant value, even beyond your initial estimate. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""limited time,"" you create a sense of urgency and potential exclusivity, which might encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could experiment with different prices and messages to see what works best. There's always a chance Bob might accept a higher offer, but if he rejects it, you still have John as a reliable backup buyer."
