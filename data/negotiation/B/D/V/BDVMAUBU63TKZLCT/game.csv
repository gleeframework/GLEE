"Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $2,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,875,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1875000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,875,000 is quite a bit below my initial ask.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more than fair. To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This feels like a strong compromise, what do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must stay within my budget. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $2,000,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
