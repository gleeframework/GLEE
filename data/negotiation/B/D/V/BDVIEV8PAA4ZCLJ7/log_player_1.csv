Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,190,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) creates a sense of urgency and a potential bargain for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to your $1,200,000 minimum."
