"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it for $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000, which is Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price. Even if Alice doesn't come down, Bob can always buy from John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Initial Counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower price helps Bob establish his desired range.  $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, indicating Bob's serious interest in a lower price. 
* **Strategy:** This initial counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially open the door for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you consider $11000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and within Bob's budget.
* **Strategy:**  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John and $1,000 compared to his own counteroffer.  It's a good deal for Bob without risking losing the product or extending the negotiation further."
