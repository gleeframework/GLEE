"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum offer, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies above that. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I'm not able to go any higher. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
