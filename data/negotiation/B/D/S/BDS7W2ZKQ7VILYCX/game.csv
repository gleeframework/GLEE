"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. This allows for some room for negotiation and ensures both of us feel we are getting a beneficial deal.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $1,950,000 offer is still a significant gap from where I see this product's value. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to accept $2,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of this product.",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,900,000. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I propose we meet at $1,925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1925000.0,Bob,6,
