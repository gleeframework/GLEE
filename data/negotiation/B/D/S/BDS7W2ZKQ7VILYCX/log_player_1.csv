Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

``` 

While it's less than ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $1,925,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Trend:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, but his increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll dramatically move from his final offer.
* **Time:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiation.  Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer.
* **Profit:** $1,925,000 is a significant profit over John's standing offer of $1,500,000. 

Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower amount."
