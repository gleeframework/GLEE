# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to secure a better deal.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1300000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
