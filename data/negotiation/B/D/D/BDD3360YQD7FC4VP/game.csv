"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes the inherent value of the product while still offering you a significant gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
