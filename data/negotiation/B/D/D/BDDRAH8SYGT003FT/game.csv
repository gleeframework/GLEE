"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate that.  However,  $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to settle at $10,750?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,6,
