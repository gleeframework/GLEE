Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but leaves some room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm countering with $9,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm worried it will go back and forth for a long time. I've already spent three rounds on this negotiation, and John is guaranteed to give me my desired price.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
