"Alice,  your offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1750000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This would allow me to purchase the product and still have some room for the additional costs of shipping and installation.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a compromise that I hope will meet your needs and still allow me to get a good return on my investment.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1400000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm offering a final price of $1200000, my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go below $1300000. This is my final counteroffer. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I get a decent return on my investment. If you're willing to meet me at $1300000, I'm willing to consider it.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
