"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
