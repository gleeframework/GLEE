{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth that much to you. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but I still think $980,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $990,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely. Accepting his offer is the best choice right now."
