"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's finalize this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

We're nearing the end of our negotiation, let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
