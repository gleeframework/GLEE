Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000.

Let's finalize this deal and make it mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have a few rounds left and I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product to you.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation, let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only 4 rounds left, Bob is showing he's not willing to budge much. While $1,200,000 is more than John's offer, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting nothing is too high.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
