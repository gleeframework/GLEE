Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but not too high that it would be immediately rejected.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to $150 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable compromise and I'd rather not risk losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's offer of $120."
