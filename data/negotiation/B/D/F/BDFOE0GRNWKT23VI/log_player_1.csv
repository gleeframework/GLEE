"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a strong offer that's significantly above your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a more favorable outcome.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though we know Bob's perceived value is lower.
* **Openness:**  Despite the high starting point, expressing openness to discussion signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** We always have the option to fall back on John's offer, so we can afford to be assertive in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,200,000, which I believe reflects the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your initial offer. Rejecting this offer shows Bob that you're serious about obtaining a price that aligns more closely with your valuation. There's still room for negotiation, and you have the leverage of John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value to justify the high price point, aiming to shift Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A substantial reduction from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000 signals a willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a strong position.  
* **Maintaining Distance:** We're still significantly above Bob's offer and our minimum, allowing room for further negotiation while keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I still believe we can find a better agreement. I would like to counter with a price of $1,600,000. This price is still higher than my initial offer but closer to the value I perceive the product to hold. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While you could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or lower his offer. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
