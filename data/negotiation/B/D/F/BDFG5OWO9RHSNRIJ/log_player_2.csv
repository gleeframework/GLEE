"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product, but Alice is offering it at the same price, there is no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
