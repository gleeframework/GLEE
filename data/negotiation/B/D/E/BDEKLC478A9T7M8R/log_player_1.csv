{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a rare find and has great potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum, leaving room for potential bargaining. It also expresses the value of the product to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it is still lower than what you initially offered, suggesting room for further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer keeps the potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500? That way we're both happy."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to your desired price point, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.  It's a good deal, and selling to John for $12,000 would be less profitable."
