"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. By offering $8,500, he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also pushing for a price closer to her own value. This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it leaves room for some negotiation without risking losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is still below Bob's maximum price of $10,000 and is closer to Bob's previous offer of $8,500. While further negotiation could potentially get the price lower, the risk of losing the product to John at $10,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer at $9,200 guarantees Bob gets the product while saving $800 compared to buying from John."
