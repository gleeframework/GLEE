# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. While this is a good deal, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 92.50? It's a great compromise that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

You're still aiming to get the product for under $90. You can likely get Alice to come down a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we try 95? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. Let me know if it's a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down from her initial price of $100 to $95, and this is a good deal for you.  You are willing to pay up to $120, so getting it for $95 is a good deal.  If you continue to bargain, you may be able to get it for less, but you risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to take the offer and secure the product."
