I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get a price higher than John's offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I would be happy to get $10,500, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob $11,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to him. I believe this is a good balance between getting a better price and avoiding a protracted negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is close enough to my minimum price of $10,000 and represents a significant improvement from his previous offer. I am happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
