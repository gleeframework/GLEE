"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product, one that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but  $1,600,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,400,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a bit high. I can go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can close this gap soon.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here.  Let's bridge this gap quickly - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer in this range.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $1,250,000 is tempting. However, I have a firm budget for this purchase.  I can offer $1,050,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
