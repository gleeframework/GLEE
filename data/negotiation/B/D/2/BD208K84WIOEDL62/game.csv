"I appreciate your courtesy offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle a bit, how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're still a bit apart, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $14,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you can understand that I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
