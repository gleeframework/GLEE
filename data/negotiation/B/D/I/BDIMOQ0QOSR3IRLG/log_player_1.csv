"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation while signaling my value proposition.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The price allows for some wiggle room for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is about gauging Bob's interest and seeing how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending under $100. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $95 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is firm on his budget, he's expressed interest in the product. This indicates there's potential for a higher counteroffer.
* **Building Leverage:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates my commitment to my value and encourages him to increase his offer. 
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** Selling to John is a guaranteed $150, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but unfortunately $95 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $130 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $112.50? "", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message highlights the value of the product and my need for a reasonable profit. 
* **Specific Number:**  Instead of a vague ""closer,"" I provide a specific price point to make the negotiation concrete.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While offering a lower price, I haven't completely caved in, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. It's higher than my initial budget, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean selling at a loss.
* **Testing the Limits:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, which is a positive sign. It's worth exploring if he's willing to go higher.
* **Building Toward John's Deal:**  If I can't get closer to $150, selling to John is always a guaranteed option. However, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first. 
* **Signaling Commitment:** Rejecting his offer again demonstrates my commitment to earning a fair price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum while acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Small Concession:** The $5 decrease shows flexibility while not caving in completely.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""significant discount"" phrase subtly implies that this is close to my final offer. 

**Goal:**  At this point, I'm aiming to push Bob to either accept or come closer to my asking price, knowing that selling to John is always an option."
