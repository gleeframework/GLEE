Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $500000 is significantly lower than my initial expectations. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $1000000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
