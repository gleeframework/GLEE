"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit too low for you, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $97.50? That's the best I can do.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97.50, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100. How about $99? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value justifies the price.",99.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking to get closer to your original price, but I'm not comfortable going above $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $97.50 and $99. How about $98.25? That's the best I can do.",98.25,Bob,6,
