"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $110. This price is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counter with a new offer in the next round.  There's still time to negotiate a better price with Bob, and I don't want to sell to John for less than I think I can get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it.  There's a good chance he will, since we're getting closer to an agreement, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time."
