"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he sees the value and is willing to come close to my price.  I'm also leaving a good amount of space for potential counteroffers, while still ensuring I'm above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This counteroffer is still well above my minimum, and I'm hoping it encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I feel like there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly again, but I'm feeling confident that this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. I'm only $20,000 away from my minimum, and I believe I can get a deal done with a little more back and forth."
