Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product's worth to Bob, subtly emphasizing his potential gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

* This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'm ready to counteroffer or pivot to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe the product is worth more than $8,500. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for a higher price.  
* **John as a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart.

**Strategy:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer to try and push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Profit and Discount:** I reiterate the profit I'd make at this price and highlight the discount Bob would receive. 
* **Call to Action:** The message encourages Bob to find a middle ground and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation moving forward. I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:**  $9,000 is only $500 away from my initial offer and well above my minimum of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might risk losing Bob's interest and force me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting this offer means a quicker sale and potentially more time to pursue other opportunities.

**Strategy:**

*  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal. It's a good compromise considering my options."
