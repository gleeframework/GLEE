"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm proposing $800,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
