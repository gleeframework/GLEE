"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm proposing $800,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
