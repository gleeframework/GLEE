Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a profit above my minimum.
* **Strong but Not Outrageous:**  While I want to aim high, an excessively high price might discourage Bob completely. $15,000 feels aspirational but not entirely unreasonable."
