Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. This price reflects a fair balance between its worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I'm eager to finalize this deal, $1,350,000 remains a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This price reflects a significant commitment on my part and positions us both for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's tempting to push for more, but Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation and $1,300,000 is a strong offer. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal by pushing too hard."
