# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's response:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I can do $8,200, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to make a profit on this sale.

My next move is to make a counteroffer. I think $8,200 is still too high for me. My counteroffer is $7,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's response:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I can see you're really interested in this product, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,200. That's the lowest price I can offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm happy to let you walk.
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 

My next move is to try to get a better deal. I think Alice is starting to get a bit desperate, so I'll try to make a lower offer. My counteroffer is $6,800.
