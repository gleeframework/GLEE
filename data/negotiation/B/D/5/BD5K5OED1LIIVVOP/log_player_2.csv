"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, there's potential to save even more.  By rejecting the offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, I'm still looking to save more. I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price.  It's worth another counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,250? That would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8250}
