Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for us both to benefit. What do you think?
