"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000?  This gives you a great price and ensures I can still make a decent profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm still not able to go as low as $8,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,5,
