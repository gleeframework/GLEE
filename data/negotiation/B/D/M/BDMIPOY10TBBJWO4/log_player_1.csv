"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This will hopefully encourage Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to explore a range that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. However, I believe I can secure a better deal. Rejecting his offer will allow me to make a counteroffer in the next round and hopefully close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still significantly lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale.  This should encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's unlikely he'll offer much more. I've already rejected two of his offers, so accepting his counteroffer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
