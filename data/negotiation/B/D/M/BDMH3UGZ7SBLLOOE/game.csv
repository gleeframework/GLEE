,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's a significant step closer to your previous offer. Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and offer the product to you for $850,000, which is still a $25,000 discount from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $850,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $835,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",835000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go below $845,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $840,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product to you.",840000.0,Alice,7,
