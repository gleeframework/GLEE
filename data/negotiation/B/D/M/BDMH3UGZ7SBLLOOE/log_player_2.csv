```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. He's already had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers are still above his budget.  While Alice's current offer is getting closer, Bob is running out of time and the risk of further negotiation isn't worth the potential savings. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price."
