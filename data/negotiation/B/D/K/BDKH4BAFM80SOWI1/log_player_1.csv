"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with a higher price than you're willing to settle for. This gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Showing Value:** The message highlights the value of the product to you, subtly implying it's potentially worth more to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation going. 

**Remember:** This is just the first offer.  We'll adjust based on Bob's response and keep track of the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $16,000 is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($15,000), it's still below my initial asking price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000.
* **Time to Counter:**  I'm confident I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Round:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below $20,000 to show I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your price point, I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this unique product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $18,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and would give me the chance to get a good price for my product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial price, but not too much.
* **Highlight Value:** Again, I emphasize the uniqueness and value of the product, reminding Bob of its potential worth.
* **Staying Flexible:** This counteroffer opens the door for further discussion and potential agreement in the next round. 

**Remember:** I'm keeping an eye on the $15,000 minimum and the 10-round limit. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Bob's offer of $15,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I'm not willing to settle just yet. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price. There's only a $500 difference, and I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay a little more.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I have time to negotiate further with Bob, and I'd rather get a higher price if possible. 

**Next Round:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's $15,500 but still above my minimum price. I'll aim for something like $15,300 or $15,400."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $15,300.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it ensures I get a fair price for this unique product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer directly addresses Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's uniqueness to make it worth the slightly higher price.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're halfway through the negotiations, so I need to get closer to a deal. This offer might be the tipping point for Bob.

**Next Round:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If this offer fails, I'll need to decide whether to push for a higher price or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $15300 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $14,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Further Drops:**  There's a real risk that if I continue negotiating, Bob will keep lowering his offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing out completely. 

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $15,000 is the safest and most sensible option at this point.  I've successfully negotiated a fair price with John, and it's better to secure a deal than to risk losing out entirely."
