I'm starting with my target price, knowing I have John as a backup. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and then we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still significantly above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer is now at his maximum value, and it's getting close to my minimum. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000.  I'll accept this offer."
