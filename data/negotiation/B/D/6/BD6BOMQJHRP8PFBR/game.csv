,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little.  While I see the value in your product, $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal. Let's close this deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
