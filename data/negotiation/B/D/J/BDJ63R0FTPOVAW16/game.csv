"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's also a good deal for you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1600000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I can offer you $1550000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $1550000 is still a bit short of my target. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1625000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Let's close this deal. I can offer $1600000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. It's my final offer, let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1625000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this is the minimum price I can accept to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to hold firm on this price. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,7,
