"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I have 8 rounds left. I can try to negotiate with Bob to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John is a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can afford to be patient and try to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction, and it shows my commitment to making this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial price, but it's still above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** I highlight the price reduction as a sign of my commitment to the deal, hoping to persuade Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I keep the door open for further discussions, indicating that I'm flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,300,000 is still below my desired price.
* **Time to Push Back:**  I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a better deal. Rejecting his offer demonstrates this. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to get closer to my target price. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** Knowing John is waiting, I can afford to hold out for a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price I believe reflects the true value of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm framing this counteroffer as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only lowering my price by $50,000, demonstrating that I'm not willing to give away much more.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reaffirming the value of the product, making it clear that I'm not giving away the product for a price significantly below its worth.
* **Threat of Alternative:**  I'm subtly hinting that I have other options (John) if Bob doesn't accept this offer.
* **Negotiation Window:** I'm still open to negotiating, but I'm emphasizing that my offer is as far as I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Small Increments:**  Bob is only offering small increases, suggesting he's not willing to budge much further.
* **John is the Safe Bet:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, ensuring I won't lose out. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  It's more prudent to accept John's offer and guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
