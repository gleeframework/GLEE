Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  I could meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This would allow us both to reach a deal and ensure a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. It makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
