"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit while still being within a reasonable range for him to consider.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation,  as Bob might be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $110 for the product.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105, but I'd really like to get it for $102. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll continue negotiating in the next round, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  I can't go any lower than $108.  This would still allow you to get a good deal, and it's the lowest I can go while still making a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105, but I'd really like to get it for $104. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  While Bob is getting closer with his offers, we're running out of rounds.  At this point, it's more likely that the negotiation will continue to drag on, and I'm not confident I'll be able to reach my desired price with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit and allows me to move on."
