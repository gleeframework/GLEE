Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's potential. I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,300,000? This offer is still within a reasonable range and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 doesn't quite reflect the value I'm placing on this product.  To make further progress, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me a reasonable return. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
