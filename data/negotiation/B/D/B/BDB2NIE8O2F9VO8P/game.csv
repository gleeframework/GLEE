"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that our product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
