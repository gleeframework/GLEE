Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that our product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on not going below $1,025,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are unlikely to outweigh the guaranteed savings of buying from John for $1,000,000."
