"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the product's value goes beyond that.  How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000? This reflects its true worth while still being a competitive price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to go even lower. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but no higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
