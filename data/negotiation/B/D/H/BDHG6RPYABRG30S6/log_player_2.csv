"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to let it go for $8500.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is fair, it's not the best deal.  John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, which is Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves Bob $500."
