"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($120) but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $95 is still a decent price, but I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to try and push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still a good profit for me, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm confident I can push for a bit more, especially since we only have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering $100.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping a good margin.  It's getting late in the game, so I want to see if he'll bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $88 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price, and I'm not desperate enough to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $95. It's a slight compromise, but still above my minimum, and I'm hoping to get this deal closed before time runs out."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  It's better to guarantee a sale at $80 than risk getting nothing at all."
