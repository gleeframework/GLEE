"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $100 for it. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $150 is closer to my budget, I still can't go above $100. Would you be able to meet me at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $100 offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to my minimum price, so it's more profitable to take John's guaranteed $120."
