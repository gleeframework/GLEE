"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1100000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $850000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $975000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975000, but I'm still constrained by my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I truly value this product and believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to increase your offer, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,5,
