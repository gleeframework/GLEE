"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $975000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to increase your offer, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll reach a price you're comfortable with. 

Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, it's the most logical decision to buy from John and secure the product within your budget."
