Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is significantly lower than the value this product provides. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm worried that he's not willing to budge much further.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John and move on."
