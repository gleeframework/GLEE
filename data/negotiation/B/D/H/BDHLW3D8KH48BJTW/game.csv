"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,175,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll receive while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is significantly lower than the value this product provides. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's close this deal!",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
