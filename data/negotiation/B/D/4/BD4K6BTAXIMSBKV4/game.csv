"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussions to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd be happy to buy the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and I believe it still leaves room for a good deal for you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value I have in mind. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it leaves a healthy profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value I have in mind, but it's a compromise to show my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
