Please let me know if this offer suits your budget, or if you have any counteroffer suggestions.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
