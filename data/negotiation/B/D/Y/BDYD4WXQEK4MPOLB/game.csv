"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product will bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $900,000 falls significantly short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This reflects my commitment to finding common ground while ensuring the product's true value is recognized.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement. While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $980,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $970,000. I believe this is the maximum I can pay and still make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",970000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a way to close this deal.  If you're willing to meet me at $975,000, we have an agreement. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,7,
