"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer at $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counteroffer at $16500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll counteroffer at $17000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sticking with my previous offer of $16500. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",16500.0,Bob,6,
