"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both see in this opportunity.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a little out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair value for both of us. Let's reach a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
