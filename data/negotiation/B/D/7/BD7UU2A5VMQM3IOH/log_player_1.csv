I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good deal.  I'll be watching closely for Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $13,500.  This shows I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm still holding firm on my desire for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what John would pay. I'm willing to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
