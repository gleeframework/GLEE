"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

Bob should start by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer. This will give him some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price. Offering $10,000 is a good starting point as it is considerably lower than his maximum budget of $12,000 and might prompt Alice to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  He has room to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his $12,000 target.  He should continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

Bob should offer $13,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to negotiate but still staying within his budget. This should encourage Alice to consider making further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. He has some room to bargain before reaching his maximum price, and it's worth seeing if he can get closer to $12,000 before needing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his budget, but still wants to try and get a better deal. He should offer $14,000, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but still wants a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $14,500 is still slightly above Bob's desired price, it's very close to his maximum budget, and there's a good chance that further negotiation will not lead to a lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point, as it saves him some money compared to buying from John and avoids further negotiation rounds."
