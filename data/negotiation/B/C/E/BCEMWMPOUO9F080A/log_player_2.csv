"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is significantly below its true worth. Let me know what you think!
