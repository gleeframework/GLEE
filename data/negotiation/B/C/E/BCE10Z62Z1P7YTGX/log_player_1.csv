"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'm hoping Bob will come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, so how about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target price.  With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating with Bob. John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
