"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I would prefer to sell for more,  it's a good deal considering my minimum value for the product is $12,000.  Selling to John would result in the same amount, but there's no guarantee that I can sell to him in future rounds."
