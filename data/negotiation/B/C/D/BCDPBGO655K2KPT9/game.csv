"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as low as $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $97.50? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $96.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can do $98, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to make a profit on this sale.",98.0,Alice,7,
