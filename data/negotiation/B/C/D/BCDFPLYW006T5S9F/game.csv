"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I hope you'll consider this revised offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would that price point be workable?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your persistence.  To be completely transparent, I can get the product for $8,000 from another seller. To make it worth my while, I'd need you to come down to $7,500. That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you've got other options, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500, which is $8,000. This is still a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need you to meet me at $8,000. That's my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,7,
