Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm getting closer to being ready to commit. Would you be willing to come down just a bit more, say to $8,000 even? That would make the decision much easier for me."", ""product_price"": 8000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $8,000. I'd like to make one more concession. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $8,100. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is signaling this is the lowest she's willing to go.  Continuing to push could backfire and she might hold firm. Getting the product for $8,100 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000 price."
