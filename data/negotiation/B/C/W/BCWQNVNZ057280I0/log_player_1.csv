Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
