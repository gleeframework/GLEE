"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
