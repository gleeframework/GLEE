"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a bit more flexibility. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is my absolute lowest price. I'm confident that this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000, Alice, but I'm still not sure if I want to pay that much. I'm willing to offer $980000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made it clear that $1000000 is my absolute lowest price. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm starting to think that we're not going to come to an agreement, and I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll meet you at $995000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",995000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $995000. I'm willing to offer $990000 for the product. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000. Please let me know your decision.",990000.0,Bob,10,
