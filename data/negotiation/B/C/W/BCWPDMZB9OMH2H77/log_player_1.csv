{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer and I think it's fair to both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's still below my ideal price, it's very close and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future who will be willing to pay closer to my target price."
