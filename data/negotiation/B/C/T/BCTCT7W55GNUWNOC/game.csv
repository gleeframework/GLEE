"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  How about we start the conversation at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're on a budget, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $7,500?  That would really help me out.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $7,500.  Would you consider $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. How about we split the difference and make it $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,6,
