"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but I can't justify spending more than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? This product offers significant value that justifies the price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not able to go that high.  While I see the value of the product, $18,000 is pushing my limits. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's try to find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but $14,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair compromise considering both of our positions. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're very close to a deal!  I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,7,
