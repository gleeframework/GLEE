,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I believe would benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $12,000? That's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. $14,000 is my final offer - I think that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I have a strict budget, and $14,000 is still pushing it.  My best offer is $12,500. If you can't do that, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
