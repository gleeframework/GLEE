Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and positions the price as a fair deal.
* **Secure the Sale:** While aiming high, the offer is still significantly more attractive than Bob's alternative (not getting the product). This makes it more likely he'll accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay beyond the $1,200,000 valuation.
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the backup offer from John guarantees Alice at least her minimum acceptable price."
