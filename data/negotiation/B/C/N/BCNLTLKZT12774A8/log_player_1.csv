Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,075,000? This represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth."" , ""product_price"": 1075000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering both our positions. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting even less."
