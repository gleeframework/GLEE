"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing it from me for $1200000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at the same price. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open for potential negotiation or to explore other sellers."
