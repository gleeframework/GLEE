"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, it's still above his desired price range. There's room for negotiation, and he should try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $12,500? That's still a great price for you, and we can close this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. While $12,500 is better than the initial offer, it's still higher than his ideal price. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away."", ""product_price"": 12000}
