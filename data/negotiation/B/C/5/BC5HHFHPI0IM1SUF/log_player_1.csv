"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $11,500 is too low for me.  I think I can get a better price, and I'm not desperate enough to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $12,500? That's still a great price for you, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $12,000 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much more from him.  It's better to secure a sale than risk getting nothing at all."
