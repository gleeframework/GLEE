While I could hold out for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the money to invest or use elsewhere rather than risking further negotiation rounds.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his highest offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. 

While John offers my desired price, the certainty of Bob's offer and the potential downsides of continued negotiation make accepting the $1,000,000 a more strategic choice."
