"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good discount, Bob can likely do better. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further in subsequent rounds before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $700,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's serious intent to buy while also testing Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, it's risky. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and the risk of losing the deal to John increases with each round. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price, minimizing the potential loss."
