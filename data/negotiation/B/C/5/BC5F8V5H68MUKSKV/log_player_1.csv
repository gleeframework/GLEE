Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from selling to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that gives Bob a good deal (so he's incentivized to buy) but also maximizes your profit.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum value makes sense.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Profitable for You:** You secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Attractive to Bob:** He saves $50,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob tries to negotiate down, there's some space to meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  You could start higher and be willing to negotiate down.  Understanding your walkaway point (selling to John) gives you strength in the negotiation."
