Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand your position, I would like to stick to my initial assessment of the product's value. My counteroffer remains at $12,000. I hope this proposal is more aligned with what you're willing to consider.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is clearly fixated on $12,000 and unlikely to budge. It's not worth the time and effort to continue negotiating for a potentially small gain when I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John."
