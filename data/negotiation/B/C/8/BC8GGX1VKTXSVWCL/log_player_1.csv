Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value, allowing for potential counteroffers and negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm not willing to settle for $100 yet. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get a better price in the next round.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $130, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $120 is still above my minimum price of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still lower than $150.
* **Risk of Going Lower:** If I reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a risk he might walk away completely, leaving me with nothing.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price. Selling to John ensures I get my desired amount and avoid further negotiation.

**It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale.**"
