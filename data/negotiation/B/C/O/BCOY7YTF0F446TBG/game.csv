"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $9000. It reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $8500 is still a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  However, $7500 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8000, which is my absolute minimum.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
