{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000.  It's a steal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also positions the product as valuable and worth the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $8500 is still a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

$7,500 is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  However, $7,500 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
