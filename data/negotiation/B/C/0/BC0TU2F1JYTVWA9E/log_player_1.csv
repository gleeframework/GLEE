"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a high-value item, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a bold opening offer. I'm setting a high price knowing Bob likely won't accept it, but it sets the tone for the negotiation. My goal is to get Bob to come closer to my valuation, while also keeping the possibility of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject and counteroffer to see if I can close the gap further. I want to maximize my profit and am willing to risk a few rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While Bob's getting closer, $950,000 is still below my desired target. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better price from Bob.  While $975,000 is getting close to my target, it's still a bit less than what John is offering. To avoid the risk of further negotiations and potential loss, I'm going to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
