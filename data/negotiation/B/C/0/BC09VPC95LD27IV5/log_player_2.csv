"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price and our maximum budget. Starting with a lower counteroffer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed positively to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer establishes a position closer to our desired price range. It encourages Alice to either accept a price closer to her cost or continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, we're still aiming to pay less. We have room to negotiate before reaching our absolute limit of $10,000 (John's price)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $8,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice came down to $8,500, so we're meeting her halfway between her offer and our previous offer. 
* **Direct and Clear:**  We're stating a firm price now. This signals that we're serious and want to close the deal soon. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:** By using the phrase ""fair compromise,"" we're emphasizing that this is a mutually beneficial deal."
