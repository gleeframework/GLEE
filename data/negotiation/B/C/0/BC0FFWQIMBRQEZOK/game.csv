"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
