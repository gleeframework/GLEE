"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and the potential to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal target while still leaving room for negotiation. A $200,000 drop from Alice's initial price is substantial, but I believe it's reasonable considering my willingness to buy from John for $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my offer, and $1,100,000 is a good price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and potentially ending up buying from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
