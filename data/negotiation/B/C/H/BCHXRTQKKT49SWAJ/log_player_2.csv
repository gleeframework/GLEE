"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. There's a chance you can get the product for a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
