Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that $2,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about my budget. My counteroffer is $1,500,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.
