"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1050000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1075000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target of $1050000. Can we meet at $1060000?",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1060000. I'm willing to meet you at $1055000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1055000.0,Alice,5,
