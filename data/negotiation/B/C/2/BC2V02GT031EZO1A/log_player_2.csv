"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product of exceptional value. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of the product.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Exploring options:**  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You have a safety net with John's offer, so you can afford to be a little more aggressive in your negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,400,000 is too high considering the product's value. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

* **Setting a clear expectation:**  The message directly states that this price is within Bob's budget, aiming to encourage Alice to consider it."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While closer to your desired price, $1,250,000 is still more than Alice's perceived value and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Test Alice's willingness:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is genuinely willing to meet you at a lower price. 
* **Negotiation room:** You still have a significant buffer between Alice's offer and John's price, giving you flexibility to push for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal efficiently."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget constraints.
