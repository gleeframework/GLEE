"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product of exceptional value. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,400,000 is too high considering the product's value. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal efficiently.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
