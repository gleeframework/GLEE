Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $815000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

```
