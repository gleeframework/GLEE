"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm really aiming for something closer to $780,000. Do you think we can make that work?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $780,000, which would be $815,000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my own interests.",815000.0,Alice,7,
