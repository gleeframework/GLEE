Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate down.  This leaves you with a buffer to still make a profit higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Greed:**  Don't get too greedy and start at $120. This leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob walk away."
