Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price below our minimum requirement.

This price still allows us to maintain our desired profit margin, while also being more accessible to your budget. I hope you find this proposal acceptable, and I look forward to your response.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your feedback, I propose a revised offer of $825,000 for our product. This price is higher than your last suggestion but still within our desired range. It allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product more accessible to your budget. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for, and I look forward to your response.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've reached a price that is within my acceptable range and a good deal lower than her initial offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result, and I risk pushing Alice away."
