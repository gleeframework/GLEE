Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,280,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,320,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1320000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below what the product is worth to me, and we're running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
