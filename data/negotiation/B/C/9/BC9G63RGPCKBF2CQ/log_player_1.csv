Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

However, I've already had an offer from another buyer, John, who is willing to pay the full $1,000,000. I'm starting to get a little anxious about losing the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,005,000. This is my final offer, and I'm counting on you to make a decision."", ""product_price"": 1005000}"
