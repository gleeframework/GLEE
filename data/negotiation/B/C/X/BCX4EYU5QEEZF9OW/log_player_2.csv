"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible and you are willing to pay a maximum of $150, it's best to buy from John immediately. There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice as you've already reached your price limit."
