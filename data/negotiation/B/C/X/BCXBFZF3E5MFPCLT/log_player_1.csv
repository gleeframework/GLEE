Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $15,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's room to potentially earn more.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling on a price higher than $12,000 (his perceived value).
* **Respecting Bob's Time:** Offering a price too close to $15,000 might be seen as unreasonable and discourage Bob from engaging in negotiations. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
