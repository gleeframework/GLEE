Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $12,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting closer, $9,750 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal with Bob.  If it fails, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $9,750 just isn't quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $10,125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very fair, and I respect that.  Let's settle this right now. How about $9,900?  That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to close the deal with Bob, $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is offering me $10,000, which is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirements.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
