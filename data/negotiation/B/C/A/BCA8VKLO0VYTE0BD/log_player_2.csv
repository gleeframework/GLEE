"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $12,000 to you at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $10,000 right away.  Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to come down a little?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider a price of $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $9,500.
* **John's Offer:** John is selling the same product for $12,000.

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's offer and still within Bob's budget, accepting is the best choice. It saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John."
