"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's start with $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also being within your budget. ",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $850,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up from your previous offer. However, $850,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  I'll offer you the product for $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will work for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I see that you're serious about acquiring this product, and I value your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise between our last offers.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",850000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",800000.0,Bob,8,
