Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice is in a strong position. She knows he values the product at $10,000 and has a guaranteed sale to John at that price."
