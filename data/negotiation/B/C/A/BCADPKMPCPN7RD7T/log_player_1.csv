"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for further negotiation. I'm also emphasizing fairness to keep the conversation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I think $92 is a more reasonable price for me. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum, Bob's offer of $92 is now only $8 less than my minimum and there's a chance he'll refuse to go higher. Selling to John for $100 would be ideal, but I risk losing the deal altogether if Bob rejects my next offer. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation."
