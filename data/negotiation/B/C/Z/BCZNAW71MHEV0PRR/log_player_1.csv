"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your target. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down later.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's above his perceived value, it sets a reference point that might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and negotiating style.  His response will give you valuable information for your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price. How about we start around $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, it's worth continuing negotiations with Bob for a few more rounds to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher price. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** Bob's offer was very low. Coming down by $200,000 shows flexibility but keeps the price well above his initial offer, aiming to bring him closer to your desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's inherent worth, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'd be getting.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** The offer, while a significant decrease, is still high enough to prompt a counteroffer from Bob if he's genuinely interested, allowing you to gauge his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me.  I'm serious about buying, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $700,000 is still significantly less than John's offer and below Bob's own perceived value of the product. Let's keep negotiating and see if we can get closer to at least $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your willingness to engage in this negotiation."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer represents a significant concession from your previous price while still staying comfortably above Bob's offers. It's a classic negotiation tactic designed to signal fairness and encourage agreement.
* **Emphasize Win-Win:** Framing the offer as a compromise reinforces the idea that both parties are getting something they want, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, offering a seemingly fair deal could nudge Bob to accept sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both want to find a solution here. Your willingness to meet in the middle is good, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I'm confident this product is worth it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards his perceived value, but we're still not there.  We're getting close enough to John's offer that it's worth pushing a bit more to see if Bob will budge closer to $800,000.  There's still a chance to get a better deal than selling to John outright."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget considerations.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer splits the difference between the last two offers, demonstrating a spirit of compromise while setting a clear bottom line. 
* **Final Offer:** Stating this is your final offer introduces a sense of urgency. It also signals to Bob that you're serious about closing the deal now and won't keep negotiating indefinitely. 
* **Above Bob's Offer, Below John's:** The offer is still more attractive than selling to John outright while encouraging Bob to accept before you potentially walk away from the negotiation."
