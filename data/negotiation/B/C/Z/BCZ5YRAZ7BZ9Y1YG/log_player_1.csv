Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies it's worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and inquiring (""What do you think?""), suggesting you're open to discussing the price further. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed offer. If Bob knows about John, your negotiating position weakens.
* You'll need to be prepared to potentially lower your price if Bob pushes back, but always aim to stay above your $15,000 minimum."
