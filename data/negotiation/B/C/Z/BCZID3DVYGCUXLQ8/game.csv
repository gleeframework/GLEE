"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $10,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's keep this deal going!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can you consider this offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  I'm still a bit away from my ideal price, but I'm willing to budge a little further. How about $10,400? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm also trying to get the best value for my product.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,350? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,350 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,300 and $10,350, which would be $10,325. Can you consider this offer?",10325.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might be at an impasse. I'm willing to do one last compromise to avoid going to another buyer. How about $10,375? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",10375.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a last compromise, but $10,375 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,325, but no higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",10325.0,Bob,10,
