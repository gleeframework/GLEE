"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum budget, there's significant room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to set a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It demonstrates your serious interest in purchasing the product while pushing for a price closer to your ideal range. The message also maintains a friendly and open tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This offer represents a significant discount and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's a decrease from her initial offer, it's still outside of the range that makes sense for me. I want to continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise given the value we both see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a gradual increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price below Alice's latest offer. This strategy aims to show that I'm serious about the purchase while pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. Let's split the difference - $1,125,000 and we have a deal. I need to know your final answer soon as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is close enough to my desired price range that it's worth accepting. The added pressure of another buyer makes it a good time to finalize the deal.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'd be stuck with the higher price from John."
