"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer will allow Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make the sale happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even at $9,000, he can still save money by negotiating further. It is more beneficial to try to get a lower price than to accept a price that is still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I can offer you a slight discount to $9,200, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make it happen.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Even though it's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $10,000.  Alice has indicated this is her lowest price, so further negotiation is unlikely to yield better results.  Bob is saving $800 compared to John's offer."
