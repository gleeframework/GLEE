"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a good deal.  I'm also keeping in mind the 10 round limit, so I need to be aggressive but not overly so."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give away the product for less than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price, so I'm going to accept it.  It's not the ideal price, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount and having to deal with the additional rounds of negotiation."
