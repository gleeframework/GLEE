The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is $150. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $150 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still aiming for a price closer to $120. While $140 is better than $150, it's still not the best deal for you. Keep negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $135? It's closer to my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $137.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $137.50 is tempting, you're still trying to save as much as possible. You can likely get a better deal if you continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with each offer. However, $137.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $133. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 133}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $133. How about we meet at $135.25? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've been negotiating for a while and are getting closer to a price that works for you, but you're running out of time. The clock is ticking and you only have 3 rounds left. If you continue negotiating, you risk Alice getting stubborn and refusing to budge, and you may not be able to get the product for a price you're happy with.  Buying from John for $120 guarantees you the product at your target price. It's a safer bet to ensure you get the product for the price you want within the limited timeframe."
