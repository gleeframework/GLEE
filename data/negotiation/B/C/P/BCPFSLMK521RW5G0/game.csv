"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $150 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $135? It's closer to my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $137.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
