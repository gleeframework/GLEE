Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget.  It's too early in the negotiation to give in, and I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'll start by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000.
