"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what I believe this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
