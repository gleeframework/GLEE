"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $13,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $13,800, but I don't think I can go lower than that. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $13,500. This seems to be a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and we're already on round 4. It's risky to keep negotiating, as I might not be able to get a better price and risk selling to John for a lower amount. So, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $13,500."
