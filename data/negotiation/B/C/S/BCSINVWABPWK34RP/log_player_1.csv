Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit for you.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000. This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's higher valuation while having a safety net."
