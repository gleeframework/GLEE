"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob. I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I'm willing to let you have it for $9000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $10000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $10,000. Even though the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he can save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
