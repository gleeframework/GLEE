"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the substantial value of the product and is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
