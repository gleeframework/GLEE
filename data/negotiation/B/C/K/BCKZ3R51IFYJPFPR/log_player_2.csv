Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,750,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,600,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can potentially get it for less from Alice or buy it from John for $1,500,000.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
