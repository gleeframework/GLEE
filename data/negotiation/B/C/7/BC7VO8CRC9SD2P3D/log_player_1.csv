{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable price ($120) to maximize potential profit.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, subtly suggesting that $110 is a good deal for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate, which is important for a successful transaction.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $90 is significantly less than my minimum of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **I have a better alternative:** I can sell the product to John for $120, guaranteeing me a profit.
* **Negotiation space:** While Bob is interested, his offer is too low, and I still have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While $90 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my acceptable range:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like we're both working towards a compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying the price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a favorable price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price if the negotiation drags on.
* **No need to risk further counteroffers:**  While Bob seems interested, his offers are consistently below my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will choose to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","You're right! I missed that I was supposed to be Alice.  As Alice, I would be making the counteroffer in this round. 

Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still a bit lower than I can go. How about we split the difference at $97.50? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 97.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my acceptable range:** $97.50 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $95, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Splitting the difference:** This shows willingness to compromise and makes Bob feel like we're both working towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Reiterating value:**  While I'm coming down in price, I'm still reminding Bob of the value of the product, justifying the price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
