"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While $90 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still a bit lower than I can go. How about we split the difference at $97.50? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",97.5,Alice,5,
