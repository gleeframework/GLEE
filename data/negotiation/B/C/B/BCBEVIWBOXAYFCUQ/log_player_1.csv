Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a good deal for both of us: I'll get more than my minimum price, and Bob has the potential to get a valuable product at a potentially lower price than he would elsewhere.  

If he rejects, I know I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not taking any real risk by offering a higher price."
