"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more budget-friendly. How about we bring the price down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the price is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I'm willing to let it go for.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. To be frank, I've found similar products in the $700,000 range. If you're willing to come down to $725,000, I think we could close this deal today.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to meet me a little closer to my budget.  Would you consider $790,000? That's a fair offer, and it saves us both the time and effort of further negotiation.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to close the deal. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $790,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to wrap this up right now.  I'll offer you $805,000.  That's more than fair, and it allows us both to move on with our day.  What do you say?",805000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $805,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $830,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",830000.0,Alice,9,
