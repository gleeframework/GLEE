While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,775,000 is a strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Profitable Outcome:**  We are still securing a significant profit above our minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation has a cost. Accepting now ensures a faster deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Uncertainty of Future Offers:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and we risk leaving money on the table if we decline and he doesn't budge."
