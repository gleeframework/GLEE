{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

 ""product_price"": 100
}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as close to $100 as I can get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between $105 and a potentially lower offer isn't worth the risk of her backing out."
