"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further and exploring possibilities that work for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1,500,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident that this product's value exceeds that, especially for your specific needs. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the product's unique worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,400,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's on the table.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,325,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
