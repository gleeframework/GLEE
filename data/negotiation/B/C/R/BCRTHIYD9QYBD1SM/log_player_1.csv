Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is slightly above your minimum of $100, leaving room for negotiation. However, it's still below Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him incentive to accept the offer.  If he rejects, you can still sell to John for $100. This strategy maximizes your potential profit while ensuring a sale."
