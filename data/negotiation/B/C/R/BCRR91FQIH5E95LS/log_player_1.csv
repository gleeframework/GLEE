Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a significant price reduction for me, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $130, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to me, and I'm already at round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  Even though Bob's offer is only $130, it's still a decent profit.  It's unlikely I'll get a higher offer in the next few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
