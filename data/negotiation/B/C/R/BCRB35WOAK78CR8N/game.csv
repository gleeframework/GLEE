"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really looking to stay under $11,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay under $11,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see that we're getting close to the value you mentioned earlier, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
