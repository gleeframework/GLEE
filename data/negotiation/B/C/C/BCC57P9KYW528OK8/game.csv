"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm interested in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my means. Can we meet in the middle?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000? This considers both our positions while recognizing the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1,250,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the market. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer of $1,100,000, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true potential. Let's settle this right now - how about $1,175,000? It's a fair deal that avoids further back and forth.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
