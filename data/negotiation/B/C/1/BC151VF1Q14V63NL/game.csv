"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal, but I need to be careful with my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than my original offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price!",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $6500. I really like the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",6500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6500 is a serious offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $7200. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6500 and $7200, which would be $6850. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",6850.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6850 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer you the product for $7100. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $7100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer of $6500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15000.",6500.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one last offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $7000. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7000.0,Alice,11,
