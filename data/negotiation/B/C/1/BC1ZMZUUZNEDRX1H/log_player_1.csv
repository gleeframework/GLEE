Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

Here's why this offer is strategic:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($400,000) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is strong, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Considering the Alternative:**  You know you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, but maximizing profit with Bob is the primary goal."
