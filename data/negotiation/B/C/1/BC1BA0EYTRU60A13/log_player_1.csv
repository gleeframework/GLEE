Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which reflects its quality and potential. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs while still allowing me to achieve a good outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $875,000 is closer to my goal, I still think I can squeeze out a bit more. We've already established that this product is worth more to Bob than his current offer.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a middle ground here.  Your offer of $875,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's close this deal and get you the product you need."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $880,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer. We are only a few rounds away from the deal expiring, and I don't want to risk losing a good buyer. Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price from John."
