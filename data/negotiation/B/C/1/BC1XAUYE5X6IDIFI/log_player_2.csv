Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to pay $10,500, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility. There's still room for a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down to $10,800, which is lower than what he would pay John.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk Alice withdrawing her offer or Bob ending up paying John's price.  It's a good deal for Bob."
