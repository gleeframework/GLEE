"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for a one-time price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not even close to a reasonable deal. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is also a bit low considering the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm willing to make a deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, which is $10,500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my preferred price, $10,500 is still above my maximum budget. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get it down to $9,000 or lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,500 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a compromise on my end.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which is $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. Even though we've made progress, I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000 for this product. I'm confident that I can get the product from John for my desired price, so I'm going to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
