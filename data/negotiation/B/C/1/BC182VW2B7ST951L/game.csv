"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for a one-time price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer of $18,000 is way out of my range.  I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is also a bit low considering the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm willing to make a deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, which is $10,500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,500 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a compromise on my end.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which is $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
