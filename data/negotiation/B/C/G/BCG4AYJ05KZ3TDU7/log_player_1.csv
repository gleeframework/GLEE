Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm not setting a hard limit on the price.  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, and for me to accept a lower price if necessary. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is too low:**  While Bob's offer is better than his initial assessment of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has expressed interest in the product and I can likely get a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a little too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and makes it likely he'll accept.
* **Fairness:**  I'm using language that emphasizes fairness to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging.
* **Leaving Room:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I have some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to do $100?  That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum of $150, but it's still not a price that I'm comfortable with. 
* **Risk of going lower:** If I reject his offer and counteroffer again, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with nothing.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $150, which is a much safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of losing a sale and getting nothing is too high at this point.  It's better to take the secure option and sell to John."
