# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what you'd pay elsewhere. I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
