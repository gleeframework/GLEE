"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $12500 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13500.

"I understand that you've made significant concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've decided to make one final counteroffer of $12000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from you. If not, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $8000.",12000.0,Bob,10,
