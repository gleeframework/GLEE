"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, to be fair to both of us, I can't accept a price that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal.  While I've come down in price, your offers haven't moved much. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $800,000.  My best and final offer is $875,000. This gives you a significant discount and keeps it worthwhile for me.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable paying $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price you mentioned your other buyer is willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
