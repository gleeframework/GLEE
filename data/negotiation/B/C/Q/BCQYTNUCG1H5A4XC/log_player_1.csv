"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it to you for $950,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price (""true value,"" ""benefits"") helps anchor the negotiation and makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not ridiculously high, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial portion of my potential profit.  I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to my starting point in Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, to be fair to both of us, I can't accept a price that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($850,000) and my previous ask ($950,000). It shows I'm willing to move but also that I'm serious about securing a price that reflects the product's worth.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can be effective as it suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While lower than my initial offer, $900,000 still leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but it's also a price point I'm comfortable accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting too close to John's standing offer. While I want to maximize profit, I need to recognize when Bob is unlikely to move much further. The risk of him walking away is now too high. Rejecting this offer shows firmness, but I need to be prepared to either accept a price very close to this or take John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal.  While I've come down in price, your offers haven't moved much. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $800,000.  My best and final offer is $875,000. This gives you a significant discount and keeps it worthwhile for me."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness and Transparency:** This counteroffer makes it clear this is my final position.  Mentioning John's offer, without going into too much detail, adds pressure and emphasizes that I'm willing to walk away.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the discount and appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal aims to make this offer more appealing.
* **Finality:** By stating this as ""best and final,"" I'm setting a clear boundary for Bob. He now needs to decide if the deal is worth it, or risk losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable paying $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price you mentioned your other buyer is willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge past my alternative offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation. It's clear Bob is trying to lowball me, knowing I have another buyer at $800,000.  Selling to John guarantees the price I need and avoids further wasted time and effort with Bob."
