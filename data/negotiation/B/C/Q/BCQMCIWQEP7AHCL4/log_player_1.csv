{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $88. This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to stick to my previous offer of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is insistent on $80, and I'm not willing to go that low.  While I could continue to negotiate, it seems like this will go back and forth for a while. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John now for $80."
