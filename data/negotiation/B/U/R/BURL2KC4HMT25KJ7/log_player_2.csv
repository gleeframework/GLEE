"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a no-brainer. The product is worth no more than $100 to you, and Alice's starting offer is $130. You should definitely reject and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $85?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer and even less than our maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The tone remains positive and suggests the offer is a significant discount, potentially enticing Alice to counter. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to our target price while still leaving room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still significantly more than our $100 limit and our target purchase price. There's room to negotiate further towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $90.  Would that work for you?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, signaling willingness to compromise.
* **Budget Justification:** By mentioning our budget, we anchor the negotiation around a specific number, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a gap between our offer and our maximum, allowing for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $105. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $105, which is still above our maximum budget of $100. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and we have a guaranteed option with John at our target price. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
