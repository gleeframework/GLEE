"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to give up on a higher price just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects its value to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
