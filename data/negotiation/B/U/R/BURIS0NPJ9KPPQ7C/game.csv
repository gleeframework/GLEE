"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it's worth at least $100 to me. I'm open to negotiation, so I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $135?  That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
