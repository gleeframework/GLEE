"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $875,000.  While continuing to negotiate *might* get you a slightly better price from Alice, it's not worth the risk of her pulling out of the deal entirely. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is a significant saving compared to Alice's latest offer."
