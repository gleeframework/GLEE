{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, aiming for a good compromise.  I'm hopeful Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter his offer if necessary.  The option to sell to John for $10,000 acts as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's room for a better deal, so I'll reject his counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  Could we maybe settle at $10,750? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $250 less than my last counteroffer.  At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer. It's a better price than I could get from John, and it's not too far off from my desired price."
