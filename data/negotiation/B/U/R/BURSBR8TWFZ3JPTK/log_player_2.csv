"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show interest:** Maintaining a positive tone is important in negotiations. 
* **Anchor a lower price:** By starting lower than Alice's offer but higher than her value, we aim to create room for bargaining. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** We don't want to go too low immediately and risk offending Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we're still potentially leaving money on the table. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get even closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  Could we maybe settle at $10,750? I feel that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **We're splitting the difference again:** This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **We're staying firm but polite:**  We're holding our ground near our desired price without being aggressive.
* **We're leaving Alice room to counter:**  There's a chance she might accept, or we might have one more round to reach an agreement."
