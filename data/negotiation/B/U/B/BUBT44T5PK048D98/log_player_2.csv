"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price. You have a clear target price of $800,000 and this offer is significantly above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $850000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $950,000 is closer to your target, it's still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. Keep negotiating and see if Alice will come down further. You have time and John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. $900000 is a good offer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'd need $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and my own needs.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to your target, but $925,000 is still a bit higher. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $912,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can close this today."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $912500 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be at $920000.  This is a very small difference from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is tempting, you still have a few rounds and a backup option with John. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice closer to your target.  One more counteroffer could seal the deal for a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
