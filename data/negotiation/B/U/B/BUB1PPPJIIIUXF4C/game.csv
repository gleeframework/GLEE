"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is still a fair price and gives us both room to negotiate further.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. Let's try $1050000.  This price reflects the value of the product, and it leaves room for us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit steep. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,6,
