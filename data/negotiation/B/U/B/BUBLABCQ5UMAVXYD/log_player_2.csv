"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range for negotiation. This leaves room to meet in the middle while aiming for a price well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a price we like, $125 is still above our target. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer!  This counteroffer is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between her previous offer and our last one. It keeps us well below our $150 limit and is a good price for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can do $112, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$112 is a good price, saving us $38 off John's offer and a decent amount off Alice's initial price.  It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
