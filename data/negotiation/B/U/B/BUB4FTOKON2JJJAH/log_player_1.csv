"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to you. I've set the price at $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than mine ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value and the offer can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While aiming high, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me.  I would be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum ($1,000,000). While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:** I'm clearly rejecting Bob's low offer while emphasizing the product's value to justify my higher price.
* **Significant Drop:** I'm dropping the price by $100,000, a substantial amount designed to signal flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Framing the Value:** By focusing on the ""true worth"" and ""what you're gaining,"" I'm subtly shifting the conversation away from a simple price haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value is high, but I need to find a price that works for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Strong Position:** While I could try to push for a bit more, we are getting closer to the later rounds. Accepting now secures a good profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a higher payoff, but also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling. Accepting the current offer guarantees a significant profit."
