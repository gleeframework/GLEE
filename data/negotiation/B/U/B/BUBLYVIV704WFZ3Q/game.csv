"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $825,000. This price still allows you a good return on your investment.  Let's find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still below the value I need to achieve. I'm prepared to come down to $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This price allows you to secure the product at a fair value, while also meeting my needs. I believe this is a fair compromise.",800000.0,Alice,5,
