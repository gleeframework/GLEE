"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $82.50 is a decent compromise and I'm running out of time.  I'm confident I can make a good profit even at this price."
