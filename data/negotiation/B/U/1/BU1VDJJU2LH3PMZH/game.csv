"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1200000 is a significant amount, it's below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep the price below $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
