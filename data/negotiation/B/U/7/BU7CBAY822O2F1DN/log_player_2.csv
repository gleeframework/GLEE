{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's cheaper than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value ($8,000) as possible.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He should reject it and continue negotiating.  While the price is closer to his ideal, it's still higher than what he believes is a fair price. There's still room for Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but is also setting a limit on how much he's willing to pay.  $9,000 is a good compromise point, potentially appealing to Alice as it's closer to her previous offer, but still significantly lower than her most recent offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still higher than his ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's a risk. There's a good chance that further negotiation will either stall or lead to Alice rejecting his offer.  Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
