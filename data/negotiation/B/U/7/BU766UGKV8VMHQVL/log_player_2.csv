{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still trying to get the best possible price, and there's still room for negotiation.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so he can continue to try and lower the price.  By rejecting the offer, he can counteroffer again and potentially reach a price that's even lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,100? It's a small step closer to your last offer, and it's the most I can realistically pay right now.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. How about $9,150? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Reaching a compromise:** Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, and the difference is now only $50.
* **Time is running out:** Bob only has 3 rounds left. If he rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Value difference:** While $9,150 is more than Alice's minimum, it's still a significant saving for Bob compared to buying from John for $12,000.

It's a good compromise for both parties, and Bob gets a good deal."
