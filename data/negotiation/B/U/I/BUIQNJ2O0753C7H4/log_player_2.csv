"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's within your budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of the product. This indicates there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you ample time to try and lower the price.
* **John's offer is your fallback option.** You can always go to John if you don't reach a satisfactory deal with Alice.

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you are willing to negotiate and that you won't simply accept the first price she presents."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

* **Focus on a fair deal:** The phrase ""fair starting point""  positions this offer as a compromise, encouraging Alice to come down from her initial asking price.
