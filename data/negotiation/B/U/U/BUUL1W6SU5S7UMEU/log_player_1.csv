"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price well above my minimum.  This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, we can start working our way down, but I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiations become too tedious or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe I can get more.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.  I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John if negotiations stall or if I feel like Bob isn't serious about paying a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell.  Hopefully, this will lead to a mutually acceptable price in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Also, there's a risk that Bob will lose interest and walk away entirely.  Therefore, I'm going to accept his offer of $1,250,000. This ensures a profit and avoids further negotiations."
