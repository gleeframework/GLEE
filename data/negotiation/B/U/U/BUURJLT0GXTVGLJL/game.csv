"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems great, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This is my best offer, and it's still a good deal for you since it's more than half of what you're asking.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $22,000 is closer to the value this product provides. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects the true value and is a fair offer.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $19,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but we're just too far apart on price. I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher amount. To be fair to you, I'm willing to accept $16,500. This is my final offer.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
