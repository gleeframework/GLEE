"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm not sure I can justify $1500000 right now. I'd be willing to offer $1200000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I believe the potential returns will far outweigh the cost."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1250000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe the product is worth at least $1,300,000, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final compromise.  $1,300,000 is my absolute lowest price. This is a fair offer for both of us, and it allows me to move on with this transaction. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $1275000. This is a small adjustment, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,275,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  We're only a few rounds away from having to sell to John, so I need to be careful to avoid a worse outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to stay firm on $1,300,000.  With only a few rounds left, we're running out of time to come to an agreement.
