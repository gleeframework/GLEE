Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter-offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent profit, I'm not satisfied yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price is reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is above my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to $11,000 by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter his offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a bargain, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price is reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $9,000 is a decent profit, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter his offer again and try to close the deal at a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. My final offer is $9,750.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price is reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is too low.  I've already made a significant concession to meet him halfway, and there's not much more room for negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000 to avoid further haggling with Bob and secure a guaranteed profit."
