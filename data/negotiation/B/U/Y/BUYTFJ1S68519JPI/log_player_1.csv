Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) than your minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but you're still above your minimum. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup to ensure you get at least $10,000. 

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice has a high chance of securing a sale that nets her a significant profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
