Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,000 allows for some bargaining if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Provide Justification:** Mentioning the product's value subtly justifies the price without revealing your hand entirely.
* **Time Pressure:** Hinting at other potential buyers (listing it publicly) can encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
