"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $850,000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  This gives you a great price, and it allows me to still get a fair return.",825000.0,Alice,3,
