Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at John's price guarantees a sale, but I might be able to get more from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, but still ensures I make a profit above my minimum. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
