"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
