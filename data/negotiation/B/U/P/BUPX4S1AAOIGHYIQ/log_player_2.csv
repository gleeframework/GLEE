Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is close enough to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll walk away or that I'll end up paying more if I buy from John.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
