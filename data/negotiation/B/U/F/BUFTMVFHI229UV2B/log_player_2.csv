"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle on $11,250? This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price in subsequent rounds. He can also use this opportunity to explore whether Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875. This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $11,125. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,125 is now very close to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise.  Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
