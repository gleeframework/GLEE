"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great value for you. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? That's the highest I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to stay within your budget. If you're not able to accept this, then I'll have to move on to other interested buyers.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,290,000? That's my absolute limit.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,290,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not there yet.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1,295,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'll have to move on to my other buyer. Let me know your decision.",1295000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $1,290,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
