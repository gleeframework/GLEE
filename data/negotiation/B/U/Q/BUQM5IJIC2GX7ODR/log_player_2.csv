{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I am comfortable paying. While I could keep negotiating, it is getting very close to my budget. I've had 7 rounds of negotiation already and Alice seems firm. 

I'm going to take the safer option and buy from John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed deal within my budget, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely."
