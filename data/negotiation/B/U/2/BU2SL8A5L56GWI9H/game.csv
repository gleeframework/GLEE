"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering me this product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $80 for it. ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $85. Let's meet in the middle. ",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking $105 is a sweet spot, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
