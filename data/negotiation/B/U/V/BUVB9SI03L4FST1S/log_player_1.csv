Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher than Bob's perceived $10,000.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The $19,000 offer is significantly above your $15,000 minimum, maximizing potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""true worth,"" you subtly imply the product's value is higher than Bob's estimation, potentially swaying him. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower the price slightly, but aim to stay above your $15,000 threshold."
