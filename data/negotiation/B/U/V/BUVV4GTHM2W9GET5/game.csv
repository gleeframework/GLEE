"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest a bit less. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my absolute top end is $950,000. If you're willing to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your top end is $950,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $980,000? This is as close to your top end as I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Alice,5,
