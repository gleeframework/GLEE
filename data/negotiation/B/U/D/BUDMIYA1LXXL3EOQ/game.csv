"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $110 to be worth my while. Would you be willing to pay that?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Bob,4,
