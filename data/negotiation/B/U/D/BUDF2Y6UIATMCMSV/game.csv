"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Could you consider coming down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from what I had in mind. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
