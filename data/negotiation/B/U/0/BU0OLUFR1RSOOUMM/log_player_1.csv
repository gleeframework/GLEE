Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with my ideal price.  While I know it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately, it sets a strong starting point for negotiation and clearly communicates my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit while also acknowledging that Bob is a serious buyer willing to pay a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price and ensures a profit.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price,  the risk of further negotiation and the guaranteed profit with John makes accepting Bob's offer the best choice."
