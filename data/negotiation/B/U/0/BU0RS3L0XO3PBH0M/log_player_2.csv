"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,000,000, but it's still within your budget.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,350,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this price is fair given its value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I've given this a lot of thought, and to be completely transparent, the product's value to me is quite high. I could let it go for $1,275,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential.  Are you open to reconsidering? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and the price is now within a reasonable range for me. I'm willing to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation.  While I could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer again and I'll end up paying the higher price from John."
