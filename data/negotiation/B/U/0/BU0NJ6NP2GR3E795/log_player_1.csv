"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not outrageously high.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, as it's still higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.  I'm hoping this will entice him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm not in a rush to sell and would prefer to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit. I'm not ready to sell to John yet either. I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is still above my minimum and reflects my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's also a clear signal that I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm hoping this will push Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $140 is very close to my minimum and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher. It's better to close the deal now and secure the profit than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale altogether."
