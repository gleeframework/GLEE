I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but still allows for a significant profit for me. It's important to start high, but not so high that Bob immediately rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle immediately. I'll see if I can get him to raise his offer slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $17,500, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still hoping to get a price closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now too low, and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a guaranteed profit and avoiding further negotiation."
