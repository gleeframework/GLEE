"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price higher than the product's worth to me, but still within a range that Bob might consider reasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $150,000 difference leaves room for negotiation without forcing me to settle for a price I'm unhappy with. 
* **Optimistic but realistic:** I'm being optimistic about a good deal, but I'm also realistic about the possibility of needing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting, I can try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John right now would be safe, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my initial desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,250,000 is the lowest I can go.  This still allows you to make a great investment, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your purchase."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** This price still allows me to make a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's budget.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential return on investment, hoping to convince Bob it's worth a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. This still allows for a good investment opportunity while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future.
* **Securing the sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, even if it's not the ideal price.  
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm willing to take a small risk to potentially get a better price."
