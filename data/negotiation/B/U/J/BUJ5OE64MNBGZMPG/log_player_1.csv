Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $500,000?  That feels like a fairer starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
