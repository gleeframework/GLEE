"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $13,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,500.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

While $14,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $15,500?
