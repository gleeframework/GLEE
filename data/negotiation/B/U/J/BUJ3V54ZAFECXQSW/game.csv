"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,500.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $15,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",15500.0,Alice,5,
