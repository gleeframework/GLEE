"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this amount.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000, and it's closer to my minimum price of $1500000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above this amount.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
