{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than my minimum value, but I'm leaving room to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the potential value for Bob in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I've done some research and I think it's a bit overpriced at $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and it's worth seeing if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you've done some research, but I'm confident the product is worth more than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10250? This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000, but it's getting closer. It's worth considering accepting this offer because:

1. **It's close to my minimum:**  $10,250 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.
2. **Potential for counter-offers:** Even though it's his ""final offer"", there's a chance I can still push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round.
3. **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time and effort, and I might not get a better deal. 

While selling to John for $15,000 is ideal, accepting this offer from Bob is a good compromise that secures a sale without significant risk."
