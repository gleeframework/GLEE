"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I've done some research and I think it's a bit overpriced at $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you've done some research, but I'm confident the product is worth more than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10250? This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",10250.0,Bob,4,
