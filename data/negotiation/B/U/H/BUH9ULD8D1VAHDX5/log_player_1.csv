"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm going to start with a high offer, but still leave room for negotiation.  $1,400,000 is a significant amount of money, but it's still below what the product is worth to Bob.  This will hopefully encourage him to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 8 more rounds to get a better deal, and there's still a chance that Bob will be willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer will ensure a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
