Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.

Therefore, offering the product at $119 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" while maximizing your potential profit. If Bob accepts, you make $19 more than selling to John. If Bob rejects, you haven't lost anything."
