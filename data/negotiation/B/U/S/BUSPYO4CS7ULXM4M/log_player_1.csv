Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($100) and higher than what Bob values it at ($80). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the message positively to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Fairness justification:** I'm providing a reason for my price to make it seem more justifiable to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, so Bob doesn't feel like he has to accept or reject outright. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to my target price while still leaving open the possibility of a counteroffer and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While John offers a guaranteed $100, there's still potential for a better price from Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise and a great deal for you on a product you clearly value."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** My counteroffer of $95 is only $5 below my minimum price of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price close to my desired value.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and this is a good deal for him.
* **Compromise language:**  I'm using language like ""fair compromise"" to make it seem like I'm meeting him halfway.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, but I'm setting a clear lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, which would be $87.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed price from John:** John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is above my minimum and a safe bet.  

**Conclusion:** Given the risk of further negotiation and the guaranteed $100 from John, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John at this point."
