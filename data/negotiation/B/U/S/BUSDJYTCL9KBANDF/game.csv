"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a significant discount and allows us to both benefit from this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still firm on needing a price closer to $800,000.  I'm willing to drop to $775,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
