"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we settle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
