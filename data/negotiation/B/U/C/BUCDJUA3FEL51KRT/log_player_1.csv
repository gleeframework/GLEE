Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you to gain significant value.  I'm willing to start at a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low for me, given the product's value to me. I have 10 rounds to work with, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my desired price point, it's still quite far off. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have several rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $700,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000 as a compromise.  This is a significant concession from my initial position, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
