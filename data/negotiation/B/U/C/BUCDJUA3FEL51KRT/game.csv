"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you to gain significant value.  I'm willing to start at a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $700,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000 as a compromise.  This is a significant concession from my initial position, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal.",750000.0,Alice,5,
