**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice to get the price down further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I still need to make a profit, so my revised offer for the product is $1,120,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm running out of rounds.  At this point, the risk of not being able to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with is too high. I'm going to take the guaranteed deal with John."
