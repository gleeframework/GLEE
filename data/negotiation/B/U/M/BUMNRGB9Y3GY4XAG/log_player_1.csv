I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profits.  However, I am aware that I have a backup option with John, so I am not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell to John. I've reached a point where Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unattractive, and I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm happy to secure the $1,200,000 offer from John and avoid any further risk."
