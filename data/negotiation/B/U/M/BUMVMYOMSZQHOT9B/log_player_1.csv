{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  

Remember, we can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000, so we have some wiggle room!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm really interested in your product, though. How about $12000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at our minimum, we can likely do better.  We'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to our initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is our minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to make this work. How about $13,500?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. $13500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $12500. That's my absolute max, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to our ideal price.  $12,500 is a good compromise and we can still make a decent profit. It's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with John's lower offer."
