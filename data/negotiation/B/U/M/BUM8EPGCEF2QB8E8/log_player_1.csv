Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of securing a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" you subtly justify the high asking price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Gauging interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay and inform your negotiation strategy. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can always adjust your price closer to $800,000 if needed, but starting high maximizes your potential profit."
