"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the value this product brings.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $1,025,000 is still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $1,075,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced $1,075,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the price. How about we meet at $1,050,000, and I'll also get a 5% discount on the total price if I commit to buying the product within the next 6 months? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with the 5% discount. It's a significant amount, and it's hard to justify at this point. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, focusing on a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a discount, but 5% is a bit too high for me. Let's focus on the price first. I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's get this deal finalized."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,060,000, but I'm still not convinced it's the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, and I'll also throw in a condition that I'd like to have a 2-year warranty on the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a difficult situation. While $1,030,000 is not a bad price, the added warranty condition is a significant concession, potentially affecting my future income.  We're running out of rounds, and it's looking increasingly unlikely I'll get my desired price from Bob.  

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees me a good price and avoids the risk of a further price reduction with Bob."
