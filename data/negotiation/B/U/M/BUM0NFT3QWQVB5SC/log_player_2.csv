"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, there's room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it's meant to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially push her towards a more reasonable price.  I'm aiming for a price closer to half of what I'm willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial $5,000, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, so rejecting this offer and continuing to counteroffer gives me the chance to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to negotiate a fair price.  $3,500 is a compromise that is higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $4,500 is getting closer to my limit. While I could continue to try and negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that she'll continue to reject my offers, and I might end up having to buy from John for $10,000. It's getting late in the negotiation process, so accepting this offer is a good compromise. I'm saving $5,500 compared to buying from John."
