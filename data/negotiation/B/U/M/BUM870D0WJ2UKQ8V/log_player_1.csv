{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($120) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $119, there's a possibility Bob might counter-offer, giving you room to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price."
