# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss this further.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. I'm proposing a compromise: $1,150,000. This price is fair to both of us, and allows for a successful transaction. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $1,112,500.  This price is closer to my valuation and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,112,500

This is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, he risks Alice raising the price or the deal falling through entirely. It's better to secure the product at a price well below his maximum."
