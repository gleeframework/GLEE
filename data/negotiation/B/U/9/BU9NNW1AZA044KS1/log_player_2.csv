"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice, but if it doesn't work out, he has a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is fair considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still willing to pay $12,000, but $13,500 is still too high. He can always go with John, so there's no need to settle for a price he's not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. However, I can't go any lower than that.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is clearly not willing to come down to his desired price, and he's already wasted a few rounds. Buying from John guarantees him the product for his maximum budget."
