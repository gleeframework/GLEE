"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's not worth paying $180 when you can get it for $150 from John. Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $160? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is better than $180, it's still higher than what John is offering. Let's see if we can get Alice down to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice! $160 is closer but I'm still aiming for $150.  That's the best I can do. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $155? It's the lowest I'm comfortable going, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $155 is tempting, we're so close to our goal of $150.  One more counteroffer and we might be able to get there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still firm on $150.  That's my absolute limit, but if we can agree on that I'll buy it right now."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet in the middle at $152.50? It's the lowest I'm comfortable going, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to go any lower.  Even though we're close to our goal, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to start over with a new seller.  John is offering the product for our target price, so let's go with him."
