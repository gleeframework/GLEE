Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys it from you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and you don't know his exact maximum willingness to pay.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of Bob's potential profit as possible, but not so high that he'll walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message frames the product as valuable and your offer as an opportunity.
* **Strong Price:**  $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential $150,000 profit, a significant incentive to accept. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While you're aiming high, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. You can always decrease the price slightly (but not below your $1,000,000 minimum).

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he outright rejects it, you might need to come down a bit. If he counteroffers, you'll have more information to work with."
