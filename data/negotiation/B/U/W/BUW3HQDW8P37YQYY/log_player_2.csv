"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,999 is very close to her own valuation and significantly higher than your maximum of $10,000 and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can proceed to buy from John at a much lower price, saving you almost $5,000."
