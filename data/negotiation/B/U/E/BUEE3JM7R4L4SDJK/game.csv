"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? That's the absolute highest I can go right now.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we settle on $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference - how about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal. ",8500.0,Alice,5,
