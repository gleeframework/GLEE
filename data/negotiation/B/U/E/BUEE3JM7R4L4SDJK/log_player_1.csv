"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $9,000, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  It's important to show confidence in the value of the product and leave space for a compromise. I'm also trying to build rapport by addressing Bob directly and expressing confidence in his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? That's the absolute highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm confident that I can get a slightly better price.  I'm not willing to settle for $8,500 yet because I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we settle on $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm sticking to my initial goal of getting a price above $8,000, but I'm now offering a compromise to show flexibility. $8,750 is a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm highlighting the fairness of the price and trying to close the deal by reiterating my confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,250 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm not willing to settle for $8,250 yet because I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference - how about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a price above $8,000, but I'm now offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows that I am willing to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer and hoping to close the deal by reminding him that we can both be happy with the outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $8,000. How about we settle on $8,100?  This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go at this point. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, I'm aware that the negotiation is going down to the wire and I want to secure a sale.  $8,100 is above my minimum and will give me a small profit. I think it's in my best interest to close the deal now rather than risk a counteroffer or losing the sale altogether."
