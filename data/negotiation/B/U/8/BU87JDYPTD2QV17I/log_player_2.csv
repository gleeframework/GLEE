"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you today. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to give you a great deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and achieve a lower price. He has a few rounds left and can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,250 for the product. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is still to get the best deal possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  He has a few rounds left and can likely get a better price.  The longer Bob can hold out, the more likely Alice is to accept a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference again and go with $13,500?  I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a good chance that Alice will continue to hold out for a higher price, and Bob may not be able to get a better deal. To avoid potentially losing out on the product, Bob should choose to buy from John for $15,000.  It's not the ideal price, but it guarantees he gets the product within his budget."
