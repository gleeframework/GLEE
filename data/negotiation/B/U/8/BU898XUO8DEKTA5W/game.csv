"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit below my asking price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
