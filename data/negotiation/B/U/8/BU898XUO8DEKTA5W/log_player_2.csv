"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit below my asking price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,320,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While there is a chance that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, it's risky to continue.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has shown she's willing to compromise but only to a certain point.  It's likely that any further negotiations will be lengthy and may not result in a price that Bob is comfortable with.

Since John is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the most logical option to buy from John. This ensures that Bob gets the product at a price he can afford and avoids potentially wasting time and energy on further negotiation."
