"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I need to negotiate to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,600,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  While it's closer to my target, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $1,500,000 at this time.  This is my absolute top limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,500,000 is your absolute top limit, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's try $1,650,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  While it's closer to my target, I'm not willing to go any higher.  At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy the product from John, who is selling it for my maximum price of $1,500,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids any further negotiation."
