"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob ($8,000), there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer starts with a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. He aims for a price closer to his maximum value ($8,000) while demonstrating willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than Bob's preferred price point. While it's closer to his maximum value, there's still potential to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation process going and allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a smaller reduction from Alice's latest offer. This shows a genuine effort to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his target.  He emphasizes the benefit for both parties, making the offer more appealing."
