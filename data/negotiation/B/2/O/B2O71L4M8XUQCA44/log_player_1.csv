"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the value of this product.  While $1,150,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate.  $1,120,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  I think this represents a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While $1,080,000 is a decent offer, I believe Bob is willing to go higher. Rejecting now keeps the pressure on him and allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. How about we settle this right now at $1,100,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,100,000 represents a firm but fair compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's last offer and my previous price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is my final offer, I introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation further. 
* **Alternative Exists:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so accepting anything less than $1,100,000 at this stage wouldn't be the best outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you sticking with this negotiation. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe we're very close to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,090,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000) and only slightly below my target price in the previous round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for the last $10,000 has diminishing returns.  There's a risk Bob could walk away, leaving me to sell to John for a lower amount.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner, which always has value in business. 

Taking all factors into account, accepting Bob's offer at $1,090,000 is the most logical and profitable decision at this stage."
