"I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your position, $12,750 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,125?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13125.0,Alice,3,
