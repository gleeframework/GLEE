{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price that is a bit lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value for Bob:** $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $12,000 to him. 
* **Flexibility:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can always go with John for $15,000, so there's no risk of losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the conversation and propose a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. 
* **Sell to John:**  Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed alternative with John that offers a higher price, so there's no urgency to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your position, $12,750 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,125?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 13125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** The $13,125 figure is the midpoint between my initial offer ($13,500) and Bob's counteroffer ($12,750). 
* **Value for Bob:**  $13,125 is still a good deal for Bob because the product is worth $12,000 to him.  
* **Selling to John:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $15,000, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation:**  I've already offered a compromise, and Bob has not budged much. Continuing the negotiation may lead to further back and forth without a guaranteed outcome. 
* **Sell to John:**  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, there's no reason to risk further negotiation with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome."
