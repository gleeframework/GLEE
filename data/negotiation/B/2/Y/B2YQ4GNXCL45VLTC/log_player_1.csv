"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value. This should encourage Bob to accept while giving me a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $920,000 is still a good deal and is above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price in the future, but it's not worth risking the deal for a small increase.  It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the potential of losing the deal entirely."
