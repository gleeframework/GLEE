Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation without going over. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the fairness of the price, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
