"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, I'm not afraid to risk losing this deal.  Bob may counter, and we'll see where the negotiation goes from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept and get something, it's significantly below my minimum. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still aiming for a good profit and am confident I can get a better price than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  $175 is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and my ability to sell to John for $150. I believe this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  Although it's closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate for a sale. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I can still sell to John for a decent profit, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but I'm still holding firm on a profit.  Bob seems unwilling to budge much, so I'm showing I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a reasonable price. I believe $160 is a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not convinced.  I'm holding out for a bit more.  While I could sell to John for $150, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I think I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm making a final push to get a price close to my minimum.  $140 is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a good price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have the option to sell to John.  This is my final offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer, but I'm running out of rounds and I need to make a decision. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob.  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a better deal than taking the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
