{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer sets a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product is worth it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already given him a good discount. While I could continue negotiating,  it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my price.  It's better to sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
