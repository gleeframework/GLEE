"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget.  It's worth rejecting and counter-offering to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer than his maximum value, hoping to secure a good deal. He's also acknowledging Alice's offer and showing willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to compromise while still being a good price for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $9,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected a lower offer. Bob still has several rounds left to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive approach this round. He's raised his offer slightly, showing that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still well below Alice's latest offer. By suggesting they meet in the middle, he's trying to push Alice toward a compromise."
