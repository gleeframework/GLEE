Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,000,000.  Since you only have 10 rounds, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, it's worth trying to get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $910,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 910000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is just above your target price of $1,000,000. It's a good deal considering your limited rounds and the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price. It's unlikely you can negotiate much lower, and accepting this offer ensures you get the product without exceeding your budget."
