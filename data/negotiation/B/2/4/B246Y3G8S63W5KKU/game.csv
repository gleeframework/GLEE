"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a compromise. I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,380,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,380,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
