"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her counteroffer is still above your maximum price of $1,200,000. You've already made multiple counteroffers and it's clear that Alice won't budge further.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price point to avoid any further delays or potential for a less favorable outcome."
