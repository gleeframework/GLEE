"Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price that's significantly below its true value to me. I'm confident it's a great deal for you, and I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions or want to negotiate.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,750,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm still interested in finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer a price of $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  $1,325,000 is a good offer, but I'm only willing to go down to $1,340,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.  If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options.",1340000.0,Alice,7,
