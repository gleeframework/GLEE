"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
 ""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

This counteroffer provides a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still allows room for her to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  While $110 is better, you can still try to push for a slightly lower price before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $108?"",
 ""product_price"": 108
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice you are willing to compromise but also that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal."
