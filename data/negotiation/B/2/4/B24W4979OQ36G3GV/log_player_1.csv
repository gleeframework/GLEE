Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's not your absolute minimum, giving you space to lower the price if necessary.
* **Is attractive to Bob:**  It's significantly lower than the product's value to him, making it a good deal for him.
* **Is clear and concise:** It directly states the offer and leaves room for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $925,000? This would be a great deal for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $920,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $920,000 is a good compromise, and it's still significantly more than what I'd get from John.  It's important to close the deal and secure the sale."
