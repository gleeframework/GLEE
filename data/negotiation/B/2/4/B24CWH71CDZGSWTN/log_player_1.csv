Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer sets the initial negotiation point higher than Bob's value of $120, leaving room for potential compromise.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is above my minimum of $120, it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $115 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $125?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good value."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd be willing to meet you at $118. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $118 is still below my ideal price, it's just above my minimum and likely the best I can get from Bob.  It's not worth risking a further rejection and losing time in the negotiation, especially when I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120."
