Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to, increasing your potential profit.
* **Above Reserve Price:**  The $10,000 offer is significantly above your $8,000 reserve price (what John will pay), ensuring you make a good profit regardless."
