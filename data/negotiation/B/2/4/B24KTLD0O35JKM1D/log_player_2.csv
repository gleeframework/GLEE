"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation.  You'll likely get a better price from Alice with a counter-offer, or you can always go with John as a backup."
