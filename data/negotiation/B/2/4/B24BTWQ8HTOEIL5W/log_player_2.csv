"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. My starting price is $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Alice acknowledges this, so rejecting the offer allows me to try to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If I can't get a better deal from Alice, I have John as a backup, so there's no pressure to accept immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I can't go that low. How about $1,300,000? This price still allows for a substantial profit for you and gives us a good starting point for the remaining rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still above my comfortable price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's no need to accept her offer yet.
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** If we can't reach an agreement, I have a backup option.

By rejecting Alice's offer, I can continue to negotiate for a lower price, hopefully closer to my desired $1,200,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still not a price that works for me. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a decent profit. Let's close the deal in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high:**  While it's closer to my ideal price, $1,350,000 is still above my preferred $1,250,000.
* **There's still time to negotiate:** We're only halfway through the rounds. I have room to continue bargaining for a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't get a better price from Alice, I can still buy from John. This gives me leverage to push for a lower price.

By rejecting Alice's offer, I can continue negotiating with the goal of getting closer to my desired price of $1,250,000."
