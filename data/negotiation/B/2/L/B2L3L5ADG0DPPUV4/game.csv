"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about $1,050,000?  That would leave a good margin for you, and it's closer to my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I can appreciate you holding firm on the price, so let's make this simple. How about a final offer of $990,000?  If that works, we have a deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
