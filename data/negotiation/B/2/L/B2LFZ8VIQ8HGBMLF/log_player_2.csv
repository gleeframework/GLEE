"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price is fair considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting offer is above my maximum valuation. I should counteroffer with a price closer to my target, knowing I can always go up to $10,000 or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $9,500. This reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.

Alice is coming down, but I'm not in a rush. It's still better to try for a lower price before accepting her current offer or going with John."
