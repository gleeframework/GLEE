"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in further negotiations."
