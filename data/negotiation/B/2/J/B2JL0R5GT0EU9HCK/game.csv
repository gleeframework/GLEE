"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9200, and I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9200 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in closing this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
