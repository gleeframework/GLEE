"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is way above Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in buying it for $100, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $180 is my bottom line.  I'm confident you won't find a better product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is firm on her price of $180, which is still too high for Bob.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $100, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
