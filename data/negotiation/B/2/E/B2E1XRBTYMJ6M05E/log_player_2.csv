"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better price. It's always wise to negotiate, especially when you have a backup option (buying from John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Given the product's worth to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** You're still within your budget with Alice's offer, but there's a chance you can get closer to your ideal price of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that level."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you're already within your budget with John's offer.  It's risky to continue negotiating with Alice, as you might not get a better price and could risk losing the deal altogether. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
