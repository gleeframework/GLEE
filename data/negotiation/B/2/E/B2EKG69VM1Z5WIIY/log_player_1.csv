Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Starting at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to make the price more palatable. 
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act soon.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, allowing Bob to counter-offer and start a discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price he finds reasonable."
