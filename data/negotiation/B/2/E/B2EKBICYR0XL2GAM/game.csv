"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,150,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
