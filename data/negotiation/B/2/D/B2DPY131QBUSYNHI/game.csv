"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This reflects a fair price considering your value for it is $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $900,000. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This price takes into account the value you place on the product, while also being reasonable considering the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Given your valuation of $800,000 and my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This offers a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering your valuation of $1,500,000 and my original offer of $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our valuations and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  Considering our previous discussions and the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This reflects a fair compromise and brings us closer to an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still not a price that works for me.  We've both moved closer to a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. My final offer is $1,035,000. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1035000.0,Bob,8,
