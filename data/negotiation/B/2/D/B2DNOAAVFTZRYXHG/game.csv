,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $80 is quite low for this product. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $140 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I do want to try and make this work. However, I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
