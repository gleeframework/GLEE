``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product for me."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  

While I'm still hoping for a higher price, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further delays and a lower final price. With only three rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to reach a price that meets my minimum value. 

John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at a price that is acceptable to me.  It's a secure option that minimizes risk and ensures I don't lose out on a good deal."
