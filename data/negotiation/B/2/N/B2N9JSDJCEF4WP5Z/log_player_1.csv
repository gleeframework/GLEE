"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing its uniqueness. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit.  I'm aware that John will pay $1,000,000, so anything above that is a win. I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, even though it's a significant jump from his previous offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price, but I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential deal with John. I'm willing to accept a lower price if it means closing the deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is still above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000 and it shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm serious about closing the deal with Bob.
* **Message:** I'm remaining friendly and acknowledging Bob's increased offer, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product. I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a final decision.

**Strategy:**

By lowering my price, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's profitable for me.  I believe this counteroffer is fair and might tempt Bob into accepting.  However, I'm also prepared to lower my price further in subsequent rounds if necessary. I'll continue to monitor the remaining rounds and the option of selling to John, but I'm committed to closing a deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, making it a profitable deal for me.  While I initially aimed for a higher price, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiations with only 6 rounds remaining.  

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely.  It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal before the time runs out or I'm forced to accept John's offer.  This decision reflects a pragmatic approach to maximizing my earnings within the constraints of the negotiation."
