Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product!

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can buy the product for $11,000, which is less than what he would pay John. While he could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice will reject and he'll have to pay John's higher price."
