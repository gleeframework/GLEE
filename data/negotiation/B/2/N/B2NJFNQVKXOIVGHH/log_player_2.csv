"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can get a better deal from John."
