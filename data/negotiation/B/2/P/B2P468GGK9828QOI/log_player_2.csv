"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's still a bit high. You want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  Offering $85 is a significant discount from Alice's asking price, but still above her value of $80. This shows you're serious about buying but also aiming for a good deal. 
* **Positive message:** Using a friendly and positive message keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident this product is worth that to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your budget, you're still aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially bring the price down further. You have a few rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $88. I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  The counteroffer of $88 is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to negotiate but still focused on getting a good price.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Adding ""I'm ready to close the deal"" suggests you're close to making a decision, which might encourage Alice to consider your offer.
* **Focus on value:**  The message reminds Alice that you're still interested in the product, but at a price that works for you."
