Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go below $11,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,800?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but also showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway.  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go above $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $11,000, which is the same as her initial offer. This is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $12,000. It's a better deal than buying from John, and further negotiation might not yield significant savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
