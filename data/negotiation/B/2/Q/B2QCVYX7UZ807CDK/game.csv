"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle a bit? Would you consider $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a bit more than $6,500, but I'm still a bit shy of $8,750. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $7,500 is getting closer, but I need to be at least above $8,000 for this to work. Would you be willing to do $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,250, so how about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
