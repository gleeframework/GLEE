"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $800,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good starting point for further discussion.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'm counteroffering a price of $920,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement. ",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. But, $915,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and be done with it.",900000.0,Bob,8,
