"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum and what John offers. Rejecting this offer pushes Alice to potentially lower her price or lets you buy it for a better price from John."
