``` 

**Reasoning:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more significant discount. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), there is still a significant gap. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation to get a price closer to my desired value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is guaranteed, I am willing to risk another round of negotiation to potentially secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing discussions, $900,000 is unfortunately not a price that works for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm offering $1,050,000. This reflects the product's unique value and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but not willing to give away too much value.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price, emphasizing the ""mutually beneficial agreement"" aspect.
* **Openness:** I encourage further discussion by inviting Bob to work together to find a solution, signaling flexibility."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still a Gap:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still a significant gap between his offer ($950,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I'm confident that I can potentially get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **Time is on my Side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have enough time to see if Bob is willing to come up in his price. 

**Note:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a secure option, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially secure a higher price from Bob, especially since we're getting closer to a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While your offer is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need a bit more to make this work.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still looking for a bit more, Alice, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and I'm willing to make one final compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation window is closing quickly.
* **Significant Gap:**  Despite Bob's willingness to compromise, there is still a significant gap between his offer ($990,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high. With only two rounds left, it is unlikely that he will meet my minimum price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a secure and profitable outcome. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, the time constraint and the remaining price gap make selling to John the most logical and financially secure option at this point."
