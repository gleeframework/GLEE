"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $150. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference at $102.50? That's closer to your price but still saves me a little.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $102.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $102.50, which would be $106.25. What do you think?",106.25,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up slightly from my last offer. How about $104?",104.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $106.25 and $104, which would be $105.125. Let me know if that works for you.",105.125,Alice,9,
