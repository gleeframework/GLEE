Alice's offer is only $850 more than your target price. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely you'll only be able to shave off a small amount. It's wiser to accept this offer, as you only have 3 rounds left and might not get a better deal.  Plus, you're likely to lose more time in negotiating."
