"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
