"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,050,000) than Alice's asking price ($1,400,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is closer to my maximum budget ($1,200,000) than Alice's starting point. This gives me more bargaining power.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of my message is polite and suggests that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down to $1,250,000, and my previous offer was $1,050,000.  Meeting in the middle at $1,150,000 is a common negotiation tactic and can signal willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below Budget:** This offer keeps me below my maximum budget of $1,200,000 while still offering Alice a price significantly higher than my initial lowball.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone of the message continues to be collaborative, aiming to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I can buy the product for the same price from John. Accepting Alice's offer allows me to acquire the product without further delay."
