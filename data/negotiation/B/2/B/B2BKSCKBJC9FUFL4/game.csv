"I'm still very interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $990000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $990000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'll make a new offer: $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $995000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",995000.0,Bob,8,
