Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already met you at $950,000 and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a comprehensive support package and a 6-month warranty, which is a $50,000 value. That brings the total value to $1,000,000, which is the price I was initially looking for. Would you be interested in taking the product at $950,000 with these extras? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $950,000.  She's already stated this is her bottom line.
* **Value Add:** The extras she's thrown in do hold some value, even if it's difficult to quantify exactly.
* **Time:**  You're getting close to the end of your negotiation window. John is a guaranteed option, but there's no guarantee of finding a better deal elsewhere at this point. 

While you could try to push for the $925,000, the risk of Alice walking away and the added time pressure make accepting the $950,000 offer a smart move."
