Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than my minimum, it's still quite a bit lower than my ideal selling price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $140. This is still a good price for me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and is only $5 less than my last offer.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me much more, so I'll accept this offer."
