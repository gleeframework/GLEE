"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By anchoring the negotiation with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation while aiming for the best possible outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the value for Bob, subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open Communication:**  The tone is friendly and invites Bob's response, encouraging a collaborative negotiation.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum valuation, leaving no room for negotiation on his end. Accepting would mean selling significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is an option, I still have rounds to try and secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm confident this product can significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I can offer it for $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but not desperation. This maintains a price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Value Reiteration:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits, justifying a higher price point.
* **Compromise Language:** By framing the new price as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm nudging Bob towards accepting while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential value this product offers me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, demonstrating a genuine interest in reaching a deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a very good profit.

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer ($1,500,000) outweighs the potential reward."
