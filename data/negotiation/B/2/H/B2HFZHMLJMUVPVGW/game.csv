"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $1,200,000 for the item. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum threshold for selling. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my part, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
