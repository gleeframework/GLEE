Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Anchoring:** By initially offering a high price, you set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be favorable to you compared to starting low.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can always adjust the price closer to his perceived value ($10,000) if needed, while still aiming for a price higher than John's offer."
