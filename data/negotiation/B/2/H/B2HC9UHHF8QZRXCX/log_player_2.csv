"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a considerable amount. It's worth exploring if a better price can be negotiated with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to Alice's desired value. This shows he's serious about the purchase but is also willing to negotiate. A $100,000 difference from Alice's initial offer is a substantial amount, but still within Bob's budget. This approach allows for negotiation room in the subsequent rounds while keeping the possibility of a deal within reach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $1,100,000, it's still not ideal for Bob. He can still potentially negotiate a better deal by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. Bob has 7 rounds left, so there's time to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,075,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a lower price.  This is a moderate increase from his previous offer, signaling a desire to reach an agreement. This strategy aims to find a middle ground without pushing Alice away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still not ideal. He's still within his budget and has time on his side with 5 rounds remaining. It's worth exploring if he can get a better price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily getting closer to Alice's desired price point. This counteroffer of $1,080,000 shows he's willing to compromise but still wants to secure a better price. This offer is a good balance between being too low and pushing Alice away, and being too high and leaving no room for future negotiations. With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic to reach a deal."
