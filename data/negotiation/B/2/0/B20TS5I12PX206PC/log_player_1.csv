Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$600,000 is far too low for me. It's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a price that's anywhere near what the product is worth to me. Rather than continue to waste time negotiating with him, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get a decent price and don't risk ending up with less."
