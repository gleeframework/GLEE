Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to sell the product for at least $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit, which means getting as close to $1,200,000 as possible.

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave Bob some room for profit. This encourages him to accept your offer rather than risk losing out entirely.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You confidently position the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 allows Bob a $50,000 profit margin, which is a good incentive to accept.
* **Focus on ROI:** Emphasize the potential return on investment to appeal to Bob's business sense.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,125,000) to give more room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:** A positive and collaborative tone can go a long way in negotiations.
