"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to your business. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial offer leaves space for negotiation and potential counteroffers, showing a willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob while remaining polite and professional.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Willingness to Pay:** His response will indicate how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.
2. **Anchor the Negotiation:** Starting high sets a reference point that might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
3. **Maintain Control:**  By initiating the negotiation, I set the tone and pace for the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my business needs. I appreciate your initial offer. I would like to propose a lower price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my initial offer and Bob's perceived value of the product.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  By not immediately accepting a lower offer, I reinforce the product's worth.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:** Accepting this early could set a precedent for further lowball offers.
* **Explore Higher Potential Gains:** There's room to negotiate towards a price closer to my target. 

I'm confident that by strategically countering, I can achieve a better outcome than $950,000 without losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to your specific business model is significant.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $50,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique benefits to Bob's business, justifying the higher price.
* **Holding Ground:** This counteroffer still keeps the price well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and closer to Bob's perceived value. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage a Counteroffer:** By making a reasonable concession, I invite Bob to engage in a more collaborative negotiation.
2. **Avoid a Stalemate:**  A smaller price reduction now may prevent a larger gap in future rounds.
3. **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm signaling that while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate to make a deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on this product for my business, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong deal.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price is well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, representing a $200,000 profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've both made concessions, indicating a genuine interest in closing a deal. This price point feels like a fair compromise.
* **Avoiding Further Risk:**  Continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob lowering his offer further. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome. 

While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer of $800,000 is too high.  $1,000,000 represents a substantial win in this negotiation."
