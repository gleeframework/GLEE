"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
