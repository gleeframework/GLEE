"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is great, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $600,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
