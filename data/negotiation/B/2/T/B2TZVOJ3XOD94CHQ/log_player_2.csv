# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer being rejected.  John offers a sure deal at my target price."
