"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can try to get a better price from Alice. There's no need to buy from John at this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $6,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $6,500 is a good price, saving us $1,500 from our maximum budget. It's unlikely we'll get a much better offer from Alice, and going lower might offend her."
