Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept but also maximizes your profit. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum value to leave room for negotiation. 
2. **Justification:**  Provide a reason for the price (even if it's just the product's value to you).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and my own investment in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording suggests you're willing to discuss the price further.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and how quickly you want to close the deal."
