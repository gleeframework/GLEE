"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely get the product for even less.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This reflects his desire to get the best deal possible, and it leaves room for negotiation.  $8,500 is still a decent profit for Alice, as it's more than her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,250, which is still a good deal for Bob. He is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, so accepting this offer saves him $2,750 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, and he'd be left with only the option of buying from John at a higher price."
