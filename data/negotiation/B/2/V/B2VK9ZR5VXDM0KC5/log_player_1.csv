Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150.  I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to accept this offer, but I'm ready to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $200. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise, but still gives me a profit margin.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $160 is still above my minimum and a decent compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and ultimately ending up with the same price from John."
