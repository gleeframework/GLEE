"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message focuses on the value the product offers Bob, rather than emphasizing my own need to sell.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, indicating I'm open to some negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close as possible to my minimum value ($1,500,000) while still keeping the negotiation open. I'll be prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed, but I want to see how Bob responds to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, his message indicates he's interested in making a deal. This opens up the possibility for further negotiation.
* **Time Remaining:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to try and secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum value, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This still leaves room for you to benefit significantly from the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price significantly from the initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the remaining value and potential benefit for Bob, making the price more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate, aiming to encourage further dialogue.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer strikes a balance between my desired value and a price that might be more attractive to Bob. The goal is to encourage him to come up with a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum value, potentially leading to a deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Despite the rejection, Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Time Remains:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiations and potentially secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my minimum value, aiming to inch closer to a deal while leaving room for potential concessions."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer narrows the gap between my minimum acceptable value and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Benefit:** I highlight the mutual benefit of the deal, encouraging Bob to consider a positive outcome.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer represents a significant concession, but it still positions me above my minimum value. By showing flexibility and emphasizing mutual benefit, I hope to persuade Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can meet at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  There is very limited room for further negotiation with Bob, as he has stated $1,200,000 is his absolute maximum.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob is high.

**Strategy:**

Given Bob's firm stance and the limited time remaining, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and avoids the risk of a further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
