"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Please let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is well below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John."
