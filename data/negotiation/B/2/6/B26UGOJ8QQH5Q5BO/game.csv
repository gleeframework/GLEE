"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Please let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
