"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $950,000 is less than $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Alice values the product at $800,000, and you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000. This means there's a potential for a deal that benefits both parties. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  
* **Meeting Alice's Needs:**  $850,000 is still above Alice's valuation of $800,000, making it potentially acceptable to her.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a starting point for further negotiation. It shows I'm serious about buying but am also looking to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than my initial counteroffer:** While Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, the price is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** The gap between Alice's offer and my initial counteroffer is still significant enough to justify another round of negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Rejecting Alice's offer gives me another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer while remaining within my budget. 
* **Fairness:**  $900,000 is still above Alice's valuation of $800,000, suggesting a potential deal that is mutually beneficial.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Alice has moved only slightly from her previous offer, indicating she's unwilling to come down much further.  
* **Close to the Threshold:**  At $985,000, Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Further negotiation might lead to a better deal, but it's risky and time-consuming.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings by continuing to negotiate are minimal compared to the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price.  

**Conclusion:**  Buying from John is the most reasonable choice at this point.  While I'd prefer a lower price, the certainty of securing the product outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal with Alice."
