"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the movement. How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now at that amount.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer the product for $85. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth considering.",85.0,Alice,5,
