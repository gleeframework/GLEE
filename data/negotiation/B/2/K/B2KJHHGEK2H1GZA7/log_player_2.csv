Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $180. Is this something you'd be interested in?

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $165. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $137.5 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we try $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above our maximum, and while we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down enough in the remaining rounds. John offers a sure thing at $150, which meets our budget."
