"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $180. Is this something you'd be interested in?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $165. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle at $137.5? ",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $137.5 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we try $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
