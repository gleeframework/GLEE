"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
