"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price.  There's no point in buying from John yet, as you have rounds to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $10,000. This sets a clear boundary and makes it clear I'm serious about getting a good deal. Alice may reject this, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price.  I want to see if I can get Alice to go even lower. It's worth a few more rounds of negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $10,000 to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within a reasonable range.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if she rejects it, we'll continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $12,000 is within a reasonable range for me. It's still a bit more than my ideal price, but I don't want to risk going too low and losing the deal entirely. It's also worth noting that we only have a few rounds left, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower."
