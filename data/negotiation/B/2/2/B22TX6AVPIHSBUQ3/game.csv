"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is quite low, I understand your perspective on the value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the significant value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and that's great.  $1,000,000 is a bit too close to my minimum though.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,075,000 and we close this out?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a maximum of $1,050,000. Let me know if that works for you and we can get this done.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
