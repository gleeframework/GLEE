"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Starting Point:** I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This creates room for negotiation and establishes my desired price point. 
* **Justify the Price:**  I'm offering a reason for the price to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys that I am open to negotiation, implying flexibility while maintaining a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room to negotiate further with Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on him and signals that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the value of the product while being fair to both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain my minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum price point.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""middle ground"" to make it seem more appealing and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further leverage:**  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round.
* **Time is a factor:**  I'm already on round 4, and I'd rather not risk losing the deal with Bob and potentially having to start from scratch with John.

It's crucial to weigh the potential gains against the risks. In this case, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me my minimum, and it's safer than risking further negotiation or starting anew with John."
