"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no point in accepting it. You have several rounds to negotiate a better price, and it's worth trying to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price. This signals my seriousness in buying the product, but also establishes a clear boundary.  While unlikely Alice will accept this right away, it sets the stage for further negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I have several more rounds to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm also confident that I can secure the product for less with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still keeping it below my maximum acceptable price. This approach aims to signal that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I have several more rounds to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get a better price. It's also worth noting that I can buy the product from John for $8,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm gradually increasing my offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. $10,000 is still below my maximum budget and closer to Alice's last offer, which signals that I'm committed to reaching a deal. However, I'm also aware that I have John as a backup option, so I'm not pressured to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within my acceptable range, and I'm getting closer to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer and we'll be stuck at an impasse. It's a good deal, and I'm confident I can find a way to make it work."
