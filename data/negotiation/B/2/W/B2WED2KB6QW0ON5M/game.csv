"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $9,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
