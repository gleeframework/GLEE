"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers before committing to a price that's higher than your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value I see in your product. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup a bit more for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but her offer is still a bit too high. You're still within your budget, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. By rejecting the offer, you can make another counteroffer and hopefully get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can come to my budget. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,060,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,065,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,065,000 is still above your budget. You've already negotiated several rounds, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to take John's offer of $1,000,000 and avoid any further risk of the negotiation falling apart. This guarantees you the product at your desired price."
