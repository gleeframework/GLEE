I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a good starting point as it's slightly above the value of the product for both of us. It gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still giving Bob a fair price.  We'll see if he's willing to pay this amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While $750,000 is still more than what the product is worth to me, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to counter with $850,000.  This is a good compromise point - it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in this price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob is clearly not willing to come up to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to sell to John for $800,000, as that's a guaranteed sale and will give me a fair price."
