"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that aligns with your interests. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value the product holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and is a price I believe is fair given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
