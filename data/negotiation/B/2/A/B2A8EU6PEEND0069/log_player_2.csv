Round 3

# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value the product holds for you.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
