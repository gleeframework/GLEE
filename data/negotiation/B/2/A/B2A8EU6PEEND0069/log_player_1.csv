Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and is a price I believe is fair given the value of the product.
