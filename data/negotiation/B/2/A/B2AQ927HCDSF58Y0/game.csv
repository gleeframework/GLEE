"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $8,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,750 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $8,250 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $8,000? This would be my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
