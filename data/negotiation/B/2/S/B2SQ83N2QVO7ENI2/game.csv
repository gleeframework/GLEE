"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This would still give you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $108? This way, we can both get a good deal.",108.0,Alice,5,
