"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
