I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This is a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get at least $800,000 from John if the negotiations with Bob fail, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about selling to him. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept my offer."

I've decided to sell to John. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that he's not going to budge further. It's a risk to keep negotiating, and I'm not willing to risk getting a worse deal."
