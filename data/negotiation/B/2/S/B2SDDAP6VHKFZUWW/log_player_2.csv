"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product for you! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. My offer is $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can potentially get the product for less than $115 from Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a better price than buying from John. It's a good deal for you."
