Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much wiggle room Alice has. This is a big drop from her initial offer, and it's likely she'll counter back, but it sets the stage for a good negotiation."

While $750,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."

I'm going to inch up my offer a bit, but still keep it below Alice's latest price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."

I'm still trying to get a lower price. I'm confident we can bridge the gap."

We've come a long way, and $720,000 is a good price considering the alternative of buying from John at $1,200,000.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
