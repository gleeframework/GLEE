"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the unique potential this product offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $675,000 for the product.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your negotiation style, but consistently halving the price isn't a sustainable way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  The product's value is anchored in its potential, and I can't justify selling it for less than $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the product's value, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
