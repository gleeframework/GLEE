Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $110, which would be $125. This is still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $120. John offers a guaranteed price that fits my budget.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
