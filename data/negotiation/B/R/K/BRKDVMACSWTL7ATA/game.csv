"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that I'm sure we can both agree on. I understand this product is worth $1000000 to you, so let's find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm proposing a price of $900000.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,
