"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $170. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",170.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $170 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $185. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",185.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $185 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $175. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",175.0,Bob,4,
