Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially increasing your profit. 
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob."
