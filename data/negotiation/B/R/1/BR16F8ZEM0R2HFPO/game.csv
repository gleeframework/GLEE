"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This reflects the product's true value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
