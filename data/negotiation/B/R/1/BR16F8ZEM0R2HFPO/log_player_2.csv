"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
*  There are 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows for potential negotiation and a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. 
* There are still multiple rounds left, so rejecting and counteroffering again could potentially lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
