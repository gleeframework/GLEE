,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $15,500?  It's a fair price, and I think we can both walk away happy.",15500.0,Alice,5,
