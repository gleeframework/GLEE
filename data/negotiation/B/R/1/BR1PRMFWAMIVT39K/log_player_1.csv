{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, making it attractive for him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer provides a starting point for negotiation, allowing you to potentially secure a higher price without immediately driving Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $130. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is still above my minimum of $120, it's closer to my minimum than to my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 would be my best offer.  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $132.50 is closer to my initial offer of $140 than Bob's previous offer of $130.
* **Above my minimum:**  The offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or continue to counter-offer. Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a price that's both profitable and acceptable to both of us."
