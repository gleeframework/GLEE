"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the best possible deal.
* He's offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but significantly lower than her initial offer.
* This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $13,750. It's a fantastic product and well worth that price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,750 is still above Bob's ideal price point, but it's closer to his budget.
*  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try to get the price down further, especially since Bob has 7 more rounds to work with. 
* Buying from John at $15,000 is still a viable option, but Bob should continue exploring the negotiation with Alice before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,500? "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is staying within his budget while pushing for a better price.
* He's offering a slightly lower price, showing Alice he's serious about making a deal while also leaving room for negotiation.
* He acknowledges Alice's position while also highlighting his own need for a fair price."
