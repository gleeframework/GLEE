{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also significantly lower than my minimum selling price to John, providing a buffer for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale, and I can then move on to other ventures."
