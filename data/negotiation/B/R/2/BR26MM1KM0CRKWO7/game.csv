"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1200000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1700000. This price still reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's work together to find a solution that suits us both.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
