"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I'm glad to see that you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $9,150. What do you think?",9150.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $9,150 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
