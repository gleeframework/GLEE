,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I'd like to explore the possibility of a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have a certain value in mind for the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider other options, including buying from John.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1100000.

Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1080000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more movement. My revised offer is $1055000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might need to explore other options, including buying from John.",1055000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product. My minimum price is $1100000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package. My revised offer is $1100000 for the product, and I think it's a great value considering the extras. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1100000. I'm willing to consider the 5-year warranty and maintenance package, but I need to see a significant reduction in price. My revised offer is $980000, and I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you.",980000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.
