"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I believe this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $13,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  $13,200 is still a bit low for me to accept.  Could you do $13,500?  That's a significant price drop from my original offer and I think it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
