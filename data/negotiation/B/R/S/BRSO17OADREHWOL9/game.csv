"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us. You'll be getting a valuable product for a fair price, and I'll be able to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also trying to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be mindful of your budget, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $11,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a product worth $15,000 for a significant discount. Let's meet in the middle at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000. Can we try $10,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Bob,4,
