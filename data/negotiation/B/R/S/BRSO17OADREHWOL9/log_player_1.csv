Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also trying to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get closer to my desired price."

This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a product worth $15,000 for a significant discount. Let's meet in the middle at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000. Can we try $10,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.
