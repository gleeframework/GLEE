{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value of $10,000 as possible without going below. A counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
