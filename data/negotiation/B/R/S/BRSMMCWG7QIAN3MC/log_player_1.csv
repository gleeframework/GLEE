"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a fair price for me considering the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,900. This is only $150 more than Bob's last offer, showing him I'm getting close to my minimum. I believe we are getting close to an agreement, and this is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $100 less than my last counteroffer and is very close to my minimum.  It's a good deal, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
