Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000.

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to consider one more concession, but I need to make $950,000 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice is still asking for a price higher than my maximum budget. Even though I can negotiate further, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get the price down to what I'm comfortable with. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 and avoid further haggling."
