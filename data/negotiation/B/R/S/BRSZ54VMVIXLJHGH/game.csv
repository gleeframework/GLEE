"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to consider one more concession, but I need to make $950,000 to make it worth my while.",950000.0,Alice,5,
