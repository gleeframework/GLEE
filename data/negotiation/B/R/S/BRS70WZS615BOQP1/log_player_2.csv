Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject and see if she's willing to come down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is far above my budget. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial price.  This is a fair offer that still allows me to cover my minimum requirement.  Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's offer is still quite high. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get her lower.  You still have some room to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,375,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1375000 is still not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1600000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

While $1,600,000 is getting closer, you're still above your budget.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get her lower.  You can still make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price, or you can always opt to buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and allows both of us to reach a deal. Let's finalize this and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
