"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round, and I think this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
