"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good price, there's potential to do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is still attractive to Alice but also saves him some money. He's starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value for the product, hoping to incentivize her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than her original offer and closer to his desired price point.  While there's always a chance to negotiate further, accepting the offer now ensures a purchase at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a higher price or the need to buy from John."
