"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it would be a great addition to your business. I am offering this exceptional product to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable to my business, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point.  Would you consider $700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that you're looking for a deal.
* **Significant but Not Insulting:** A counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but it's not so low as to be insulting. It shows that we're serious but also trying to get a good price. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** We still have the option to go to John for $1,000,000, so we don't want to agree to a price that's too close to that right now."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I believe it holds for your business while remaining competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  How about $750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** We're making a smaller counteroffer this time ($50,000 instead of $100,000). This signals that we're getting closer to our limit and encourages Alice to do the same.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By proposing $750,000, we're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's current price. 
* **Still Below John's Price:**  We're still maintaining a buffer below John's $1,000,000 price, leaving us flexibility in the later rounds."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering the value of the product to your business, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $780,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to offer $765,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 765000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $765,000, we're meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($780,000) and our last counteroffer ($750,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Stronger Language:** We're using more decisive language (""I'm willing to offer"" and ""a fair price"") to signal that we're getting closer to our final offer.
* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds, so we need to start pushing towards a deal if we want to avoid going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. My counteroffer is $770,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value it brings to your business while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $770,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $770,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $770,000 is a very good price for the product, saving us $230,000 compared to Alice's initial offer and well below John's $1,000,000 price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental savings, and we risk Alice becoming less willing to compromise.
* **Time Constraint:** We only have three rounds left. While we could push for a slightly lower price, there's a chance we won't reach an agreement and will have to buy from John at a higher price. 

It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing it for a potentially insignificant additional discount."
