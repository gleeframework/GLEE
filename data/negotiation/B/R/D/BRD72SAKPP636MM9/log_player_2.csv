"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is still a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We start with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $120.  Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met our bottom line!  We can accept this offer and get a good deal."
