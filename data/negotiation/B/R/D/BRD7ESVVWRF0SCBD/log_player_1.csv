Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.  Here's why:

* **Reasoning:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  By offering $1,400,000, I leave some room for negotiation and still make a significant profit. 
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price and ensuring a sale."
