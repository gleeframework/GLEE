Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80. 
* **It's less than Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're not being overly aggressive, just stating your price and inviting Bob to respond. 

Remember, you can adjust this offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $85?  I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is higher than selling to John, it's still below the desired price. It's worth trying to get closer to the $100 mark before accepting.  A counteroffer will keep the negotiation going and might lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. How about $92? It's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $88.  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$88 is a good compromise and a better deal than selling to John for $80. It's close to your desired price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
