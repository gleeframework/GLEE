"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82.50 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80?",80.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! However, I was thinking of a slightly higher price. How about $81.25? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",81.25,Alice,5,
