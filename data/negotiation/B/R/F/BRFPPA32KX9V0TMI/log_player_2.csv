"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. $8000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $16500? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

While $16,500 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You need to continue negotiating to get a better price."
