"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $87 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $89.  Since Bob is now offering $87, I'm trying to meet him halfway.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it will convince him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $88. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $1 less than my minimum and I'm running out of time.  There's a good chance I might not get a better offer, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
