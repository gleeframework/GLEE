"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $2,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to counter, but if he rejects this offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's lowball offer of $1,500,000, it's not worth selling at that price right now. I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still reflecting the value of the product. Hopefully, this price will be appealing enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him a bit further.  I think I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my value.  I'm feeling confident we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a little closer to my initial goal of $2,000,000,  Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is getting very close to my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  It's best to secure this deal and avoid the potential of getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John for the minimum."
