{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, and it's a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying.  I'm also leaving myself the option to sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,800 is simply too low.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. Can you meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, he seems unwilling to meet my minimum price.  I've already made a significant concession, and his offer of $9,500 is still too low.  To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
