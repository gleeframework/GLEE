{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum value while still leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also helps me get closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Let's try $125. This is still under my budget and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to $150 by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $130. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm proposing a compromise again, aiming for a middle ground. While I'm still not at my ideal price of $150, this offer is closer and allows me to gauge Bob's final stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to go up to $127.50. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150. Bob's offer of $127.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal from John. It's not ideal to miss out on the potential to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm prioritizing my minimum value and maximizing my profits."
