"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal, as you'll be getting it for a price that's only slightly higher than its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a bad deal for you. You'd be paying $10 more than your valuation of the product and more than John would charge you. You should reject her offer and see if she'll come down on the price."
