"I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $8250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7800. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the original price was $9500.",7800.0,Bob,4,

I'll offer you a price of $8100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",8100.0,Alice,5,
