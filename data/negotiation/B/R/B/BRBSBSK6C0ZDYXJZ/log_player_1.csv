Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my desired price point of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob and highlight the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and negotiate, showing flexibility. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup, knowing I can get $15,000 from him if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $12,500 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000 and also lower than my initial offer to Bob. Accepting would mean a considerable loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, I can still potentially negotiate a higher price in the next round.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price of $15,000 while still remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Closer to My Target:** I've moved my price closer to my desired $15,000, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to justify the price.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer but not accepting his low offer.
* **Maintain John as Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 provides confidence that I don't need to settle for a significantly lower price."
