Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a significant discount compared to its value to him ($800,000).
* **First Right of Refusal:** By approaching Bob first, I'm giving him the opportunity to acquire the product before moving on to John. This can create a sense of exclusivity and urgency. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters the initial offer."
