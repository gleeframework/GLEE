Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000). This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for some room for negotiation,  as Bob may be willing to counteroffer, but not for a significant drop in price. 
* **Safeguard:** By having John as a backup buyer, I can confidently reject counteroffers that are too low and not risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  Bob clearly values the product at least $8,500, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Minimize risk:**  While rejecting Bob's offer means the negotiation continues, it doesn't completely rule out selling to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a good profit margin. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Midpoint:**  $9,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a reasonable attempt at compromise.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This price leaves room for further negotiation but also sets a clear limit for Bob's counteroffer, making it less likely for him to lowball me again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation limits:**  Bob's offer is getting increasingly closer to my minimum. While I could counteroffer again, there's a strong chance he'll continue to lower his offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price, and it will require additional time and effort.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a safe and efficient option that ensures I get paid.

**Conclusion:**  It's more beneficial to sell to John at this point and secure the guaranteed profit rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
