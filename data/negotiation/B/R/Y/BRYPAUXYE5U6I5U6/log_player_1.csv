"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product at a higher level, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I fully expect Bob to counter-offer, and this initial price gives us space to work towards a mutually agreeable figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than his stated perception of the product's value ($800,000). This suggests there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in Round 3 to try and reach a price closer to $1,600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I see the value you recognize in the product, and I'm motivated to make this work.  How about we settle on $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm starting with an acknowledgment of Bob's counteroffer and a statement that I want to find a deal. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Price Drop:** I've reduced my price by $150,000, which is a significant concession but still keeps me well above my absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise"" that reflects the product's ""true worth,"" I'm subtly anchoring the discussion around a higher value than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's flexibility and help me determine if a deal within my desired range is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is a good deal, even though it's not the highest I could potentially get. Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Profitable:** This price is significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations carries the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures the sale and allows me to reinvest the capital sooner.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has clearly stated his upper limit, making it unlikely he'll go higher. 

While I could push for a slightly higher amount, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer ($1,200,000) outweighs the potential reward."
