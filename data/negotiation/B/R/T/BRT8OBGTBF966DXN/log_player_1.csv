Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is interested but doesn't want to pay that much.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm willing to risk some back and forth to get a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him. If not, I'll happily sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle.  I want to make sure I get as much as possible, but I don't want to risk losing a sale by being too inflexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I still feel I'm getting a fair price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob has come up to $1,250,000. This is a good price and  I'm not sure I can get a better offer.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up selling to John for less.  Let's finalize this deal!"
