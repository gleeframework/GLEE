"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting price is $950,000. Let's chat and see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more competitive price. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $800,000. How about we meet at $825,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to achieve a more profitable sale. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,
