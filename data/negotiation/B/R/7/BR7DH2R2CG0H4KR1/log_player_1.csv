``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, but I think it's a bit high. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I can likely get more by continuing negotiations. I'll try to meet him in the middle with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit high on $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  This would give us both a fair deal and avoid any further haggling. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?

While $1,080,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,080,000 is just a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,120,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1120000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it seems Bob is really pushing for a low price. It's unlikely we'll come to a mutually agreeable price at this point.  To avoid further negotiations, I'll sell to John for $800,000."
