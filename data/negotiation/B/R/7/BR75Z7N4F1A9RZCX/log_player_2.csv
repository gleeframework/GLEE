"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. Would you like to take it for a spin?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is a good deal. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $9000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10000? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough decision. Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is the same price that John is offering, I think I've found the sweet spot. I'd like to accept Alice's offer.
