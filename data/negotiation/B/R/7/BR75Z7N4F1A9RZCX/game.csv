"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. Would you like to take it for a spin?",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,9000.0
"I'm still not convinced that $10500 is a good deal. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $9000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10000? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
