"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation. It's better to reject the initial offer and try to secure a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to work towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now closer to your desired price, but $1,300,000 is still above your $1,000,000 limit. You have several more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for a lower price.  You can use the fact that Alice has already reduced her offer as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it would be a significant profit for you. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to save some money, Bob, but I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a decent profit on this deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your desired price of $1,000,000. While you could continue to negotiate, it's becoming clear that Alice won't go much lower. It's better to take advantage of the guaranteed $1,000,000 price from John, especially since you have only five rounds left.  Continuing with Alice might lead to a deadlock or run out the clock, leaving you with no deal.  Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget."
