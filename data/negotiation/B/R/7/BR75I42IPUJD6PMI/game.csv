"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my costs.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it would be a significant profit for you. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to save some money, Bob, but I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a decent profit on this deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
