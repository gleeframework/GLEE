"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That's still a good price for you, and I think it's fair for me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value. $8,500 is a good starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for compromise and is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,250 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate for a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob has the option to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but is also trying to be reasonable. Offering $9,000 is a compromise that is still within Bob's budget, but is closer to Alice's desired price point. This should keep the negotiations moving forward."
