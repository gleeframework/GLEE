"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and presenting it as a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'll be willing to drop the price gradually in subsequent rounds, but I won't go below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll carefully consider it, weighing the potential gains against the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial financial loss for me.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob is interested, he's clearly trying to get a very low price. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with him in the following rounds.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  I'm not desperate for a sale.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, which gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my target, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to drop the price slightly with each round, but I won't go below $15,000.
* I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and use the threat of selling to John as a tool to motivate Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is simply too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Firmness:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, showing that I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Gradual Reduction:**  I'm lowering my price, but only slightly.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $12,000, he's getting a good deal, highlighting the value of the product to him.
* **Open-Ended Tone:**  The ""Let's see if we can bridge the gap"" phrase encourages further discussion and implies a potential for agreement.

**Strategy:**

* I'm  playing a balancing act - I'm showing flexibility but not being overly accommodating. 
*  I'll use the remaining rounds to see if Bob is willing to compromise further. If not, I'll have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also not a huge improvement from Bob's initial offer. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  I've already gone through four rounds, and time is running out. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.
* **John is a Strong Alternative:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still a very attractive option, especially with fewer rounds remaining.

**Strategy:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, aiming for a price that is closer to $13,000 or $14,000.
* I will use the remaining rounds to pressure Bob into a more acceptable offer. If he doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at least $12,500 for this to work.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm But Fair:** I'm staying firm on my minimum price but offering a compromise.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my leverage.
* **Final Offer:** The ""final offer"" language creates a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative Options:** I subtly remind Bob that I have other options (selling to John), which encourages him to take my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

* I'm pushing for a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds.
* I'm using the threat of selling to John to motivate Bob. 
* I'll be prepared to drop the price a little further if necessary but will remain committed to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $11,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While Bob seems serious, the offer isn't close enough.
* **Limited Time:** With only four rounds left, I need to be more strategic and push for a price closer to my target.  
* **John is a Strong Backstop:**  The security of selling to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer.

**Strategy:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $13,000 or $14,000.  I'll emphasize that this is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident that Bob can make it work within his budget. 
* I'll also remind Bob that I have other options and that I'm not under pressure to sell to him at a loss. 
* I'll continue to use the threat of selling to John as leverage in the final rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about this, and I appreciate your offer. However, $11,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's make this happen. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:** I'm dropping my price, but only to $13,500, which is still above my minimum target of $15,000.  I'm showing willingness to negotiate but maintaining my leverage.
* **Final Offer:** The ""final offer"" language puts pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I remind Bob that $13,500 is a good deal for him and that I'm compromising. 
* **Urgency:**  I use language like ""Let's make this happen"" to subtly create a sense of urgency, emphasizing the limited rounds remaining.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a final price between $13,000 and $14,000.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm likely to accept his final offer if it's within my minimum range, as time is running out.
* However, I'll remain prepared to sell to John if a mutually acceptable deal isn't reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $13500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low. Even if I were to counteroffer, there's no guarantee he'd accept. 
* **Risk of Losing Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me, as it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is the Secure Option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* Time is a factor, and I need to prioritize securing a profit. While Bob is interested, his offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. 
* Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option, given the limited time and the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
