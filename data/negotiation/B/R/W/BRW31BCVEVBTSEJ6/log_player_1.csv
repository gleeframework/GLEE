{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $9,000 because I can still get a better price.  I am confident I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer of $8,500. While it is less than I initially hoped for, it is still significantly higher than selling to John for $8,000.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't have the time to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
