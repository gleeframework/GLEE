Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might make him more inclined to consider it.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not asking for the full $1,500,000 right away, which keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a better price.
* **Ready to walk away:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is appealing, but the price is a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I have John as a backup, so I don't need to settle for a price that's too low for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested, and I can try to meet somewhere in the middle with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price, rather than focusing on the price reduction from my previous offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, suggesting a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making an effort to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I've already moved significantly in my counteroffers.  I'm not confident that Bob will come up much higher.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, which is significantly better than what I'm getting from Bob. 

It's better to secure the higher price from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower offer or losing time."
