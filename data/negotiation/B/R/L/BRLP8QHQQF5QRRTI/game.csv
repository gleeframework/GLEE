"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which still leaves room for you to make a good profit. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it gives you a good deal while still allowing me to achieve my goals. I'm open to discussing this further, but this is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
