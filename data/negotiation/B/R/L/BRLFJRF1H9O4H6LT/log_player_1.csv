"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I still have 9 rounds left and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? It's a fair price, and I believe you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:**  This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns while still emphasizing the value of the product. I'm aiming for a quick resolution, suggesting a fair price that should be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $13,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500, which would be $13,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $13,250, which is only $250 away from my minimum.  While I'd prefer more, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high at this point. The negotiations have already taken several rounds, and I don't want to risk having Bob walk away completely. Accepting this offer is the most logical move, as it guarantees a sale and minimizes the chance of a counteroffer that might lead to a lower price."
