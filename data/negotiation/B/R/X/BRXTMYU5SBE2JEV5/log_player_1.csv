Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his $120 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still above my minimum value. While I'd like to get closer to $100, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
