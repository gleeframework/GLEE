"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $820,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $820,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be open to $780,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and the fact we're both willing to negotiate.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",810000.0,Alice,7,
