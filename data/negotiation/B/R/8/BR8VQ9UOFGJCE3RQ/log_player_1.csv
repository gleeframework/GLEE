"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high initial price, even though you're willing to go significantly lower. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $2,000,000 starting point leaves ample space for negotiation before reaching Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 and your minimum of $1,500,000.

This strategy allows you to:

1. **Test Bob's willingness:** A quick acceptance would be ideal, but his counteroffer will reveal how much he truly values the product.
2. **Maintain control:**  By initiating with a strong offer, you set the initial negotiating tone.
3. **Keep the John option open:** You can always walk away and accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob are not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price you've offered. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is quite good, it's still below your aspirational target. You have room to negotiate further and try to secure a price closer to $2,000,000.  You're also still comfortably above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000).

**Strategy for Round 3:**  You'll need to counter with an offer lower than your initial $2,000,000, but not drastically so. Aim for a price that shows flexibility but still emphasizes the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair reflection of the product's potential and our ongoing discussions."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've reduced your price by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Anchoring:** By keeping the price relatively close to your initial offer, you're trying to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Justification:** The message continues to highlight the product's potential, subtly reminding Bob of the benefits it offers.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Encourage a counter from Bob:** Hopefully, he'll move closer to your $1,900,000.
* **Maintain a profitable position:** You're still aiming for a price significantly above your absolute minimum. 
* **Avoid stalling negotiations:** You're making steady progress while remaining aware of the 10-round limit and the John option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to your price, but his offer of $1,700,000 is getting uncomfortably close to your absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  You still have room to negotiate and several rounds left.

**Strategy for Round 5:**

* **Smaller Concession:** Reduce your counteroffer, but by a smaller amount (around $50,000) to signal that you're reaching your limit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Subtly remind Bob of the other buyer (John) to introduce a bit of time pressure without revealing your exact alternative. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining pressure on Bob to improve his offer significantly to close the deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. I've adjusted my price to $1,850,000. This is a significant investment on your part, but I truly believe in the value this product holds for your business. I do have other interested parties, but I value our discussions and would like to see if we can finalize this soon."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** The price reduction of $50,000 shows willingness to negotiate, but also indicates you're approaching your limit.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reaffirms the product's worth to Bob's business, subtly justifying the price.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" without being overly aggressive introduces a sense of urgency for Bob to make a more competitive offer.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Encourage a strong counter:** Bob might be more motivated to move closer to your price knowing you have other options.
* **Maintain control:**  You're still dictating the pace and direction of the negotiation.
* **Keep the John option viable:** You haven't revealed your hand entirely, allowing you to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is too close to your absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting a worse offer, or having Bob walk away, outweighs the potential upside of squeezing out a slightly higher price.

It's time to cut your losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  This ensures a profitable deal without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
