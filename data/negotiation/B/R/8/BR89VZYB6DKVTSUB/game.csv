"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a fair value for the product. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a price point that works for both of us. Could you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $775,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
