Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer of $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a profit for you.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price of $119 seems like a ""deal"" compared to a rounded number like $120, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $119. However, since his perceived value is $100, it's unlikely he'd offer significantly more than that. This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while still maintaining a high probability of a sale."
