"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to settle for $9,000. I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I also know I can always sell to John for $10,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $9,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,750, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,750, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Given that I can sell to John for $10,000, it's in my best interest to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
