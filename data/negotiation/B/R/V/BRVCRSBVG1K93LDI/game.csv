"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $9,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,750, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9750.0,Alice,5,
