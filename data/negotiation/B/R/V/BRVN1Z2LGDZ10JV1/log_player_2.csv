"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer allows room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is intentionally lower than my target price. This tactic creates room for negotiation and potentially encourages Alice to make a more significant price reduction in the next round. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest in the product, which can contribute to a smoother negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, $8,500 is still higher than John's offer.  We have room to negotiate, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm working with a tight budget, and I could manage around $7,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  While we want to stay below $8,000, increasing our offer to $7,000 shows Alice we're willing to move closer to her price point. 
* **Budget Justification:** By reiterating the budget limitations, it maintains pressure for Alice to make concessions.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open to further discussion, hoping to encourage Alice to counter with a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on this price, especially since John offers the same price."
