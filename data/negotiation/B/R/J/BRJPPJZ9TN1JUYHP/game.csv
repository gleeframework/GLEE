"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $95.  This way, we both get a good deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
