"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $120.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point for negotiation, and we can adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a point where it's a better deal than John's offer. We'll reject and try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're getting closer. This counter-offer splits the difference between Alice's current price and our target.  Let's see if she's willing to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $95.  This way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is willing to meet in the middle at $95.  This is a reasonable price and saves us $5 compared to John's offer. It's a good deal!"
