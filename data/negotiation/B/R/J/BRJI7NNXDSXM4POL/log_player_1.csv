"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate the offer, but $80 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Can you think about going a bit lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $100, $85 is a good price considering the back-and-forth.  It's above my minimum and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
