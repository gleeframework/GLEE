"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,

This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $975000 is a reasonable price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $1075000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher.

"Alice, I'm sorry to say that I'm not willing to go any higher than $990000. I've already stretched my budget to the limit, and I'm not comfortable going above that. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I think we've reached an impasse. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,10,
