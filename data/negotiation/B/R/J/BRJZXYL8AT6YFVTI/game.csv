"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum price is $800,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the fair value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my original asking price reflects the true potential and worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept a price as low as $800,000.  Would you consider $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too far off from what I can afford.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the significant increase in your offer. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,750,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the true value of the product while recognizing your investment.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
