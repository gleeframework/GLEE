"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's, it's still a good deal for Bob. However, there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $5,500.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 5500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $5,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $6,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible or Bob could end up paying more by going to John.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
