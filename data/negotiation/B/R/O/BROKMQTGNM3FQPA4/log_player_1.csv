Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This price aligns more closely with my valuation and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to get a price closer to $1,075,000."
