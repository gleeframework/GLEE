Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob, as it's still lower than the product's worth to him ($150)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product for $105. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that's still attractive to Bob while also maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob is consistently offering close to my minimum. It's getting late in the negotiation and I'm not sure we'll be able to get much higher. Accepting his offer at $90 is the best course of action to ensure a sale and maximize my profits."
