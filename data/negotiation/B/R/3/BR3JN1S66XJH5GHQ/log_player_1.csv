Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. It's also a good way to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a price closer to your desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is your minimum, it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  Bob is clearly interested, and you have some leverage knowing John is also willing to buy for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$85 is a good compromise, especially given that John is also offering $80.  It's close to your desired price and ensures the sale."
