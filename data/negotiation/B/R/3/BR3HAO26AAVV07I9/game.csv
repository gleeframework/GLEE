"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My starting price is $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're eager to acquire this product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $950,000 still falls short of my desired price point. To make this deal work, I need to see $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me to achieve my business goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. If we can't meet on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
