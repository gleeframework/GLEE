"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice's offer is above that. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a step closer to his budget, he's still willing to pay up to $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a better price. I can offer it to you for $10800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $10,800 is still slightly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of getting stuck at a higher price."
