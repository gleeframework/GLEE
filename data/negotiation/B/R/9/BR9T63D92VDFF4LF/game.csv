"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with $1,750,000, which leaves room for negotiation. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and go with $1,450,000? I'm confident that this price is fair to both of us, and it gives you a significant discount on the original price. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's try $1,425,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us to both get a fair deal.  We're getting close, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. I think this is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is getting very close, but I still need to reach $1,450,000 to make this deal work for me. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident this is the last adjustment needed to close the deal. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $1,375,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the maximum I can pay. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. What do you think?",1375000.0,Bob,8,
