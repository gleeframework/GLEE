"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
