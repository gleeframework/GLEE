"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and John is offering the product at that price, it's the most logical choice.  There's no point in negotiating with Alice when you have a guaranteed deal at your price limit."
