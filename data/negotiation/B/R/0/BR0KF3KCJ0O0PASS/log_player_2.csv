"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it signals Bob's seriousness in negotiating and his willingness to walk away if necessary.  He's hoping Alice will be motivated to compromise given that John is willing to sell for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is now within Bob's budget.  While he'd prefer to pay John's $10,000, the potential for further negotiation with Alice is uncertain.  Since he's already negotiated a lower price, it's in his best interest to accept Alice's offer and finalize the purchase."
