It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're unlikely to get much higher than $1,275,000 from Bob. He's been consistently raising his offer, but in smaller increments. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round we spend negotiating with Bob is a risk. The longer it takes, the greater the chance he walks away or we miss out on other opportunities (like John's offer).
* **Solid Profit:**  While not ideal, $1,275,000 is a significant profit margin. It surpasses Bob's valuation and is closer to my target than John's guaranteed offer. 

Accepting now locks in a good deal and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower offer or even losing both buyers."
