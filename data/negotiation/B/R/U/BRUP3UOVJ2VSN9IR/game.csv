"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $16000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $15000?  That would be a good price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $15000. How about we meet at $16500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think!",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $16500 is a bit higher than I'd like, I'm willing to go to $15500. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16500 and $15500, which would be $16000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",15500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $16250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think!",16250.0,Alice,9,
