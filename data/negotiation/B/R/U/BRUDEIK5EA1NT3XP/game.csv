"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125.  Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $125 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the value.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little hesitant at $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",127.5,Bob,4,
