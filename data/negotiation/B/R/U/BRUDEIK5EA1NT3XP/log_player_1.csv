Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob.

This approach balances the desire to earn as much money as possible with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I'm willing to accept.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed $150 sale with John, so I have no urgency to settle for a lower price with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $125 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the value."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive. 

By offering $130, I'm still trying to get a higher price than Bob's initial offer while demonstrating flexibility and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little hesitant at $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $127.50 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. 
* **Close to the middle:** While it's closer to my desired price than before, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm hoping to get a slightly better price.
* **John's offer remains:**  I have a guaranteed $150 offer from John, which gives me the freedom to continue negotiating with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a slightly higher price in my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $129. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 129}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm reframing my offer as a fair deal for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using a slightly more assertive tone (""Let's close this deal!"") to push Bob towards acceptance. 

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, and it introduces a subtle sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
