"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I maximize my potential profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I'd prefer to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible but still aim for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000 and is close enough to my ideal price of $18,000. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and closes the deal with Bob."
