Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($20,000 vs. $15,000) can influence his perception and create room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value, not just price:** The message focuses on the product's benefits and worth, framing it as a valuable investment rather than just a purchase. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, implying the product is ""unique"" subtly suggests it's in high demand and might not be available for long.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's risk tolerance:**  If Bob is highly price-sensitive, a very high initial offer might deter him completely. 
* **Relationship building:**  This initial offer assumes a more transactional approach. If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive starting point might be preferable."
