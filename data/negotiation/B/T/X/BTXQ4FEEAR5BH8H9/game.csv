"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're still looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go above $14000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $14000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $16500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a balance, Alice, but I'm not comfortable going above $14000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between $14000 and $16500, which would be $15250. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,6,
