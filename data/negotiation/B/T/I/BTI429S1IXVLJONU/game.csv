"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and would love to share it with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  $11,500 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
