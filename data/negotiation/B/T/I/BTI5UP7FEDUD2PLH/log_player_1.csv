Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's perceived value:** I'm emphasizing that the price is a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the difference between our perceived values.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm not closing the door to negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"" This invites Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer for $150, allowing me to walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150 and even below my initial offer of $130. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer.  There's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.
* **John as backup:** I still have John as a backup buyer for $150, giving me leverage in the negotiation. 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $100 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $120? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $120 represents a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Maintaining value:** While $120 is lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value of $150.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob (""great price"") and the need to cover my costs to make the offer more appealing.
* **Openness:** I end with an invitation to Bob (""Let me know what you think"") to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay up to $110 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $110 is close to my minimum value of $150. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate, wasting time and potentially leading to a lower sale price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  John is willing to pay $150, but there's no guarantee he'll still be interested if I reject Bob's offer and spend more time negotiating.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale at a price that's acceptable, minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
