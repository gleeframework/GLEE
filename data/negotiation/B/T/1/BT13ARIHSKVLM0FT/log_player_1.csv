Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $150 to me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm also ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $200. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110.  This is a good compromise that I think Bob will be more likely to accept. It's closer to his offer but still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my asking price, it's taking too many rounds and I'm not sure if we'll ever come to an agreement. John is offering me a guaranteed $150, so I'm going to sell to him."
