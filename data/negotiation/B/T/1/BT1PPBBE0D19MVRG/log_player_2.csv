"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** Alice states the product is worth at least $800,000 to her. This suggests she might be willing to sell for a lower price if you negotiate.
* **Your maximum:** You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity cost:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you have the chance to negotiate a better price with her or purchase from John for your maximum.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Alice's offer gives you more leverage. You can either try to negotiate with Alice or move to John as a backup option."
