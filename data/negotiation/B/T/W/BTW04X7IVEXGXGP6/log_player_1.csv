"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it holds significant potential for you. I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to exploring options that work for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I start with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I frame the offer as a starting point and emphasize my willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process.
* **No Mention of John:** I don't reveal my alternative buyer (John) at this stage.  Keeping this information confidential strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I am looking to keep the investment within a budget of $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the value this product brings.  To move forward, I can offer it to you for $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic assessment of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but stand firm that it's too low. My counteroffer of $1,900,000 is a significant drop from my initial price but still comfortably above my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value, subtly suggesting that my price is justified. 
* **Strategic Concession:** The large price drop signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm not yet nearing a point of accepting his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still committed to finding a price that aligns with my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
