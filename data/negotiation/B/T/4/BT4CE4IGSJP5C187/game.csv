"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am unable to accept $100 for the item, as it does not reflect its true value. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway, at $125? This still allows for a reasonable profit for us while remaining competitive in the market.",125.0,Alice,3,
