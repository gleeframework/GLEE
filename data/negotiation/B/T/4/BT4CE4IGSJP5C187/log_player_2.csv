"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection, given its value. I am offering it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering its worth to us and its value to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price that's closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am unable to accept $100 for the item, as it does not reflect its true value. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway, at $125? This still allows for a reasonable profit for us while remaining competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to our budget, but we can still try to get a better deal. It's worth another counter-offer before accepting $125 or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counter-offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. How about $110?  That's a fair price that works for me."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims for a price point slightly above our best alternative (John's $120 offer) but still significantly below Alice's current offer. This leaves room for one final potential counter-offer from Alice while ensuring we don't overpay if she rejects and we go with John."
