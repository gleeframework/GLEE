Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

This offer reflects the product's unique worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.  To be frank, $1,400,000 is a tough pill to swallow for a product of this caliber.  However, I value your business and want to see this deal through. My final offer is $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, it's still above his preferred price point. He has a few more rounds to try and negotiate a better price.  There is a chance that Alice might be willing to come down further if he rejects the offer and counteroffers again."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant investment for me.  I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
