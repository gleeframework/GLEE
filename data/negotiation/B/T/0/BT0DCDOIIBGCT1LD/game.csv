"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'd be willing to accept. This product has tremendous potential and I'm confident it will bring you a considerable return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's potential, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Would you consider $1,012,500? This splits the difference between our last two offers.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
