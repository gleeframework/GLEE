{""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible, but acknowledging that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her initial counter-offer. This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise, but still remains significantly lower than Alice's last offer."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is a good price for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counter-offer or the negotiation stalling increases. At this point, accepting the offer guarantees a purchase at a price significantly lower than John's offer, with the potential to save more than $375,000."
