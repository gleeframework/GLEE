"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value might make Bob more willing to compromise. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** The $18,000 price leaves space for Bob to counteroffer while still allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this point. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial value.  
* **Risk of selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, there's a chance I could potentially get a better deal with Bob through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $12,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,000? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal now. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** My counteroffer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Bridging the gap:**  This offer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and direct:** The message is clear, concise, and encourages a quick decision.

**Strategy:** 

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved my minimum goal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll continue to negotiate in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my desired value.
* I'm still keeping John as a backup option, as he offers a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to keep it under $13,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** $13,500 is still slightly above my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob is showing flexibility and a willingness to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, but there's a chance I can close the deal with Bob for a slightly higher price through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in Round 5, aiming for a price closer to $14,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer to what we can work with.  Let's try $14,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $14,000 is closer to my ideal price while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I emphasize the value of the product and hope to motivate Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a favorable price and closed the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might become the more attractive option."
