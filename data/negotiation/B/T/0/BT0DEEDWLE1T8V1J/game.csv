"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this point. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $12,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,000? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal now. Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to keep it under $13,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer to what we can work with.  Let's try $14,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
