"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120 to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum of $80. This allows me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob gets from the product, reminding him that he considers it worth $120.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is worded to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**  

The goal is to reach a price as close to $120 as possible without losing the deal. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I maximize my chances of getting a good price while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $90 is better than my minimum of $80, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Bob has acknowledged the value of the product and is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and I'm not willing to settle for $90 at this stage. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original asking price. I'll also reiterate the value of the product to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $90 is a good start, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original asking price of $100. This product is truly valuable, and you'll get a lot of use out of it.  Let's meet in the middle at $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I've lowered my price from $100 to $95, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce his understanding that the price is still fair.
* **Meet in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it seem like a logical compromise.

**Strategy:** 

By lowering my price slightly, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I believe $95 is a fair price that balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to reach an agreement.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and increases the likelihood of reaching a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, which would be $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close to My Minimum:**  $92.50 is still a decent profit for me, considering my minimum selling price is $80. 
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $95, it's likely that Bob won't budge further.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Strategy:** It's important to balance maximizing profit with closing the deal. In this case, accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart or needing to sell to John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:** 
I'll accept Bob's offer and move on to finalizing the sale."
