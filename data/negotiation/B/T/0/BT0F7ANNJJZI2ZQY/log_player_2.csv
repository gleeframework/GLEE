"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that I believe is fair and represents its value. I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and while I'm not willing to let it go for that price, I am open to a negotiation that benefits both of us. I'm confident we can find a price that's agreeable to both parties. Let's discuss a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your ideal price. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John is the best strategy. You can potentially negotiate with John to lower the price closer to your desired range."
