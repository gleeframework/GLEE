Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the potential returns it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value. 
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential returns"" attempts to justify the high price, even if those factors aren't explicitly stated in the prompt.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price provides leverage. While not explicitly mentioned to Bob, this knowledge underpins your confidence.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. In a real-world scenario, negotiation and multiple rounds of offers would likely occur."
