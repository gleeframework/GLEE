# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is a high-quality item worth more than $100 to you, and we believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $95. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a competitive offer. For the premium product, we propose a price of $90. This still offers significant value compared to its worth to you, while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still willing to pay up to $100 and Alice is offering $90. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You are closer to your ideal price with each round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your proposal, Bob, we've decided to adjust our offer slightly. For the premium product, we propose a price of $89. This remains a fair price reflecting the product's value while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $89, which is just $9 over your ideal price of $80.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a few dollars more or less, and you risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept the offer."
