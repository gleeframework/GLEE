"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than his initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually acceptable price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my target. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John would guarantee my minimum value, I'd be leaving money on the table. I want to see if I can get closer to my target with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000 to make this deal work.  This price still offers you a significant return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm still above Bob's offer, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the potential return on investment for Bob, reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This strategy aims to bridge the gap between our offers while maintaining my position and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my target:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is only $50,000 away from my last counteroffer and is much closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rejections, and the remaining rounds might not be enough to close the gap to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is not necessary:** While selling to John would guarantee my minimum value, Bob's offer is close enough that I can accept it and avoid potentially missing out on a good deal.

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and secure a good price, maximizing my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
