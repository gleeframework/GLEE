"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000 to make this deal work.  This price still offers you a significant return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
