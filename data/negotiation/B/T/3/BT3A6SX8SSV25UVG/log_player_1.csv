Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and positive tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product can make Bob more likely to consider your offer. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price while leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price.
* **Alternative option:**  While John offers a guaranteed $150, I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. This gives me a chance to explore further negotiation possibilities before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a justification for my counteroffer by highlighting the product's value.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for further discussion and potential agreement. 

By making a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement with Bob while still maintaining a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Further negotiation might only result in a very small price increase.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, eliminating any risk of a lower offer or a failed negotiation.

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the potential gain is small, and the risk of a prolonged negotiation or a lower final price is real.  John offers a guaranteed and acceptable price, making him the best option at this point."
