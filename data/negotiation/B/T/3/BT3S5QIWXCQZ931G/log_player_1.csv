Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope you can understand my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob's offer is now reasonably close to my target, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. Accepting $1,030,000 guarantees a good profit."
