"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger stretch than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I can't let it go for less than $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't justify going higher than $800,000.  That's my absolute limit. If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
