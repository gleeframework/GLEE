,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
