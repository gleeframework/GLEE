Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to my ideal value through continued negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,625,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, it's still a good deal for me, and it seems unlikely I can get much higher with Bob.  It's also a lot better than selling to John."
