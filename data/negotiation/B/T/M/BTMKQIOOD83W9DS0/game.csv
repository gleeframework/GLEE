"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget concerns, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. Could you meet me halfway at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a good price, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $115, which would be $97.50. Could you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
