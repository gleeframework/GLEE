Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone even higher. If he negotiates, I have information to work with.
* **Alternative Option:** I am aware that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $100. This gives me leverage in the negotiation, as I don't need to settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own stated value for the product ($100). While I want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget concerns, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. Could you meet me halfway at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Not Really):** While I'm suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm actually proposing a price much closer to my initial offer than Bob's counteroffer. This anchors the negotiation closer to my desired range. 
* **Justification:** I'm implying the product has value beyond what Bob might currently perceive, which could make him more willing to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation, as Bob might counter again. However, I'm moving closer to my fallback option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a good price, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $115, which would be $97.50. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $97.50 is reasonably close to both my minimum price and John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
