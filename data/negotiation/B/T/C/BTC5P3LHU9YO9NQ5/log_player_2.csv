"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $900,000 is close to your maximum budget, and you want to save as much as possible.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you leverage to negotiate aggressively with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $800,000. This shows you are serious about buying, but also trying to get a good deal.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** You have 9 rounds remaining, so this allows for a bit of negotiation back and forth.
* **Using John's offer as leverage:** Knowing you have an alternative at $1,000,000 makes you confident in proposing a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still closer to your maximum budget than you'd like. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's still time to continue negotiating, and you've shown Alice you are willing to walk away.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  This option ensures you have a fallback if negotiations with Alice don't go your way."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's minimum:**  This offer is at Alice's minimum acceptable price, showing that you understand her needs and are willing to be fair.
* **Creating pressure:**  Since this is a relatively low offer, it creates pressure on Alice to accept. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Alice rejects, you can always go to John, but this offer gives you a good chance of closing the deal at a favorable price."
