Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob could increase your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $110 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message highlights a ""special price,"" subtly implying it's a better deal than what Bob might find elsewhere. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than your guaranteed sale to John."
