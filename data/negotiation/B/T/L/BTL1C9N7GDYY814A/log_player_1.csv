``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still being attractive to Bob, as the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $90. This is still a good deal for him, as the product is worth $100 to him, and it's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $82 is better than selling to John for $80. I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
