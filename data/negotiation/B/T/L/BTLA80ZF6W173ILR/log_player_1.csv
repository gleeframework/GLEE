Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice is secure knowing John will purchase the product for her minimum acceptable price, giving her leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
