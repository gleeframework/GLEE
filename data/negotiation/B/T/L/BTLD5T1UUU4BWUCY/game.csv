"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really benefit from it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000.

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the benefits you'll gain from it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more aggressive offer of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. That's my minimum acceptable price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll offer it to you for $775000. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing my profit margin.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $700000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $700000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including buying the product from John for $1000000.",700000.0,Bob,6,
