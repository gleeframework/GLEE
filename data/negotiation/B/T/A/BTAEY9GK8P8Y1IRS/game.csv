"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $7,500. I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",9000.0,Alice,5,
