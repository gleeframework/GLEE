"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we meet at $108? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to $100 as possible.",108.0,Bob,4,
