{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $12,000, so you have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're also not giving away the farm.

This strategy allows you to potentially earn more than $12,000 if Bob is willing to pay a little more, while still having the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John for a higher price. It's not worth taking a huge loss to close the deal quickly. Rejecting his offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer that is more beneficial to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Is still above Bob's valuation:**  This keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives Bob some incentive to accept.
* **Is closer to your minimum:** You've moved closer to your minimum acceptable price, but you still have some wiggle room. 

This approach gives you the best chance of reaching an agreement while still protecting your financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant discount from your desired price.  You have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which is significantly higher. It's not worth settling for a price that is below your minimum, especially with a guaranteed alternative.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is closer to your target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little bit more, how about $11,250?  This would still be a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11250}

* **Is closer to your minimum:** You've moved closer to your minimum acceptable price, but you still have some wiggle room.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay up to $10,500, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly stuck at $10,500, which is far below your minimum acceptable price.  You've made several concessions, but he's not willing to budge. It's time to cut your losses and sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's not your ideal outcome, but it's the best option given the circumstances."
