Alice's offer:

Even though Alice has come down in price, it's still better to see if we can negotiate a price closer to John's offer.  We haven't lost anything by continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point. $7,500 is a bit closer.  However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  How about we compromise at $8,000?  It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Alice has met your bottom line. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John, as they both offer the same price now."
