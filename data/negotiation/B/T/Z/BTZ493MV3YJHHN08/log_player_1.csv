Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a unique item and I believe it would be of great value to you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle closer to $15,000 if needed, ensuring you make more than your minimum.
* **High Starting Point:**  A high initial price can sometimes anchor the negotiation in your favor.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. You need to weigh the potential for higher profit against the certainty of John's offer."
