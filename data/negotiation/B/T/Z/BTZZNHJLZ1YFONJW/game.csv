"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1075000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1025000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
