"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
