"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $8,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and I'd still make a good profit. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
