"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is a significant markup from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts. 

This strategy aims to:

* Get a good starting price.
* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* Keep the negotiation open and potentially lead to a better deal in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's message indicates he's willing to pay a premium, suggesting he values the product higher than $10,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal in the next rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price higher than $10,000, but lower than my initial offer, to show a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  While I can't go all the way down to $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $10,750.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and avoids unnecessary details.

**Strategy:**

* By offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate.
* The price point still offers a good profit margin for me. 
* The message encourages a quick response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Can we try $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Limited Time:** We are already in round 4, and time is running out. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  If I reject and counteroffer, there's a chance Bob might reject again, and I might not be able to get a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer a higher price, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer at this point.  I'm securing a decent profit with minimal risk of losing the deal entirely."
