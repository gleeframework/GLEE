"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my minimum price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My counteroffer is $1,225,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still interested in this product.  I'm going to make one final offer: $1,175,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's the fairest we can reach.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,250,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. My final counteroffer is $1,250,000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
