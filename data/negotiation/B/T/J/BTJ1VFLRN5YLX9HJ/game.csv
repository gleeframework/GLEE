"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking maybe around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the quality. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $110 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a slightly lower price? I was thinking maybe around $100? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
