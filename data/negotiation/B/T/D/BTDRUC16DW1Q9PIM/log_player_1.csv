Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? This price gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

I'm still trying to get closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I am willing to pay $1,362,500 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached the point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum. Even if I reject this offer and counter, there's a good chance he'll reject my offer and I'll end up with a lower price.  I'm better off selling to John and guaranteeing my minimum price."
