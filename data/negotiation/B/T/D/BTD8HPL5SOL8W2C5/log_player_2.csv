"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. It's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this deal happen!

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has come down to $10,000, which is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiations with Alice, especially since he has a guaranteed deal with John."
