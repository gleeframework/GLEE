Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's interested. 
* **Alternative Option:** By highlighting the value, I subtly remind Bob that I have other options if he rejects the offer."
