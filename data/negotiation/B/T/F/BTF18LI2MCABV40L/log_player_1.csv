"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets a strong initial position and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm also mindful of the $1,000,000 offer from John, which provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I believe there is still room for a mutually agreeable deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's still within the realm of what Bob is willing to pay. This also keeps my options open with John if Bob continues to be stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. This deal is still significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and it allows me to close the deal quickly without risking further negotiation rounds."
