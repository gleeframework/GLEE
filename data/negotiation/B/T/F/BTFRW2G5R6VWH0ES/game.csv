,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $7500?  I think that's a fair price considering what I'm looking for.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 9000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 8500? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $8000? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 8000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at 8250? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",8250.0,Alice,5,
