"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's too early to commit to buying from Alice at $9,000. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $7,500?  I think that's a fair price considering what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 9000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 8500? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll try to get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 8000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at 8250? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer is close enough to my maximum budget that it's worth accepting.  I'm saving $6,750 compared to buying from John, and further negotiation might not get me much more."
