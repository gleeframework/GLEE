"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Could we settle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,250,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. It reflects the true value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
