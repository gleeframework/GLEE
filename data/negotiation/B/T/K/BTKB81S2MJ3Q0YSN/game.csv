"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider closing the deal for $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,850,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
