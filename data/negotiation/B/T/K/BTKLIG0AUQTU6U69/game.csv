"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you meet me somewhere closer to $10,000?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a great product, and I think it's worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to make the sale. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",11000.0,Alice,5,
