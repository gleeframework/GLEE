"I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $13,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a reasonable compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,
