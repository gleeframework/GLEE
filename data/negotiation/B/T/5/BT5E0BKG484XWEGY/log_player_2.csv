"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start the negotiation by making a significant counteroffer. He's offering $120, which is a reasonable starting point given his budget and Alice's value for the product. This leaves room for further negotiation, but also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still within the range where negotiation is likely to get him a better deal.  Bob wants to push for a price closer to his $120 counteroffer, so he should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by slightly increasing his offer from $120 to $125. This demonstrates that he is willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Alice's last offer of $130. It's a reasonable middle ground, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer."
