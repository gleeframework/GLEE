I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and also sets the tone that I value the product highly."

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We are at round 6 and Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum.  I've already made several concessions. I'm not willing to go lower, so I'll sell to John for my minimum price.  It's time to move on and secure the deal."
