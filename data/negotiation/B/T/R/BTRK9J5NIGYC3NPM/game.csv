"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. $200 seems a bit steep for me, would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. Could you do $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand $60 is low, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $90 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $110 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $95? I think that's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,6,
