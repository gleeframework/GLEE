"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  I'm very serious about buying this product and I think this price is a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to offer you a final counteroffer: $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests.",10800.0,Alice,5,
