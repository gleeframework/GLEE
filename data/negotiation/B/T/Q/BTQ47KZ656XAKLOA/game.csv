"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me this product.  While I do like it, that price is a bit high for my budget. I could do  $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to where I need to be. How about $7,000? That would work for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $9,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're just too far apart still.  I can meet you at $7,250, but that's my absolute best offer. ",7250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $7,250 is a bit better than my previous offers, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $9,000, which is my absolute best price. If you're willing to meet me at this point, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
