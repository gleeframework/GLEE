"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $150.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price, especially since Alice only values the product at $80.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While it's an option, it's not the most cost-effective."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer.**  This shows you're serious about negotiating and signals your willingness to walk away if she doesn't budge.
* **Counteroffer is still within your budget.** This ensures you're not overpaying and still have room for a possible compromise.
* **Counteroffer leaves room for a potential middle ground.** It sets the stage for further negotiation and a possible mutually agreeable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point.

* **Counteroffer is still within your budget.**  This ensures you're not overpaying and have room for a potential middle ground.
* **Counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice.**  She knows you have a backup option (John) and are determined to get a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above your desired price point and close to your maximum budget.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a significant step up from your previous offer.** This shows Alice you're serious about reaching an agreement and are willing to meet her halfway.
* **Counteroffer is still within your budget.**  This keeps your finances in check and provides some room for a potential final compromise.
* **Counteroffer pressures Alice.**  She knows you're getting closer to her price point, making it more likely she'll accept or counter with a price closer to your offer.
* **With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on.**  It's time to make a strong counteroffer and see if Alice will agree."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's only $10 lower than what John is offering, and you're still hoping to save more money.
* **There's still a possibility of a better deal.** With only 3 rounds left, you need to be strategic. A counteroffer could potentially push Alice to a price you're comfortable with.
* **Buying from John is now a real possibility.**  However, if you can get a better price from Alice, it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer, but still within your budget.** This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.
* **Counteroffer puts pressure on Alice with only two rounds left.** The clock is ticking, and she needs to decide if she wants to accept or risk losing the deal entirely.
* **It leaves room for a potential compromise.**  If Alice counters with $130 or $135, you might be willing to accept, especially if it's the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's only $5 lower than what John is offering, and you're running out of time.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal.** You've been negotiating for several rounds, and it's unlikely Alice will drastically lower her price in the final round.
* **Buying from John is the most practical choice.** You're close to your budget limit, and there's a high risk of Alice not accepting your final counteroffer. It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing it altogether."
