Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to adjust my price if Bob counteroffers, but I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $120 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his initial value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer of $90 is too low and I'm not willing to keep negotiating. John is offering me my minimum value, and I'd rather secure that guaranteed price than risk continuing the negotiation with Bob."
