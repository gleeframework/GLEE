Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This price is higher than my guaranteed minimum of $1,200,000 from John, giving me the potential for a larger profit. 
* I'm taking a risk by offering a higher price, but I'm hoping that Bob values the product enough to pay it. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not losing anything."
