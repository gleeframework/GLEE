# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great value and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm not interested in paying $200. That's way above my budget of $120. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $120.
