Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe it would be highly beneficial to your operations. I'm asking for $1,100,000 for it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, there's always room for negotiation. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Alice to potentially come down while still exceeding her minimum price.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so she's not desperate. This strengthens her position.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message hints at the product's benefits, subtly justifying the high price without revealing John's offer.

**Objective:** Alice aims to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while staying below John's guaranteed offer, maximizing her profit."
