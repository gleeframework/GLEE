Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which is worth a great deal to me. I'm confident it will be just as valuable to you. My initial price is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds and can still negotiate with Bob, or walk away with a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I'll counter Bob's offer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $1,350,000? It's a good compromise and still offers a good value for you. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, and it's a good compromise.  We're now in round 4 out of 10, so I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk a counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower, or to have to sell to John for $1,000,000."
