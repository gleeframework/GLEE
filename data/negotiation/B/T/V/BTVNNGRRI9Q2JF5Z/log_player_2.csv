Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is still below Alice's minimum but closer to her offer. It shows that you are willing to compromise but also want to secure a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you'd ideally like to pay even less, $10,600 is a good compromise. You are within your budget and getting a better price than John's offer.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, so accepting the offer is the best option."
