"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that might convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price range, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, the negotiations might go back and forth for a while.  I'm willing to accept $9,500 at this point to avoid potential risk and secure a decent profit."
