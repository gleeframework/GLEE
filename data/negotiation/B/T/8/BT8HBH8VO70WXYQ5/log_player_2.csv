"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,500.  I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $13,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $11,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,250?  That leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $12,250 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
