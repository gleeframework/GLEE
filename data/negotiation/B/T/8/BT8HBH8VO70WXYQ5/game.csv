"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $11,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,250?  That leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $12,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
