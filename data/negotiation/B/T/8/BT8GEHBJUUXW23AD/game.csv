"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,900?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
