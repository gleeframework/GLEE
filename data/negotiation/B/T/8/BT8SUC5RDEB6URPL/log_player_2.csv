"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can save at least $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. It's likely you can get a better price than $1,400,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves a profit for Alice. Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
