"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $120 for the product. That's a significant discount from your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a significant discount, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go to $140. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but that's still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $130? It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's significantly closer to my budget.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to make a profit on this sale, and $135 is my final offer. Let me know if it's acceptable to you",135.0,Alice,7,
