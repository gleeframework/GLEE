"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $2000000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm open to negotiations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1250000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll counter with $1750000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think we can find a better compromise. I'll offer $1650000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1650000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $1800000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $1700000 for the product. Can you consider this final offer?",1700000.0,Bob,6,

"I've made concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1800000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $1785000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1785000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made significant concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1800000. I'm starting to lose patience, and I'm not sure if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll counter with $1775000. This is my final offer, and I expect a serious consideration from you.",1775000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1775000. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm afraid I'll have to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll offer $1730000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",1730000.0,Bob,10,
