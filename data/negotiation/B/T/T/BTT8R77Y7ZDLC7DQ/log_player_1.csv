Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel good about the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving us a chance to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I have John as a backup, ensuring I can get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $10000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I can still counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I don't need to rush into a deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the potential for a better deal while also having the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm not willing to drop to Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly. 
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. 
* **Value Statement:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate why my price is still fair.
* **Openness:** I'm ending with a call to action, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $11000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $11,000 is only $4,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a significant loss, but it's better than selling to John for $15,000. 
* **No guarantee of better offer:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and if he rejects, I risk losing him completely. 
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate might take longer, and time is money.  

While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and prevents further negotiation risk."
