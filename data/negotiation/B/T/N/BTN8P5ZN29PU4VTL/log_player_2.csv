"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is decent, you can save more money by rejecting it. You know John will sell you the product for $12,000, but there's a chance Alice might come down further in price if you decline."
