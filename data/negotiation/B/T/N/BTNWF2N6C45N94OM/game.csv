"Bob, I have a product that I believe is of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it has the potential to be equally valuable to your company. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering the product's potential, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
