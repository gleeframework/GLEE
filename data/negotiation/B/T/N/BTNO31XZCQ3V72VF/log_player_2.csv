# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You can still save money:** Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000), you're saving $150,000 compared to buying from John."
