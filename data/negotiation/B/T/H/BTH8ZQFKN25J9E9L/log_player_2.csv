"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can still potentially save more money. By rejecting the offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise.  You're essentially offering a price that's halfway between your maximum price ($150) and Alice's minimum price ($100). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is within your acceptable range of $150, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $150. Accepting the offer saves you $25 compared to buying from John.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal, and there's a risk Alice might reject your next counteroffer."
