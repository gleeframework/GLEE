,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to pay this, I'll have to move on to other options.",110.0,Alice,5,
