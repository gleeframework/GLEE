"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price that works for both of us. While I am willing to be flexible,  $725,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we settle at $850,000? That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell which I appreciate.  Could you do $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're absolutely right, we're very close! I'm motivated to get this deal done, but I need the numbers to work for me. Would you be willing to consider $815,000? This reflects my good faith effort to find a middle ground.",815000.0,Alice,7,
