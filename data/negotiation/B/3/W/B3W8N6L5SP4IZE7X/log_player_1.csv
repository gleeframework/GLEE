Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($1,200,000) at $1,100,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains a $300,000 advantage (buying at $1,100,000 what's worth $800,000 to him).
* **First-mover Advantage:** Emphasizing that Bob has a limited-time offer before you go to John adds pressure and might lead to a quicker, more profitable sale."
