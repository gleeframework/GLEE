"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. I understand its worth to you may be substantial, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This price reflects its true potential and represents a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's a limited-time opportunity. If you choose not to proceed, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.
