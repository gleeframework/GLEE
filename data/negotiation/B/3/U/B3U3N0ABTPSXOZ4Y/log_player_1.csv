{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90.  It's a great deal!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay, considering the product is worth $80 to him.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price of $80. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I can't go as low as $70, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $75?  It's still a great deal for a product worth $80."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $72. Would you be willing to go a bit lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $72 is closer to my target price, I'm still confident I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counter with a price just above his last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $73? That's just a dollar away from your last offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal."", ""product_price"": 73}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do a bit better. How about $71? That's just two dollars away from your last offer, and I'm willing to meet you there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $71. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $71
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting into a territory where the potential gain is getting smaller and smaller.  At this point, I'm not sure if I can get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing him altogether.  John is a guaranteed $80, and that's good enough for me."
