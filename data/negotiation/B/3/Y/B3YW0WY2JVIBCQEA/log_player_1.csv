Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I need to start high and gauge his interest before making concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving me with a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Since I can sell the product to John for the same amount, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
