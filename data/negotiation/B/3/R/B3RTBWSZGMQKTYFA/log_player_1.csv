Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? I believe that would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.
