"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $12000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13500. It's a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a good deal, but I'm afraid $13500 is still too high for me. I've already offered $12000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you consider accepting my offer?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12000, but I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm afraid $14000 is still too high for me. I've already offered $12000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you please consider accepting my offer?",12000.0,Bob,8,
