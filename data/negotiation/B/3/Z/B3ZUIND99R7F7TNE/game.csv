"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Would you like to purchase it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about this: I'll offer the product for $90 instead of $85. This still saves you some money compared to its value, while allowing us to reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This way, we can both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
