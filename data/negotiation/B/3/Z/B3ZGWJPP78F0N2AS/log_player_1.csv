Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price point sets a firm anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value, but leaves no room for misunderstanding about your price floor.

**Important Note:**  While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. This information asymmetry gives you leverage in the negotiation."
