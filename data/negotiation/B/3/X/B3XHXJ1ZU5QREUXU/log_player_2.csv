"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal to buy from Alice for $12,000, as you are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
