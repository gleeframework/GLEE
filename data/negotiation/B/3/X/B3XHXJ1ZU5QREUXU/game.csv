"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product to me, but $12,000 is a bit too high. I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering your maximum offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is a small increase from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
