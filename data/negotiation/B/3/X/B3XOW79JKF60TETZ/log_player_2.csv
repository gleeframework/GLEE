"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than the product's value to Alice, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has 10 rounds to negotiate a better price, so it's worth rejecting the initial offer and trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? That would be a fair price considering the value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. While $9,250 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since he has 7 rounds left, it makes sense to keep negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9250 is closer but still a bit high. I'm happy to go up to $9,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500, which I think is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While $9,500 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. He has 5 rounds left and could potentially get a better deal, so it makes sense to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
