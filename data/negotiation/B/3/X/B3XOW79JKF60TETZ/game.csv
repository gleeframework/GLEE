"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? That would be a fair price considering the value to you. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9250 is closer but still a bit high. I'm happy to go up to $9000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500, which I think is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9000. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,
