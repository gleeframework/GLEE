"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can do $110 for the product, which is a great compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can meet you halfway and offer $105. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
