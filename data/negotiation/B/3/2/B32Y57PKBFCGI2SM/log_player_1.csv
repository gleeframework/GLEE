Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a high starting offer, aiming to maximize potential profit. It's a strong opening that gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm confident in the product's value and willing to start high to see where Bob stands.  If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or going with John's guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price point. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop down to $750,000 immediately. I'm confident the product is worth more and will counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This represents a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing me to profit above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is above my guaranteed price from John. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the deal."
