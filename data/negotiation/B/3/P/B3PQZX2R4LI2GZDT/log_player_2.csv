# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000? This is a compromise that reflects the worth of the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still quite a gap from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $16,000? This is my final offer.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so how about $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
