"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product like this, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to you is substantial, and $12,000 falls short of what I can accept. How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
