"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the details. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to accept $100 for the product? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $100. I can sell the product to you for $112.50.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $112.50 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $105? That's a good compromise and closer to what I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $105. I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,7,
