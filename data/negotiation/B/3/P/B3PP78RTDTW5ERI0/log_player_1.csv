Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?
