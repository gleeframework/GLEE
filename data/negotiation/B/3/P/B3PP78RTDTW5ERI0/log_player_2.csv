"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've indicated you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to what I'm willing to pay, but it's still a bit high. I'm going to try to push for a lower price before considering her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is enough to justify the value I place on the product. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's clear she's not willing to budge much further, but I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm truly hoping we can find common ground.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to meet you at $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package, worth $50,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer with the added perks is tempting, it's still above my desired price point. With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a deal with John. Buying from John guarantees me the product within my budget, even if it's not the best price."
