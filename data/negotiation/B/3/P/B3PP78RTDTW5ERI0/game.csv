"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've indicated you're willing to pay.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is enough to justify the value I place on the product. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm truly hoping we can find common ground.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to meet you at $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package, worth $50,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
