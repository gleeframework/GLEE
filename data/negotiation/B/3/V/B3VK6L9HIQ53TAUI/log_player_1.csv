While it's less than hoped for, accepting Bob's offer of $830,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $830,000 is still a significant profit over your minimum ($800,000).
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's offers have consistently stayed in the $800,000 range, suggesting this is close to his maximum. 
* **John as Backup:** Holding out for more risks losing Bob entirely. Accepting now ensures a good deal, whereas John is a reliable fallback at $800,000 if needed in the future."
