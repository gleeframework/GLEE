"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is willing to pay no more than $10,000.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is higher than his maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the value in the product justifies the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still above Bob's limit of $10,000. While there's a chance she might come down further, Bob has a guaranteed deal with John at $10,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially save $800, especially since Bob wants to save as much money as possible."
