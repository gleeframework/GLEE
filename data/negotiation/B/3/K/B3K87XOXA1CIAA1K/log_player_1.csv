Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything under $900,000."
