"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price for a product worth a lot more to me, and I'm sure it's a good deal for you as well. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're working with a budget, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $750,000 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? ",850000.0,Alice,5,
