Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $750,000 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  At this point, it's more strategic to take John's offer of $800,000 and save the extra money."
