Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start negotiations significantly higher. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he's serious, he'll likely counter-offer, opening the door for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" to justify the high price, even though the exact nature of the product is unknown.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  If his counteroffers are too low, you can always walk away knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
