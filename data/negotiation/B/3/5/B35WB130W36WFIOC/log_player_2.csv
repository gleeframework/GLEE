You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, appreciate the offer but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference.  How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, getting the product for $80 from John is a guaranteed better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower than $85."
