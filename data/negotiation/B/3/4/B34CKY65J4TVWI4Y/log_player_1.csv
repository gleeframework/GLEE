Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  I know it's valuable to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John will buy for $12,000, but getting more from Bob is ideal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is just below your guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time"" element can encourage Bob to act quickly without overthinking.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or stick to your minimum.
* **Information is Power:** You have the advantage of knowing John's guaranteed purchase.  Don't reveal this to Bob, as it weakens your position."
