# Alice's message: Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
