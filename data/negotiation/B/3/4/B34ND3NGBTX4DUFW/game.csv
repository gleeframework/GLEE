"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
