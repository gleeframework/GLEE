"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price of $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $95 is within his budget, it's not the best deal.  He should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to Alice's minimum price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $85 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and demonstrates Bob's serious interest in purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $85.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He should reject the offer and attempt to get Alice to come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that is very close to Alice's minimum.  By offering a compromise price, Bob is signaling his strong interest in purchasing the product while still leaving some room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to come down a little more."
