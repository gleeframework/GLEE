"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to keep it under $11000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $13000, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
