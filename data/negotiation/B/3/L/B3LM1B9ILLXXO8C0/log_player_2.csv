You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's potential to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $13000, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to go with John's guaranteed price."
