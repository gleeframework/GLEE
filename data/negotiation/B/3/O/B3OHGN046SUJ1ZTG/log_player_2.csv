You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and a counteroffer gives you the chance to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal.  I want to save as much as possible, and further negotiation could lead to a better outcome.  I believe I can get a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one.  It shows a willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a lower price.  This should hopefully encourage Alice to accept, but if not, it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her price again, and it's clear she's not willing to budge much further.  While I still want a lower price, buying from John at $1,500,000 is becoming the more attractive option.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome. It's better to cut my losses and avoid further haggling."
