Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is only $25,000 below my counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
