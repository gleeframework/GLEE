""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 or more to Bob is unlikely to result in a sale since he values it less. We need to find a price that's attractive to him but also profitable for you.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Letting Bob know there are other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing him to make a decision quicker.

This offer aims to strike a balance between a price Bob might find acceptable (given it's significantly less than your minimum) and a price that still yields a significant profit for you."
