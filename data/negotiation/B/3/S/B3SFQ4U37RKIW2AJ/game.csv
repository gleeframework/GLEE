"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate you taking the time to consider my product. While I understand your budget,  $15000 doesn't quite cover what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Would you be willing to come up a bit to $16500? I think we can make this work for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
