{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I believe it holds great value, and I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a good profit while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $15,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $15,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $1,000 less than my minimum and it's likely that continuing to negotiate with Bob will just lead to more back and forth. It's better to secure the sale now."
