"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $140 is a solid deal. It exceeds Bob's perceived value and provides a reasonable profit margin over my minimum.  There's always a risk Bob might walk away if I push further."
