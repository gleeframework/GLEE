"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,260,000 out of this deal.  That's my final offer.",1260000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1,230,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
