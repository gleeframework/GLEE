Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1,230,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market conditions.

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher, and we are getting into risky territory. Accepting his offer of $1,230,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum."
