Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $11,500 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?

You have three options:

Alice seems unlikely to budge much further. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at $10,000 with John."
