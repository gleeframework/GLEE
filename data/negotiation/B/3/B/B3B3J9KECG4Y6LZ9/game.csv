"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm selling it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000.  Let me know if this is a number we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1600000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1600000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend. Would you consider $1300000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1600000. I can offer you a price of $1450000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
