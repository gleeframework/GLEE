"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, as I believe that reflects its true market value.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $850,000. This product has significant value beyond the market average. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a little hesitant to go to $900,000.  Let's split the difference. How about $875,000?  I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
