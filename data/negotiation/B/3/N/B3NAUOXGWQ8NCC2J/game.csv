"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested in the product but $7,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $6,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",6500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go below $6,500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer it to you for $6,400. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",6400.0,Alice,5,
