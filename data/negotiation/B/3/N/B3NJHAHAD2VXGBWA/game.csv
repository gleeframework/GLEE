"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $16,000 for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
