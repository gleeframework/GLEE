"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1100000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price closer to my maximum budget of $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to a price of $1050000. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum budget of $1000000. Could we possibly reach an agreement at this level?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1025000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose a final offer of $1000000 for the product. I believe this aligns closely with the value I place on it and respects our previous discussions. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
