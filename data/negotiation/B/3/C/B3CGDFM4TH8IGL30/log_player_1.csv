"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While the product is worth $120 to me, I want to start with a high offer to give myself room to negotiate. $180 is high but not ridiculously so, considering Bob values it at $80. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **John as Backup:**  I always have the option of selling to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! $180 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** $60 is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum ($120) and even Bob's perceived value ($80). Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's room to negotiate upwards towards a price that's more acceptable. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'll keep John in mind. If Bob's offers remain unreasonably low, I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. This product is high-quality and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. Could you do $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** I'm lowering my price by $70 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate. However, I'm staying well above his offer to signal my product's value.
* **Approaching My Minimum:** I'm getting closer to my $120 minimum, putting some pressure on Bob to increase his offer significantly if he wants the product.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I want to stay in a position where Bob's counter-offers will be close enough to my minimum to make accepting worthwhile, or give me reason to walk and go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, $80 is still less than my $120 minimum. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** I suspect Bob is willing to pay a bit more than $80 since that's his perceived value. Rejecting this offer will encourage him to improve if he's genuinely interested.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm comfortable rejecting this offer because I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $120 if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and call it $95? That's a pretty significant discount from my original asking price."", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting $95, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's offer. This positions the negotiation as a ""win-win"" scenario.
* **Anchoring to My Advantage:** Even though $95 is a significant drop from my $110 counteroffer, it's still closer to my desired price than Bob's $80. By framing it as a split, I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher number.
* **Urgency and Opportunity:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and time is passing. This offer puts some pressure on Bob to act quickly if he wants the product at a price he finds agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $80.  Would you be willing to go any lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is stuck at $80, and I'm unwilling to go below $95. It seems we've reached an impasse, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob means potentially missing out on a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum acceptable price. With each round, the value of securing a deal with John increases.
* **No More Concessions:** Bob explicitly stated he wants to stay ""closer to $80"", indicating he's unlikely to budge significantly.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
