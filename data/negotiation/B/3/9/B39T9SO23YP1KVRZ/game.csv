"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $750,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $675,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you do $660,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",660000.0,Bob,6,

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.
