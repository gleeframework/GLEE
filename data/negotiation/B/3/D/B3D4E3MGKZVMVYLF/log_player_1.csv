Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you even closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your $100 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down a bit. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John provides a safety net. You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
