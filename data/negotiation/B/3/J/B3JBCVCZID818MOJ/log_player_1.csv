{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good strategy to start high and then be willing to come down slightly if Bob counters.  This will maximize your chances of getting as much money as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $11,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum desired price of $12,000. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial counteroffer and your initial offer. It shows that you are willing to negotiate but are still firm in your desire to get a price closer to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 meets your minimum desired price. Accepting his offer allows you to achieve your goal of getting at least $12,000 for the product."
