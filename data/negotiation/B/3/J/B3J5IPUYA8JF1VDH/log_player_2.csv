Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is far below the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1500000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Please consider this offer carefully.

While Alice has come down in price, $1,500,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's preferred price of $800,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation, but Bob should keep in mind his limit and consider the risk of walking away."
