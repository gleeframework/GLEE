"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is far below the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1500000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Please consider this offer carefully.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
