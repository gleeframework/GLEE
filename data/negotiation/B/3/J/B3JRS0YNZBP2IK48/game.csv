"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150. Let's find a way to make this work!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $117 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm going to stick with $125.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,5,
