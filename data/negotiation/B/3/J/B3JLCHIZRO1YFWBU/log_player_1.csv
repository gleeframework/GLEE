Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price that leaves us both happy. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000,  we start with a higher offer ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. This tactic aims to:
    * **Anchor:** Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
    * **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept a higher price, even if it's above his initial valuation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher by mentioning a public listing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and suggests a willingness to discuss the price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is highly price-sensitive, this initial offer might discourage him. It's important to gauge this during your interactions.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we don't sell below our minimum price.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while maintaining a professional and open dialogue with Bob."
