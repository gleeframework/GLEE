,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product is significant, and I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,800,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good investment.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
