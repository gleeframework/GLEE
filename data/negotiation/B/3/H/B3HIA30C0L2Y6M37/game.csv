"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential to benefit from it.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $850,000? I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value and your potential to benefit from it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $750,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $800,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very fair, and I respect you holding firm on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $775,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  Let's make a deal!",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $825,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I can tell we both want to get this deal done. My final offer is $785,000.  If this works, we have a deal. If not, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",785000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your desperation, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $815,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",815000.0,Alice,9,
