Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this time.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
