Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. It also keeps me significantly above my minimum price of $120, ensuring I don't lose out if Bob rejects and I need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm willing to go down to $100, which is still above my minimum price of $120, and hopefully, this will be more attractive to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum price of $120, but it's getting closer, and further negotiation might take too long. Given the risk of Bob rejecting again or me needing to sell to John, I'll accept his offer and get $95."
