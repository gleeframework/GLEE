"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about we try $10,500? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $10,500 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference - $11,500. I'm sure we can both walk away feeling good about this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $11,500. How about we try $11,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to be under $12,000.",11000.0,Bob,6,
