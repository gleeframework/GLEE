"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get more for the product.  I believe there's room for compromise and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I will send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about we try $10,500? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for that low yet. I believe I can get a higher price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $10,500 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference - $11,500. I'm sure we can both walk away feeling good about this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $11,500. How about we try $11,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to be under $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one!  While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting close to my minimum and I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  I'm accepting his offer and securing a sale."
