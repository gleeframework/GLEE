"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's still a good price for a fantastic product, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still pretty far off from that number though.  How about $75 and we have a deal?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $75 is still too low.  I'm offering $100.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer, but $100 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $87.5?  That's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,6,
