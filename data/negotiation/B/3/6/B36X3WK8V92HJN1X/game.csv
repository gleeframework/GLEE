"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! $120 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $90 right now. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think the product is worth more than $90. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my absolute limit. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer for it eventually. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,4,
