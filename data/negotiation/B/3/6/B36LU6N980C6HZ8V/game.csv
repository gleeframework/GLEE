"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $80?  I'm happy to negotiate further if that's not quite right.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $160? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $140? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",140.0,Alice,5,
