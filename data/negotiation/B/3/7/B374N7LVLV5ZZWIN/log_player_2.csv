"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's start the negotiation from here."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me and the initial price I had in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still well above Bob's budget. Bob is determined to stay within his $8,000 limit, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for the product. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Alice has indicated this is her final compromise, Bob doesn't have any reason to believe she won't continue to ask for more.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000."
