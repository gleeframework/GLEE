"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's start the negotiation from here.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me and the initial price I had in mind.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for the product. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
