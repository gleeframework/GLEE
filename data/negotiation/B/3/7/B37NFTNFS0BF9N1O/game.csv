"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $920000 is still a bit high for my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $860000. This would be a fair price considering the value of the product and our both desire to close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $860000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to help you do that. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $880000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into negotiating. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,7,
