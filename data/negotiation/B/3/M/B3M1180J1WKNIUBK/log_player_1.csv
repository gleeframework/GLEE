Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $100. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's value as possible without risking losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer, and hopefully, it will be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum value of $100, and I'm not sure I can get a better price in the next round. It's also more than what John would pay, so it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer."
