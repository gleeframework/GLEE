"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  While I understand you have a price in mind, I'm confident the product's value warrants a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,350,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
