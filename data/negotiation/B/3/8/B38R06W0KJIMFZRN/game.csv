"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I can't go below $10,000. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase at this price.  Let's close this deal, I'm willing to split the difference from our last offers.",10000.0,Alice,5,
