"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not yet ready to accept such a low price. I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still maintaining a margin that's comfortable for me. We're getting closer to a potential deal, and I hope Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiations with Bob haven't reached my minimum acceptable price.  I've already lowered my price considerably, and it seems Bob is not willing to come up much further.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for the guaranteed price of $1,500,000. This ensures I get a fair return and avoids further risk of potentially ending up with a lower price."
