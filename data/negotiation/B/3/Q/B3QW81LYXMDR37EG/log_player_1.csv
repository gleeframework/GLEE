Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, the product's value is significantly higher than $900,000. Let's settle at $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to the product's value to me. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a fair deal, and further negotiation with Bob might not yield a much better outcome."
