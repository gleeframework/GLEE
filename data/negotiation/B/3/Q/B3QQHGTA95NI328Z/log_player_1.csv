Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $110 is too low for me, considering it's worth $120 to me. I'll see if I can get closer to my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $120 for the product.  That's fair to both of us, and it's the final offer I'm willing to make."", ""product_price"": 120}
