Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. She has a guaranteed sale at that price with John, so she shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.

**The Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing to Bob but still profitable for her.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Why this works:**

* **High but Negotiable:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. It signals that Alice knows the product's worth.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning it will be ""available elsewhere"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Profitable for Alice:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to make significantly more than her guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
