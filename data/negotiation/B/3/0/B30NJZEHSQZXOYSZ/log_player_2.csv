Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go a bit further and meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and save the extra money."
