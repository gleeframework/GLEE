"Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential. I'm thinking $15000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. If you're not interested, I'm happy to sell it to someone else for $10000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
