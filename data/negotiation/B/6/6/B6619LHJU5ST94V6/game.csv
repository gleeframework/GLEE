"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is high quality, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I would be willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and quality.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000 yet. I can see that you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, so I'm willing to make another concession. My counteroffer is $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you again for working with me.  I understand this product is valuable to you and you want to make sure you are getting a fair price.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer $775,000.  I believe that is a very fair offer and close to your previous offer.  Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to have a productive conversation. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My counteroffer is $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",825000.0,Alice,7,
