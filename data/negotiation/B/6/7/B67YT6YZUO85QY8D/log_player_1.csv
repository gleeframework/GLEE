Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **The John Factor:** While you have a backup buyer, aiming higher with Bob first is strategically sound. 

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
