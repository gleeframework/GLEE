"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it at a lower price than you value it and I'll still make a good profit.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.** Buying from Alice for $12,000 saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **While Alice makes a profit, Bob still gets a good deal.**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so buying it for $12,000 is a significant saving."
