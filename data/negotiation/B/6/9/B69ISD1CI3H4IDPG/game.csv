"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let me think for a moment... Ah, I can do $95. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going all the way to $90. I can do $92, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
