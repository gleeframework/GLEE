"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget considerations, I am able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and drop the price to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to meet me halfway on this final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in making this deal happen. I am willing to consider your latest offer of $1,075,000. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable given the value of the product to me. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
