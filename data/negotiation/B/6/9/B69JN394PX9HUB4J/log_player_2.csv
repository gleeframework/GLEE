Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a solution.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and drop the price to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to meet me halfway on this final offer.
