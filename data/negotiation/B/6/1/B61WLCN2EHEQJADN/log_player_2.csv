"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a significantly lower price.  I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you.  Would you be interested in acquiring it for $900000? This is a limited-time offer, and I have another buyer ready to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
