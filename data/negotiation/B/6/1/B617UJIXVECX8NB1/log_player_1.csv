Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You need to make at least $150 from the sale, so that's your baseline.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob declines.

**Strategy:**

Offering the product at $140 aims to maximize profit while still being enticing to Bob:

* **Profitable for You:**  It's above your minimum price, netting you a $10 profit over your alternative sale.
* **Potentially Appealing to Bob:**  It's a $20 discount from your backup offer, potentially making it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
