"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $10,000, making it likely he'll consider the offer. However, it also leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately giving away too much of the potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than John's offer of $8,000, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $9,500, showing flexibility to Bob. It's still above my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but it's getting closer to a potentially acceptable deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,200 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  However, it's significantly better than John's offer. It's worth rejecting and seeing if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $8,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $8,200 and my desired price of $8,750.  I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about making a deal, but also leaving a small margin for potential further negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's still not ideal, but with only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing out to John (or Bob rejecting further offers) is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit."
