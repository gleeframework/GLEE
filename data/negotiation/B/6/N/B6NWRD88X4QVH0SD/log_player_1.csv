Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a fair price, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and Bob's estimated value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still making a decent profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to respond, leaving the door open for further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved my goal of earning a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a new offer closer to my minimum.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for that right now. I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has already shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's a chance I can get him to pay closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's low offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price, potentially $9,000 or $9,500, emphasizing the product's value and leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential return on investment. 
* **Open for Further Discussion:**  I'm ending the message with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my target.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and John's offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum of $8,000, but it's still not quite there. I'm not desperate to sell and can hold out for a slightly better deal.
* **Room for one more counteroffer:**  I still have room to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.  A small concession from Bob could bring us to a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's offer is the fallback:**  If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob, likely in the range of $8,800 to $9,000,  explaining that this is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget. I'm willing to make one final concession.  My absolute lowest price is $8,800.  This is a very fair offer considering the product's value to you. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. "", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider accepting.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm once again reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm communicating my willingness to walk away if we can't agree, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a price that's within my desired range and a good outcome for both of us.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll immediately accept John's offer of $8,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure I don't lose out on the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 above my minimum, and I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's so close to my bottom line. I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk getting a very low price.
* **Negotiations Stalled:**  We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $8,000 is guaranteed, and it's a reasonable price for the product. There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:** By selling to John, I guarantee a sale at a price that's acceptable to me. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting a worse deal."
