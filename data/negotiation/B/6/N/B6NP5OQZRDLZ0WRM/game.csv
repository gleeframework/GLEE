,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. How about we meet somewhere closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I can go up to $7,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price.  How about $7,500?  That's a fair offer, and it avoids wasting more time in negotiation.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my price, but I'm still not sure $7,500 is enough. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my next move. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,7,
