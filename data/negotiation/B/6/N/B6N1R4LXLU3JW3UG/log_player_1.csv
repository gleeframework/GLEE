Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm motivated to sell, $11,000 is below its value to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and any further negotiation risks losing the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's time to cut bait and secure the sure profit."
