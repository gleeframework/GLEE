"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) and leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more, but also leaves space for Bob to counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm interested in selling, I'm not willing to take such a big loss. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on a fantastic product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still a loss for me. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to go down to $135. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'm still not there yet. I'd be willing to meet you at $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm running out of rounds and the risk of losing money is increasing. To ensure I don't end up with a loss, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. This will guarantee me the minimum profit I'm looking for."
