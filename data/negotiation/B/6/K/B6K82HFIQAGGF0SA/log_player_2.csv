"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows for some profit for you as well. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which still leaves some room for profit for you. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While there is still some room for negotiation, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking a further price increase or running out of rounds."
