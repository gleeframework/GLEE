"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than buying from John, you can potentially get a better deal. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get closer to that $80 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between Alice's value of $80 and my maximum of $100. This is a fair compromise that gives Alice a decent profit margin while still saving me money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is closer to my target price of $80. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or increase the price again.  It's a good deal for me and saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
