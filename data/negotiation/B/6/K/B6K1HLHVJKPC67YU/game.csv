"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above your value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm comfortable paying $875,000 for the product. This price is a good compromise for both of us and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,5,
