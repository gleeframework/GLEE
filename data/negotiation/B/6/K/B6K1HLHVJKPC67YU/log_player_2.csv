Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.
