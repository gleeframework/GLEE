Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above your value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.
