"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice is willing to go lower, and you have 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to lower the price by $10. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a reasonable range considering my maximum budget of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  $90 is a good deal, and while I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $120 outweighs the potential savings."
