(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Exploring options:**  Rejecting allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  It's a halfway point between Alice's desired price and your maximum budget. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will allow you to assess Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:** Alice's offer is within your budget of $1,200,000 and is a much better deal than John's offer.
* **Small negotiation window:** You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice has countered. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more savings.
* **Time factor:** It's early in the negotiation process, and accepting the offer allows you to secure the product without risking further negotiation rounds that might lead to a deadlock or a worse deal."
