"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would allow you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is my last offer before considering other options.",980000.0,Alice,5,
