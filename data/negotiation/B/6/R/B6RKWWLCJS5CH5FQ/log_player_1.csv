{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where both parties have room to maneuver.  It's above my minimum value of $800,000 but leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $950,000 is still a good deal and a significant improvement over selling to John.  Bob's offer is my final offer, and I'm happy to accept it."
