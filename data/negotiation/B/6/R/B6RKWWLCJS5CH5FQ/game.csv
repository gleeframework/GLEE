"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow me to move forward with the sale.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
