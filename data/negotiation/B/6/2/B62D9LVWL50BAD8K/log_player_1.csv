Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($120), giving me some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for you to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from him. Accepting ensures I get the maximum value from Bob without risking a prolonged negotiation that could lead to me selling to John for the same price."
