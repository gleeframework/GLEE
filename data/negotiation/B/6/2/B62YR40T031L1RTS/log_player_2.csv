Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price higher than your maximum but still significantly lower than Alice's offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and although it's getting closer, you're not sure if you'll be able to negotiate any lower. It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
