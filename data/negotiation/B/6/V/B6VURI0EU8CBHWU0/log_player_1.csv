Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,250,000 falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this price represents a win-win for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and gives us both a good outcome. Let's try to find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting $1,300,000 is a good deal. It's significantly more than Bob initially offered and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
