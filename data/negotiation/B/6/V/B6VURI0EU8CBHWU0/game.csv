"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I believe it holds immense potential, even beyond its current market value. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,250,000 falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this price represents a win-win for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and gives us both a good outcome. Let's try to find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
