"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, which is slightly above the value I know the product has for me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Optimistic tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, aiming to build a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Offering value:** I emphasize the potential value the product holds for Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the door open for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking for a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and Bob's offer of $95 is below that.
* **Potential for a better price:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I might be able to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net, giving me leverage to be more assertive with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to potentially get a higher price from Bob or, if unsuccessful, fall back on the guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit margin:** $102.50 still allows me to make a decent profit while being more competitive with Bob's offer.
* **Open communication:**  My message is friendly and acknowledges Bob's position, aiming to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, potentially leading to a deal while still protecting my minimum profit requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $97.50 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $97.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to sell for a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price range. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have John's offer of $100 as a backup, giving me the confidence to hold out for a more favorable price from Bob.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal while maintaining the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. Would you consider $100? This is the absolute minimum I can go, but it's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum price point of $100, but emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a ""great deal"" for Bob.
* **Direct and concise:**  My message is clear and to the point, avoiding further haggling.
* **Finality:** I'm subtly signaling that this is my final offer, hoping to prompt Bob to make a decision.

By offering $100, I'm maintaining my minimum profit while leaving the door open for a possible deal with Bob. If he rejects, I can confidently move on to John's offer."
