Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150. I know Bob values the product at $120, so this price is a bit of a stretch, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to lower my price a bit, but I'll still aim to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum value of $150, so I'm happy to accept it. It's better than selling to John for $150, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
