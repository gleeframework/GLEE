"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm asking $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I think you would be the ideal owner.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
