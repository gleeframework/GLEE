{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, knowing Bob values it at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The $12,000 price point allows for a few counteroffers before I reach my minimum of $15,000 from John. 

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my target price.  
* **John's Offer:**  John is a backup option and will guarantee my minimum desired price, making it risky to accept Bob's offer now. 

I'll counter Bob's offer, but I'll be firm in trying to get a price closer to my $12,000 initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that's a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $10,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.

I'm hoping this counter-offer will be more enticing to Bob while still keeping me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can we meet at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While $10,000 is still below my initial goal of $12,000, it's closer than Bob's previous offers. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, delaying the sale and potentially causing me to lose time and opportunity.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is a safety net, but I don't want to risk losing a sale to a potential buyer who might be willing to negotiate further.

Accepting Bob's offer of $10,000 is the best option at this point. It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale quickly while minimizing the risk of losing potential profits."
