"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which still leaves you with a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,275,000.  This product represents a unique opportunity, and I believe this is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
