"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is reflective of its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price better reflects the value you'll gain from this product in the long run.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our valuations. To be completely honest, anything above $700,000 is pushing it for me.  If you can get closer to that range, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm very motivated to sell this product, and I value your interest. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000? I believe this price represents a significant concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly more than I'm comfortable with.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to close. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider my alternative.",750000.0,Bob,6,
