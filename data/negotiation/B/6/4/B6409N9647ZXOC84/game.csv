"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe the product is worth it to me, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a more favorable price. While I value your interest, the true value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
