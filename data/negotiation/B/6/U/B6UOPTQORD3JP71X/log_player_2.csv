Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's preferred price point, but it's a step in the right direction.  Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  There's still room for a deal without going to John."
