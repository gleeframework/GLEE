,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go a bit higher.  Let's try $1,100,000.  This price is closer to what I feel is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a good return on investment. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,110,000.  This is a fair compromise and I believe we can finalize this deal.",1110000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is as low as I can go without compromising the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
