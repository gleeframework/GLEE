Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price."
