Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, and I'm looking for a price around $25,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While $15,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $20,000 is still beyond my budget. Would you consider $17,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $17,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and further negotiation might not yield much better results.
