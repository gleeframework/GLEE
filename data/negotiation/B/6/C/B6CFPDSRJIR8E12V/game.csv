"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $140.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? This is a fair price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Bob,4,
