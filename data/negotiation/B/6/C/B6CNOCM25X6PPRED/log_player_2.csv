"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $12,000. Offering $13,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $14,000, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,500 is still higher than Bob's preferred price point. While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob is still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's still a chance that Alice might be willing to lower her offer further to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $13,000 and Alice's current offer of $14,500.  $13,500 is a reasonable compromise that could potentially appeal to Alice, especially if she wants to avoid selling to John for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is the same price that John is offering.  At this point, Bob is no longer gaining any advantage by negotiating with Alice.  He has reached his maximum price point and would be better off buying the product from John, as there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a lower price."
