"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in this product, but I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is closer to Bob's desired price, $11,500 is still above his $10,000 limit.  He has more room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can manage. I'm very serious about purchasing this product, but I'm limited to a budget of $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and Alice's offer is still above his $10,000 limit. While it's getting closer, he's not desperate and can continue negotiating. There's still potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at my budget of $10,000.  Would you consider a final price of $10,250? That would allow me to get the product and still stay within my limits."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to take a slightly firmer stance. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit. There's still a chance to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal. Also, Bob has the option of purchasing from John for $10,000, making him less pressured to accept an offer that's still over his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still very close to my budget. $10,800 is tempting, but I can only stretch to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10700.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time, with only one round remaining. Alice's final offer of $10,700 is still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John. Even though he won't get the absolute lowest price, it's the safest option to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
