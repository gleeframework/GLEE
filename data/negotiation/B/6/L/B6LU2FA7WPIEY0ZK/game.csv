"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in this product, but I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. I'm confident you'll love it.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit more than I can manage. I'm very serious about purchasing this product, but I'm limited to a budget of $10000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.  $11000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at my budget of $10000.  Would you consider a final price of $10250? That would allow me to get the product and still stay within my limits.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to take a slightly firmer stance. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still very close to my budget. $10800 is tempting, but I can only stretch to $10500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10700. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10700.0,Alice,9,
