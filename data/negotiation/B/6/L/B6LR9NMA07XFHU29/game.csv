"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm happy to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're willing to come up a bit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This price represents a significant value for you, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
