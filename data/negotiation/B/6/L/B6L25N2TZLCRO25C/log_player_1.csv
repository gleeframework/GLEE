"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure $1150000 is the right price. Considering my maximum budget and the potential for negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While I understand your budget constraints, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant concession on my end. This price ensures a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to maximize the value of your investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
