"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is $110.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we settle on $115?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you get from this product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to be fair here, but $115 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference at $112.50?  It's a good deal for both of us.",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet at $113.75? It's a very slight adjustment from your offer, and it gets us both closer to a deal.  I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price.",113.75,Alice,7,
