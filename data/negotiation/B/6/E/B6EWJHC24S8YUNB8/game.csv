"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is unfortunately well above what I'm able to spend at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a very fair price considering its value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This price is still within a fair range considering the value of the product and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
