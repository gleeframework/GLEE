"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $102.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more, $95 is a decent price and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  I'd rather take $95 now than risk getting nothing or having to sell to John for $100."
