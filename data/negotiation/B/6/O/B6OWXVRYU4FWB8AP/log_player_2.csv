# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $10,000. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it brings, I believe this is an opportunity not to be missed. I kindly invite you to accept this offer at the same value, ensuring both parties benefit from this transaction. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Alice is also willing to sell the product for $10,000.  This means there is no room for negotiation.  Since John is also willing to sell the product for the same price, there is no benefit to buying from Alice. Rejecting her offer means you'll buy from John, and the outcome is the same."
