"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do this for a much lower price. How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but $60 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $120 to make it worth my while.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $120 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, considering its condition.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $110 to make it worth my while.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $110 is still a bit too high. How about we settle at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $80 is actually below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need at least $130 to make it worth my while.",130.0,Alice,7,
