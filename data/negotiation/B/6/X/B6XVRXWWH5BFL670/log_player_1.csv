Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim high with Bob.  
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than you do or is willing to pay a premium for exclusivity. A starting price of $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" to justify the high price and project confidence in your offer. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can always lower your price, but you can't go higher once the offer is made."
