Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If this still doesn't work for you, I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think?
