Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $95. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hopeful this will be enough to reach an agreement, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects my offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and it seems like he's not willing to go much higher. It's better to take the $90 now and avoid further negotiation that might result in a longer process or an even lower offer from Bob."
