"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is more than your maximum budget of $150, and you want to save as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.

**Next steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $110 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more savings:** While you could try to negotiate further, it's possible Alice will stand firm at $110. 
* **The risk of losing the deal:** If you reject and try to negotiate further, you risk Alice getting impatient and deciding to sell to someone else, or you might end up paying John's higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer of $110 is the best option to secure the product while staying within your budget and minimizing risk."
