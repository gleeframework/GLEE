Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point because it:

* **Shows confidence:**  A higher initial offer suggests you believe in the product's value. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum ($80) but leaves space for Bob to bargain. 
* **Opens the conversation:** The message invites Bob to respond and provides an opportunity for him to explain his perspective. 

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while remaining open to negotiation and ensuring that you don't lose the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your ideal price.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you a chance to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
