"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $750,000 is a good price, there is still room for negotiation. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  There are 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $725000, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $700,000. While Alice has moved closer to his initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  He can continue to try and get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer.  There are still 7 rounds remaining to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $712,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 712500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725000 and $712500, which is $718750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $718,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $718,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has been negotiating for a few rounds and has gotten the price down to $718,750. This is significantly less than his initial budget and is only $18,750 more than his last counteroffer.  He's nearing the point where he might have to buy from John, which would cost him $80,000 more.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of a higher price from John."
