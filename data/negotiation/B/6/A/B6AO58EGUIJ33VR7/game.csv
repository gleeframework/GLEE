"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider my offer?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe that the product's value is higher than $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to counteroffer at $700000. This price takes into account the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your counteroffer, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $700000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I'll have to go down to $650000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to compromise further. Can you consider my new offer?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go below $750000. I think this is the minimum price I can accept for the product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $725000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
