Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $100 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but potentially attractive enough to consider, especially if the product offers unique benefits.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the goal is to maximize profit, starting at $120 (your minimum) might be too aggressive and lead to an immediate rejection. Offering $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to still reach a price above your minimum. 
* **Considering the Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob, as you're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
