""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He knows you're serious about selling, and you might be able to settle on a price between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000."
