,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your eagerness to close the deal, but $1,050,000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this product. I believe this is our final offer before we consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I've done my research and I'm confident that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at this price, and I'd like to move forward with the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
