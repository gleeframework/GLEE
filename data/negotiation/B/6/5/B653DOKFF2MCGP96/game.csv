"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but $11,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, $9,750 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10,000 is as high as I can go.  If you're firm at $10,250, I might have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
