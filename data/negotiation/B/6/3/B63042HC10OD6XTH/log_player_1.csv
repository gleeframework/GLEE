"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for potential compromise. It also includes a friendly opening message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $80 from John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I want to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob.  There's a good chance Bob is willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a little higher.  How about $95?  I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $95 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
