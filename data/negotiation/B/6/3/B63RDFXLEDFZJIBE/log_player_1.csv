Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm happy to offer it for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $2,000,000 gives you significant room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial high price will be telling. If he's immediately put off, you know he's highly price-sensitive. If he counters, you can gauge how much he truly values the product.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to earn as much as possible. While there's a risk Bob will reject the offer, the potential reward of a $2,000,000 sale outweighs the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John in this scenario."
