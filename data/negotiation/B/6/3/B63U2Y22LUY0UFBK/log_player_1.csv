{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While I could start higher, demanding a price too close to $12,000 might make Bob walk away, even if he values it that highly.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** $11,500 is significantly more than my backup offer from John ($10,000).

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
