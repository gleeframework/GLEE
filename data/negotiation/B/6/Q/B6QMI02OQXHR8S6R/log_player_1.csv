"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to capture a large portion of potential surplus value. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still aiming for a price above my minimum acceptable price. I believe $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is still lower than my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also not sure how much more negotiation power I have, as we're already in round 4. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a good option, but it's not a guarantee that we'll be able to close the deal with him. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale, and I can always try to make up for the lower price in future deals."
