"Alice, while I appreciate the product, $20,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. This reflects the value I place on it, and is my maximum offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is closer to the product's true value.  I could meet you halfway at $16,000.  This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,
