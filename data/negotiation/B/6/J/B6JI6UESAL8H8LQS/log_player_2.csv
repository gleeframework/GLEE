"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

$20,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay.  It makes sense to reject the offer and counter."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is closer to the product's true value.  I could meet you halfway at $16,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He's best off rejecting the offer and countering again."
