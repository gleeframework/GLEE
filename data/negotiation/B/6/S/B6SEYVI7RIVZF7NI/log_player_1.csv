Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,775,000 for the product.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially squeeze a bit more from Bob, his ""final offer"" language suggests he may be reaching his limit. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($275,000 above John's offer) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
