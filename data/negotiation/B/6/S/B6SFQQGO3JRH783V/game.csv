"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget,  $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. Would you consider $11000? It's still a great deal, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10500? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. While $10500 is a fair price,  I'm still not quite there yet.  Would you consider $12000?  This price reflects the value of the product and is also a significant step towards meeting your budget.  Let's make this deal happen quickly!",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still trying to get the price you want, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $10500. Would you consider $11250? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on this price.",11250.0,Bob,6,
