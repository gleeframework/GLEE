"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $85. Let me know if you're willing to come down to that.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to consider $90 as a fair price for the product.

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $88? I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",88.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $89 is a great offer.  However,  I'm still hoping to get it for $85. I'm confident we can find a happy middle ground, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can make it work.",85.0,Bob,8,
