"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value it will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $990,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",990000.0,Alice,5,
