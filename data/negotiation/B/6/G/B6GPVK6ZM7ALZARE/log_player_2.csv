Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your highest offer at this time. However, I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $950000 is a bit below the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support, which will add significant value to the product.
