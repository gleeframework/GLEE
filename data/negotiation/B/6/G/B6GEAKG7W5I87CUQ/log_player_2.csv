"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is because:

* Alice's offer is $15,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You want to save as much money as possible. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is only $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget:**  While it's lower than her initial price, $13,000 is still more than your $10,000 limit.
* **John's offer is the best option:** You've already established that John is selling the product for your maximum price. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice if you can get it cheaper from John."
