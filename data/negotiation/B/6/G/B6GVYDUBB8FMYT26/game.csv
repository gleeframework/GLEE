"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price. Would you consider lowering the price closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this brings.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline at $1,700,000. My budget remains fixed at $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another adjustment. How about $1,550,000? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm grateful for your continued flexibility. However, I'm still unable to meet the $1,550,000 price point. Given my budgetary constraints, I believe we've reached the limit of what I can reasonably offer. I would like to propose one final price of $1,300,000. I hope this proposal is within a range that might allow us to conclude this transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
