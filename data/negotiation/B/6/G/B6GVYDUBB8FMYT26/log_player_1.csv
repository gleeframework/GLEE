Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price. Would you consider lowering the price closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm grateful for your continued flexibility. However, I'm still unable to meet the $1,550,000 price point. Given my budgetary constraints, I believe we've reached the limit of what I can reasonably offer. I would like to propose one final price of $1,300,000. I hope this proposal is within a range that might allow us to conclude this transaction.

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll move much beyond his $1,300,000 offer. Accepting that offer would still mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer.  It makes more business sense to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
