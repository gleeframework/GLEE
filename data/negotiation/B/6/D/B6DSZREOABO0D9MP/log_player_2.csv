"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same as the price you'd pay John, there's no reason to reject. Accepting gets you the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay."
