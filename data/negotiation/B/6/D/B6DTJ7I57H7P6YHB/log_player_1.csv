Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $9,000. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, and still gives me a profit. If he rejects, I can still fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum, and I don't want to settle for that. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm happy to secure the $8,000 from John rather than risk losing more money trying to negotiate further with Bob."
