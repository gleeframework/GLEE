Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something worth a lot to you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I'm confident in finding another buyer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Offering $900,000 is still within Bob's valuation of $800,000, leaving him with potential profit.
* **My Value:** This price allows me to gain a significant amount while still securing a better deal than selling to John.
* **Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This approach assumes that the product's value to Bob is relatively stable and he won't be driven by a strong desire to bargain down significantly.
* The final price will depend on the specific product and Bob's negotiation skills."
