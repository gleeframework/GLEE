Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's valuation of $150, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll also be prepared to move on to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to get it for a bit lower. How about $130?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer, it's likely that Bob will be firm at $130.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
