"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $120, but wants to start with a reasonable offer that shows he's willing to negotiate.  $90 is a good starting point, giving Alice room to counter without exceeding Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is still above Bob's desired price point, but it's closer to his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his goal of saving money.  He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but staying within his budget.  This offer gives Alice some room to counter, but also puts pressure on her to accept, as Bob has shown he's not willing to pay her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it still leaves room for negotiation. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to meet Alice halfway, offering $100. This is a significant compromise, but it's still within Bob's budget and represents a good potential deal for both parties.  Alice is likely to see this as a reasonable offer, especially with limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still not ideal.  With only 3 rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might come down further in order to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his strategy of slowly increasing his offer, showing he's serious about the deal but still seeking the best price.  $105 is a strong middle ground, and with only two rounds left, Alice might be more inclined to accept to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation. Alice has rejected Bob's previous offer, and her counter-offer of $110 is still higher than what Bob is aiming for.  With only one round remaining, the chances of reaching a deal are slim.  Buying from John for $120, while not ideal, guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of failing to negotiate a deal with Alice."
