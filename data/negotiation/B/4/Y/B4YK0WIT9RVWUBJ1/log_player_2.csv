"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $9,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. 
* It's likely Alice is willing to go lower than $9,000.
* It's always good to explore options before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it's not an unreasonable starting point.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Alice some space to counter back without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Focus on value:** By starting at $7,000, I'm setting the stage for a negotiation based on what *I* perceive the product's value to be, not just Alice's starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress towards a deal:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $8,500 is a good middle ground and a significant saving compared to John's price. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 7 rounds left, accepting now avoids the risk of a longer negotiation leading to a worse outcome."
