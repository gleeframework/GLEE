"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1200000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product for $1350000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1250000 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $1300000? This is very close to my minimum, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this valuable product. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other offers.  Let me know your decision.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
