Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
