"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'm more comfortable in the $6,000 range. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,250, which would be $7,875. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",7875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $7,875 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $7,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you halfway between $7,875 and $7,500, which would be $7,687.50. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",7687.5,Alice,7,
