"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $10500 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can we discuss further?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $11000. That's a significant step closer to my initial offer, and I think it reflects the value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and commitment to reaching a deal. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $11000? It's a fair price that respects both our needs, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already gone up to $10500 and you're still not willing to meet me there. I'm starting to lose interest in this deal. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10250. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10250.0,Bob,8,
