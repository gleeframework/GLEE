"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm not aiming for the full $15,000 right away, as that's likely to be rejected. This price gives Bob some wiggle room to counter.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate upward, as Bob has indicated an interest in the product. 
* **Value of Time:**  I'm not in a rush. By rejecting this offer, I can explore if I can get a better price from Bob or potentially move to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting him halfway. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I'm framing it as a fair price for both of us, appealing to his sense of reason.
* **Still above my minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $10500 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $10,000 is still below my desired minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** Bob is willing to negotiate further, indicating he still wants the product. 
* **Potential for Better Price:** I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price, possibly closer to my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Value of Time:** I'm not in a rush to sell and can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $11,000. That's a significant step closer to my initial offer, and I think it reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm raising the offer slightly, showing I'm willing to budge, but not drastically. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""value"" of the product to justify the price point. 
* **Setting the Stage:** I'm positioning this offer as a potential closing point, making it seem like a good deal for both parties. 
* **Balancing Act:** I'm still maintaining some distance from my minimum to potentially negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $10,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate further. There's potential to push for a higher price.
* **Risk of Loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but I don't want to miss out on potentially getting closer to my initial offer of $12,000 with Bob.
* **Time is on my side:** With several rounds remaining, I have time to see if Bob will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and commitment to reaching a deal. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair price that respects both our needs, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not going below my initial offer of $11,000.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product to justify the price point.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm framing this as a ""fair price that respects both our needs,"" implying that if we don't reach an agreement, it might not happen. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm trying to capitalize on Bob's increasing willingness to pay.  I believe there's a good chance he'll accept this offer, and $11,000 is still a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already gone up to $10500 and you're still not willing to meet me there. I'm starting to lose interest in this deal. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10250. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the pressure is mounting.
* **Falling Price:** Bob's offer keeps decreasing, indicating he's less interested and likely won't budge much further. 
* **Significant Loss:**  $10,250 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000, making this offer financially unattractive.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $15,000, which is more than what I'm likely to get from Bob in the remaining rounds.

While I would like to get a better price,  I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale over potentially losing a deal and getting an even lower price from Bob."
