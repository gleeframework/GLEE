# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $119, while John would sell it to you for $120. 
* **You want to save money:** Even though the product is worth $120 to you, you can get it for less from Alice. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
