"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit below that. How about $8,750? I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $8,900? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below $8,900. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but I want to be honest with you, I'm also considering buying the product from another seller who is offering it to me for $8,000. I'd rather do business with you, but I need to make a decision soon. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
