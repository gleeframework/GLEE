"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see that we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, $10,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,800.
