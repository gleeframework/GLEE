"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $60. I can do $120, though. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product Alice, but $120 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. How about we try $110? It's a bit more than your offer, but still a good deal for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
