Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but leaves some room for negotiation.  This strategy allows for potential back-and-forth without immediately resorting to selling to John.  If Bob rejects, we can then adjust our offer based on his counter-offer, trying to maximize our profit while keeping in mind John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We are aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to our valuation, we still have some room to negotiate upwards.  By rejecting and counter-offering, we have the opportunity to potentially earn a higher price.  We can evaluate Bob's counteroffer and see if there is a potential for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

We're moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above his valuation. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to our ideal. The goal is to find a middle ground that both parties can accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now lower than our minimum valuation.  We have reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that satisfies our minimum. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum value, which is more appealing than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
