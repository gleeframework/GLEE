"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is a bit below where I need to be. How about we split the difference and meet at $1350000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1350000. How about we meet at $1250000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product if the price is right.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $1250000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference once more. I'm willing to accept $1300000. This is a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more flexibility. How about we try $1225000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the effort you're putting into finding a solution.  While I understand your position, $1225000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I need to be closer to $1300000. How about we try $1275000?  It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a chance to get this valuable product at a price that's still within your budget.",1275000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1275000. How about we try $1200000 one more time? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product if the price is right.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
