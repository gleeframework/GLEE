"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always best to try to negotiate a lower price.  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. You can counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product,  $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're open to that price, we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you, Bob, that I won't sell the product for less than $825000. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'll come down to $820000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on her price, and while $820,000 is closer to your budget, it's still not within your goal of saving as much money as possible.  You can get the product from John for your target price of $800,000. It's a better deal to buy from John."
