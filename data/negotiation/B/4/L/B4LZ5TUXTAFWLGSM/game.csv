"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $925,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $737,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",737500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of what this product can do for your business.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000.  This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
