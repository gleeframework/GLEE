**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,000,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it remains a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I will try to negotiate further to get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to avoid losing the deal altogether."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While there's a chance she might come down further, I've already made several counteroffers and it's possible the negotiation could go on for a long time.  To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'm going to buy it from John for $800,000."
