$100 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this is a more appealing price for Bob and we can reach a deal."

Bob's offer is now below my minimum price, and I've already reached the point where I'm willing to accept John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
