"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and see how much I can get before moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$13,000 is too low for me. I'm going to counter and try to get closer to my desired price. If Bob still won't budge, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$14,500 is close, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'll counter again and see if Bob is willing to budge further. If not, I'll have to decide if the risk of continuing is worth it or if I should take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm coming down a bit further, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This offer is only $500 less than what John is offering, so I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, but I've already gone through several rounds and it's unlikely he'll go higher. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  He's offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is the same as Bob's offer."
