"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm looking to get a price that reflects its worth. How about we start at $130?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards your $150 maximum."
