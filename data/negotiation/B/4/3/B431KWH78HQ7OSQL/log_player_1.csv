Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly closer to his perceived value than mine. While I could counter, there's a risk he walks away.  It's time to secure a good deal.
