"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $110.  This is a strategy to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $80 to him, he might be willing to pay a little more, but I'm setting the bar high to see where he stands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), I think I can still push for a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $100. This is my absolute minimum. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're getting close to a deal and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob has consistently rejected offers above his stated value, and I'm running out of time and bargaining leverage. While I'd ideally get $105, John's offer guarantees my minimum desired price, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
