"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $10,000. Would you be willing to do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $10,250? That's a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000. This is the highest I can go, as I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
