"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can we meet in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $90 and $80. I'll sell the product to you for $85.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $82.5, but that's my final offer",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $82.5 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll meet you halfway between $85 and $82.5. I'll sell the product to you for $83.75.",83.75,Alice,5,
