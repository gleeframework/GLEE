"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very competitive price of $900,000.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Please consider my offer carefully, as I'm confident you'll find it to be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount from what the product is worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option."
