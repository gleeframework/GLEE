"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for you, but the product's value to you is worth it.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.  Let's make it happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I believe this is a win-win situation, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of this deal. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a little more than I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. This offer is within my budget and should allow you to reach your desired price.
