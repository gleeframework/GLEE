We look forward to discussing the details and potentially bringing this exceptional product into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000). 
* **Rejecting gives Bob negotiating power.** By rejecting, Bob signals that he's not desperate and might be willing to walk away. This could potentially lead Alice to make a more attractive offer in the future.
* **Buying from John is the worst-case scenario.** While it's more expensive, it's still within Bob's budget. But, Bob should try to leverage the potential of John's offer to get a better deal from Alice."
