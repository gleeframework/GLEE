"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $7,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can save up to $1,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $6,800. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $6,800 is a good deal for you. You've already saved $1,200 compared to John's price, and further negotiation might not yield a significant enough price reduction to justify the risk of losing the deal."
