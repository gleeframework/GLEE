"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I need to be at $850,000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $750,000? This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to move up a bit, but $825,000 is still a touch high for me. Would you consider $775,000?  That seems like a fair price that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make it worth my while. I'll meet you at $810,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",810000.0,Alice,7,
