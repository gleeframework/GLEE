Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'd like to get a bit closer to what I'm looking for. I can do $140 for the product. It's my last offer, so please let me know if you can meet me there.

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $140, and it's her ""last offer.""  You can get the product for $100 from John, which is your target price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
