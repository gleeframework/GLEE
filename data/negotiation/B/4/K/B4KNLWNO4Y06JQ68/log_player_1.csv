Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $1,400,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is a better price than his previous offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,300,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like I'm not going to get closer to my desired price with Bob.  Even though his offer is higher than John's, the negotiation is dragging on and I'm worried I'll run out of rounds before we agree.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
