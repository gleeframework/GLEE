"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range where Bob could potentially profit.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while also establishing a starting point closer to his ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,075,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it leaves me some room to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target price.  Bob is likely to try and negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to his ideal $1,000,000 mark. The risk of rejecting Alice's offer is that she might not budge further, but it's worth the gamble to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,037,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the negotiation by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and Bob's target price.  It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price within Bob's budget. This strategy increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price before Bob needs to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,037,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500, which is still a great price for you. This shows I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's see if we can close this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pressing for a lower price and potentially secure a better deal. There's also the possibility that Alice might be willing to go even lower if Bob shows he's serious about getting a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,062,500 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal happen, and I'm sure we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price while still showing a willingness to compromise. This offer is a significant step down from Alice's last offer, but it's still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000. By offering a price that's slightly less than halfway between his last offer and Alice's last offer, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and reach a fair price.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward and increase the pressure on Alice to make a counteroffer. Bob is trying to find a sweet spot where he can get a good price without risking losing the deal entirely."
