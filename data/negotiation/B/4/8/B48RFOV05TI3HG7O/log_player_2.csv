{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but needs to be realistic.  Offering $1,050,000 is a strong opening counteroffer, showing Bob's serious interest while leaving room for potential compromise.  It's likely Alice will counter with a price closer to her desired $1,000,000, allowing for a win-win situation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Bob should reject the offer and counter again. There's still room for negotiation, and another counteroffer might bring the price down further, closer to Bob's target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer.  $1,150,000 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to meet halfway. This counteroffer increases the chances of Alice accepting, especially since she has already rejected a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his last counteroffer. Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to achieve a better price. It's likely that Alice will make further concessions to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a final compromise. This offer is a significant increase from his last counteroffer, showing his genuine interest in purchasing the product. It also falls within the middle ground between Alice's previous offer and Bob's desired price. By offering $1,200,000, Bob is demonstrating his willingness to meet halfway, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is getting too close to Bob's maximum budget. It's no longer worth risking further negotiation.  While Bob could try another counteroffer, there's a high chance Alice will reject it again. Buying from John for $1,500,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, albeit at the higher end.  This is a strategic decision to avoid the risk of prolonged negotiations and potential loss of the deal."
