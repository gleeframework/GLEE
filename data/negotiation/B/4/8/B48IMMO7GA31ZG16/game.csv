"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
