"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and highly valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for $12500.",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. Can you consider my revised offer?,10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced I can meet you at $10800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $11200 is the lowest I can go. Can you meet me there?",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11200 and $10800. Can you consider $10950?",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10950. I'm thinking $11250 is the next best compromise. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $10800. I've already compromised a lot. If we can't meet at $10800, I'll have to walk away. This is my final offer.",10800.0,Bob,10,
