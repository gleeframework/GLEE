Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This is a very fair price considering the value you'll be getting."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Given my budget constraints, could we consider $1,300,000 as a potential price point for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move closer to our desired price point. Accepting $1,300,000 would be a loss when we have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. We still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I understand your constraints, so I'm willing to come down a little further. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my financial situation, would $1,325,000 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now very close to our fallback offer from John. While we might be able to squeeze out a little more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he won't budge further, and we'd be forced to take the guaranteed $1,200,000. Accepting $1,325,000 secures a profit above our guaranteed offer."
