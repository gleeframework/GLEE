"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $900,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option, but it's worth seeing if Bob can negotiate a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 
This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that could be acceptable to Bob. This allows for room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room to negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 
This counteroffer is Bob's final offer, as it's his maximum budget. It's likely Alice will either accept this offer, or Bob will buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Since there's no room for further negotiation, Bob should buy the product from John for $800,000."
