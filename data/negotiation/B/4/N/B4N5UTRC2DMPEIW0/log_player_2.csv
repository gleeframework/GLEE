{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** The product is only worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $175.
* **I don't want to buy from John yet.** I'm hoping to get a better price from Alice.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer.**  I can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a bold counteroffer at my maximum value of $100.
* This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and shows my serious intent to negotiate.
* I'm hoping this will either force Alice to accept or make her more willing to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to my value, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. 
* **I want to see if I can negotiate further.**  By rejecting, I can try to push Alice even lower.
* **Buying from John isn't necessary yet.**  I have rounds left and the potential to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm increasing my offer from $100 to $120. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a better price than Alice's current offer of $145.
* I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us. 
* I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer, but still above my target.
* I'm still within my 10 rounds, and have room to negotiate.
* By rejecting, I can attempt to get Alice to come down even further. 
* I'm not yet ready to buy from John. The possibility of getting a better deal from Alice is still there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm sticking with a middle-ground approach.  I'm moving up slightly from my previous offer, but not as high as Alice's latest offer. 
* This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but I'm not giving up on getting a better price than $135.
* With only 4 rounds left, it's getting closer to time to decide whether to buy from John. This offer should be close enough to make Alice consider accepting it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget and is a good deal.** It's only $30 more than my target price, and I've already rejected several offers. 
* **Time is running out.** With only three rounds left, there's a risk that Alice might reject any further counteroffers, or that John might change his mind.
* **Accepting the offer secures the product.** It's a reasonable price, and I'm likely to get a good deal on the product."
