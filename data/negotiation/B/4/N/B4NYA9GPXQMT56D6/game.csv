"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing your interest in the product. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair deal.  Let's work towards a successful outcome together.",900000.0,Alice,3,
