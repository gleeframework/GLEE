Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this presents a significant opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a substantial offer that's still significantly below your minimum and allows Bob a considerable gain on his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price leaves space for a counter-offer from Bob, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement above $1,500,000.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while maintaining a strong position to secure a sale."
