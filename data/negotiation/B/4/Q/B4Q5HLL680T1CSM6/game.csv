"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested, but $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $90.  That's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
