"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you consider $975,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
