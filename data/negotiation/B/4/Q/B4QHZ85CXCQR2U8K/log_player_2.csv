Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000.

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, but she's also willing to negotiate.  At $1,025,000, we're getting a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price. It's unlikely we'll get her much lower, and risking John changing his mind isn't worth the potential savings."
