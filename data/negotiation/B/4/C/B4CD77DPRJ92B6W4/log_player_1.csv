{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit low, and I want to see if we can get closer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to go to $13,500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a bit more if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $13,250 for the product.  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I am willing to pay $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $13,250, we're getting very close to the end of the rounds. It's better to accept Bob's offer of $13,000 than to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for $10,000."
