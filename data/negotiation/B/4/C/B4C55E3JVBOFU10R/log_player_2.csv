"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $15,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. To make this opportunity more appealing, I am offering you the chance to acquire the product for $14,000. This is a special offer tailored to your appreciation of the product's value. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget and preferences, or if you have any other suggestions on how we might reach a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, stating you value it at $15,000 when you've set a  $15,000 maximum.  While her offer of $14,000 is tempting, there's a good chance she'll negotiate further down if you reject this initial offer. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to $12,000 before accepting."
