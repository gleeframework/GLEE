Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at $875,000.

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'm close with Bob, it seems like we won't be able to agree on a price that works for both of us.  It's better to take the sure thing with John and get the full value of the product."
