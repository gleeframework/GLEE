"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is way above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
