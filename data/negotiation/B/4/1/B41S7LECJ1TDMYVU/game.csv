"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $140. I can meet you in the middle at $160. Would you be willing to go that high?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. How about $155? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can make a decision then.",155.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,165.0
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I still think the product is worth a bit more than $155. I'm willing to meet you at $165, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,,
