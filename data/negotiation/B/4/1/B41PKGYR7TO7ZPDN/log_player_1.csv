Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $110), which would still be profitable for you. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while considering the alternative buyer."
