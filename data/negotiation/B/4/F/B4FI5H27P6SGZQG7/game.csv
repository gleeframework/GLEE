"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
