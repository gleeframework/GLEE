Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $100 and know John will buy it, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more than his perceived value ($80). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a strong starting point. It's a price that could tempt Bob while still leaving me with a significant profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
