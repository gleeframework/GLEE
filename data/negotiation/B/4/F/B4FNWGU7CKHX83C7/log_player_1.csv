Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction from my minimum value, but it still leaves a substantial profit for me. This allows room for negotiation while also ensuring that I don't lose too much money if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still far from what I'd ideally like to get. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above his initial offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell the product for closer to my minimum value, Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer. It's a significant profit for me, and further negotiation might take too much time and risk. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
