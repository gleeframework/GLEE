"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to acquire the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident that you'll find it a good value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than where I can go right now.  I'm going to offer $775,000. This is a solid price that reflects the value of the product, while also allowing me to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $810,000, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we're close. I'm going to offer $790,000. This is my final offer, and it's as high as I can go while staying within my budget.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to explore other options.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $790,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll meet you at $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",820000.0,Alice,7,
