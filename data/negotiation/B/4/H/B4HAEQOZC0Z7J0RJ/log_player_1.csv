"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I could meet you halfway at $12,000 and not a penny higher.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reasoning: Bob is unlikely to go higher than his last offer of $12,000.  Holding out for a potentially slightly better offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
