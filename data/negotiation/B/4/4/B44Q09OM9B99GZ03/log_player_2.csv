"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can save more money by counteroffering Alice. $120 is still a bit higher than your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to go down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I offer it to you for $125? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to your desired price point, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $125 is still a little higher than my ideal price. Would you consider $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about I meet you at $122? It's a great compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's likely that Alice is reaching her limit on how low she's willing to go.  Accepting her offer at $122 is still a good deal for you, as it's within your budget and saves you $28 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it could also risk losing the deal entirely."
