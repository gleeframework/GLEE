Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth.

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. Based on my calculations and the value I perceive in the product, I would like to counteroffer at $1,330,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $1,330,000 offer secures a significant profit above the $1,000,000 alternative with John and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
