Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000 (because I can sell to John for that amount). 
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm offering a price that is significantly lower than Bob's maximum, giving him a good deal while still ensuring a large profit for myself. 

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a high chance of Bob accepting the deal."
