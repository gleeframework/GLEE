"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  It has the potential to generate substantial returns for you, well beyond that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob is likely to be able to secure a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  There are still 7 rounds left, and it's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. Given the potential of the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good deal. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to the end of the rounds. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
