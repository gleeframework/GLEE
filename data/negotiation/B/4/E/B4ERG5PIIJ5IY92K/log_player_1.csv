Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe this strategy will give me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I don't want to settle for the bare minimum. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this will incentivize Bob to negotiate further, hopefully leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a higher profit."
