"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate or head over to John."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my actual maximum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a better deal. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed politely, expressing interest while also being clear about my budget limitations. This encourages further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to spend. I'll try negotiating one more time before going to John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair offer considering its value to both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:**  I'm inching closer to my maximum price ($80) but staying firm on getting a deal. Offering $75 shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that works for me.
* **Justification:** I've included a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the ""win-win"" aspect of the proposed price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm offering the product to you for $85. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is down to $85, which is only $5 above my maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal entirely.  It's a small compromise for a product I want."
