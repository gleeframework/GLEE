"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair offer considering its value to both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm offering the product to you for $85. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
