"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. How about we meet in the middle again? I'll offer you $17000, and that's as low as I can go.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the profit margin. I'll offer you $16300, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16300.0,Alice,9,
