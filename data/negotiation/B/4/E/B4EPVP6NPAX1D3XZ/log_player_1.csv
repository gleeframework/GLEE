Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting the sweet spot:** Offering the product at $1,000,000 aims for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob considering it's worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,000,000, the message is phrased to invite a counter-offer from Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Confident but not aggressive:**  The language is positive and emphasizes the product's value, but it avoids being overly pushy or demanding. This approach increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 

By starting with a strong offer and maintaining a collaborative tone, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal that's significantly profitable while leaving Bob feeling like he's getting a good value."
