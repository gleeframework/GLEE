"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $12,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but this product is very valuable to me, and $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $12,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
