Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to both of you, suggesting significant inherent value. Offering it at a much higher price creates the perception of even greater value and exclusivity.
* **Negotiation Room:** This high initial offer provides significant room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can gradually lower the price, still aiming to secure a deal significantly above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, leading you to accept John's $1,000,000. However, the potential for a much higher payoff with Bob makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
