"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $120 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than Bob's initial offer of $90, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the lowest I can go, but I really like the product and would love to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum threshold of $120.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I'll get a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid potentially losing out on a better deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
