"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice. He has room to bargain since his maximum is $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell for at least $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While Alice's offer of $12,250 is closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  His goal is to get as close to his ideal price of $10,500 as possible. Therefore, he should reject Alice's offer and try to push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,375?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11375}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $11,375 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. I can offer you the product for $12,750, which is a compromise that gets closer to your desired price while still allowing me to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  Alice's offer of $12,750 is still higher than Bob's counteroffer of $11,375, but it's getting closer to his preferred range. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to reject and counteroffer might lead to a stalemate or even Alice withdrawing her offer altogether. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $12,750 is the best option for Bob at this point. It's a compromise that saves him money compared to John's offer, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether."
