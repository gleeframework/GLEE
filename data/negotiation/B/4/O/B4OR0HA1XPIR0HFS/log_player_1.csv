Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're serious about selling but not desperate. 

Remember, if Bob rejects, you can always counteroffer or move on to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum, and you're better off trying to negotiate a higher price or selling to John.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 13500}
