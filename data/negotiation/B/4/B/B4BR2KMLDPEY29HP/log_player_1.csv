Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 from John.

**Strategy**

The key is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value makes it attractive while still netting you a significant gain.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know how valuable it is, and I believe a price of $1,400,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is polite, emphasizes the product's value, and introduces a slight sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Price:** $1,400,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount (incentivizing him to buy) and earns you $200,000 above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to adjust slightly, but remember your minimum and the guaranteed sale to John."
