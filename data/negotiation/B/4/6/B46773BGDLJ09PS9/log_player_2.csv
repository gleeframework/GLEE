"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring better deals before committing.  $600,000 is a good price, but there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

Let's start by making a significant counteroffer.  $500,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price.  It's likely she'll counter with a higher price, but this sets the stage for a more favorable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $650,000 is still a decent price, Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate. I'm going to try to push for a lower price again.  There's still a chance we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

Alice is willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  $550,000 is a reasonable middle ground.  It shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for her to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is pushing the price back up. We need to be firm but persistent.  I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

We're getting closer.  Let's meet Alice halfway this time.  $600,000 is a fair compromise.  I'm confident she'll accept this offer, but if not, I'll have to start seriously considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice seems unwilling to budge much further. We've reached a point where her counteroffers are getting too close to John's price.  To avoid further negotiation and potential risk, it's best to secure the product from John at $800,000. It's within my budget and guarantees a purchase."
