Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it allows room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while still remaining above my minimum threshold.  I hope this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered $8,500 which is more than what John is offering. While I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a better profit than selling to John."
