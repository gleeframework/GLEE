"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $10,000. How about $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. How about $10,000? That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
