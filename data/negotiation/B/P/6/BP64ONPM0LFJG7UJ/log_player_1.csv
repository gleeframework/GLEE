Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum price of $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down a little if he wants, while still keeping you well above your fallback price of $80.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is concise, offering the product and price without unnecessary complexity. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
