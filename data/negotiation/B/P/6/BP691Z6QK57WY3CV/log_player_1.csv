Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer without trying to negotiate down too much.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. A lot depends on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style. For example, if you know Bob is a tough negotiator who likes to lowball, you might start even higher."
