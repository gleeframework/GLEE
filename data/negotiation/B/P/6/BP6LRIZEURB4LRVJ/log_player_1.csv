Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $200 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. This still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's a great price for this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for the same amount, as I've already invested time and energy in negotiating with Bob."
