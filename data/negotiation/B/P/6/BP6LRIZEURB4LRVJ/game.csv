"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. This still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's a great price for this product. Let's find a middle ground.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can agree.",150.0,Bob,4,
