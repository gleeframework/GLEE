Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'll try to get a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How does $10,812 sound?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,812 is a good price, and it's important to get a deal done.  I'm getting very close to my minimum price, and there's no guarantee I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
