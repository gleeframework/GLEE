"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  How about we try $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $650,000 is about the absolute highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close to a dealbreaker for me.  I can budge a tiny bit more, but this is it.  If you'll accept $660,000, we have an agreement.",660000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting close to a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $660,000. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $665,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",665000.0,Alice,9,
