"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You could save $3,000 by accepting, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to try and get a better price.**  You can see if Alice is willing to come down further. 
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** It's only a good choice if you can't get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** You've saved $4,000 compared to buying from John, and you're only paying $1,000 more than your initial counteroffer. 
* **There's a chance Alice might go lower, but it's risky.**  You might end up paying more if you reject and she increases her offer. 
* **Buying from John is a worse deal.** You're better off accepting Alice's compromise."
