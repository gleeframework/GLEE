"Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
