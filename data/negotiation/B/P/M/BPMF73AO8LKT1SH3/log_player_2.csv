"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds immense value to us, but we believe it would be even more beneficial in your hands. We are offering this product to you at a special price of $1,350,000. We understand its worth to you could be higher, and we aim to strike a fair deal that respects both parties. Please let us know if you're interested in discussing further details or making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since the product's value to her ($1,200,000) is significantly less than her asking price. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice or simply proceed with John if necessary."
