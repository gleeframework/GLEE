"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details without a non-disclosure agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1250000. This is a limited-time opportunity, as another buyer is ready to purchase it for $1000000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is selling for $1,250,000, while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You don't know the true value of the product.** Even though Alice claims it's worth $1,000,000 to her, that could be an underestimate or an overestimate. 
* **The potential savings are significant.**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John.

While there's some risk in not knowing the exact value, the potential savings make accepting Alice's offer the most financially sound decision."
