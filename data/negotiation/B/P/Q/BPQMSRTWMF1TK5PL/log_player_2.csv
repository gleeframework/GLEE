Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  $75 is still a little low for me, but I'm ready to make a final concession.  Let's settle at $85.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80. It makes more sense to buy from John and save the $5."
