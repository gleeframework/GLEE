Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal and value, rather than focusing on my own cost. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A counteroffer from Bob is likely, and I'm prepared to negotiate. 
* **The John Option:** I have a backup plan with John, so I'm not pressured to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed $150 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $90 is a reasonable midpoint between my last offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($60).
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal and the value of the product to Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to push him higher. 
* **John is the safety net:**  I have a guaranteed $150 from John, so I can afford to be firm and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  $75 is still a little low for me, but I'm ready to make a final concession.  Let's settle at $85.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $85 is a compromise between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's last offer ($75). 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, making it a ""win-win"" situation.
* **Close to Minimum:**  While it's still below my ideal price, $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm more likely to sell to John."
