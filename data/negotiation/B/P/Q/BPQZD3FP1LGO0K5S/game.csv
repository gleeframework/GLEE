"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  I'm really interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $6,500.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $6,800. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",6800.0,Alice,3,
