"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob to pique his interest.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm  keeping the door open for dialogue and understanding Bob's perspective. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1500000. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. 

* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* **Value Perception:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate the value I place on the product and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I have the opportunity to counteroffer and see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point.

I will counteroffer with a price closer to $950,000, but still above my minimum, to see if I can bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue discussing this. While I value your interest, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $980,000? This would allow me to  move forward with the deal, and I believe it's still a good investment opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reinforcing the investment potential of the product for Bob.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm keeping my counteroffer above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness in purchasing the product while still preserving my desired profit margin. I'm hoping this will lead to a swift agreement, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating in the following rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I propose we aim for a price closer to $960000. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I'm confident I can't secure a much better deal given his budget constraints and the fact that we are already in round 4. 

* **Time is of the Essence:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Profitable Outcome:** Accepting his offer will secure a profit of $160,000, which is a reasonable outcome considering the risk of further negotiations.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Accepting his offer minimizes the risk of Bob walking away or my needing to sell to John at a lower price.

It's a good compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid further negotiations."
