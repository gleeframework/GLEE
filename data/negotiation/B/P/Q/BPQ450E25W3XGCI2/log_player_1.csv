"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. This ""anchoring"" technique can influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Justify the Price:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""benefits,"" you aim to shift Bob's focus from the price tag to the value he'll receive. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** The high initial offer allows you to make concessions in later rounds while still aiming for a price that's highly profitable for you. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Carefully analyze Bob's counteroffer (if any) to understand his perceived value and willingness to pay.
* **John as Backup:**  Keep John's guaranteed offer in mind as a potential fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, I can't afford that price right now. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Continue Negotiation:** You have ample rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Signal Flexibility:** By rejecting, you show Bob that you're willing to negotiate but not at any cost. 

**Next Steps:**

In Round 3, you'll need to present a counteroffer that strikes a balance between:

* **Conceding Ground:**  Moving closer to Bob's range to show you're open to a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:** Avoid drastically dropping your price, as it could signal desperation and weaken your negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, my initial price reflects the true worth of this product and the substantial returns it can generate. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position.  It's a clear signal to Bob that you're serious about closing a deal but not at the expense of undervaluing the product.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reinforces the product's inherent value and potential for returns, subtly justifying the higher price point. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The counteroffer still allows for further negotiation if Bob isn't immediately receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still too much for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's ""Final Offer"":**  By stating this is his final offer, Bob signals limited flexibility and a potential unwillingness to move significantly higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's $1,400,000 offer means losing out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 
* **Limited Upside:** Even with further negotiation, it's unlikely you'll bridge the gap to a price that significantly outweighs John's offer, especially considering Bob's firm stance. 

**Conclusion:**

While selling to Bob might be tempting, John's offer provides a certain and equal or greater profit without the risk of prolonged negotiation and potential for a less favorable outcome."
