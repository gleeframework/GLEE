"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than mine. I need to negotiate a lower price or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This tactic aims to quickly establish my price range and leave room for negotiation.
* **Target Zone:** My ideal price is somewhere between Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and my maximum ($800,000).  Starting low gives us space to hopefully meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John as Leverage:**  I have the option to buy from John for $800,000. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation.  Alice doesn't know my exact walk-away price, but this starting point suggests I might have alternatives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $1,200,000 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made a concession, the new price is still too high for me. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to move the price closer to my range.  I'll also keep in mind I have the John option if we can't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly below hers.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer moves me closer to the middle ground between our initial positions. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit. I need to increase my offers at a reasonable pace if I want to reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer of $700,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer of $600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice's concessions are getting smaller, and we're still quite a bit above my target price. 
* **John Option:**  The price difference between Alice's offer and buying from John is shrinking. It might be time to signal I'm seriously considering my alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  To be honest, I've found similar products for less, but I believe yours offers unique advantages.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a final attempt to make this work."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:**  I'm framing this as my ""final attempt"" to add pressure and signal to Alice that she needs to move closer to my range. 
* **Mentioning Alternatives:** Without revealing my exact fallback option (John), I'm implying that I have other choices, which may push Alice to be more flexible.
* **Small Increase:**  The small increase in my offer shows good faith but also reinforces that I'm not willing to budge much more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've done your research and found similar products, but I'm confident that this one stands out from the rest. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:**  Alice's final offer matches my maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **No Benefit to John:**  John's offer is also $800,000.  There's no cost advantage to switching to John at this point. 
* **Deal Secured:** Accepting this offer secures the product for the best possible price I could achieve through negotiation."
