"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is way above my budget for this product. I'm interested but could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $14,000. This is a considerable compromise and my bottom line.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still pushing my budget.  I could potentially go up to $12,500, but that's my absolute limit.",12500.0,Bob,6,
