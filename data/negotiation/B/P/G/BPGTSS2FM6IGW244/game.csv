"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to both of us, so let's start with a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000?  This is a significant investment for both of us, so I'm sure we can reach a compromise that works for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $975,000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $1,012,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalise the deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product",990000.0,Bob,6,
