Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept, which is below his perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your guaranteed price from John.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price."
