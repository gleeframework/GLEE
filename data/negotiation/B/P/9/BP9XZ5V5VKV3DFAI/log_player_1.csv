Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended. This encourages Bob to respond and reveals how interested he is in the product.  If he's eager, he might accept the price outright. If not, it opens the door for further discussion. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 gives Alice a safety net.  Even if Bob declines, Alice is guaranteed to make her minimum."
