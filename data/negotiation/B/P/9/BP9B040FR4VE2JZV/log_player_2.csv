"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and you can potentially save some money."

I'm offering $800,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a fair price given my $1,000,000 budget. This should give Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is better than $900,000, there's still room to negotiate. I'll reject and try for a lower price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $825,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price below Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  I'm only saving $65,000 by continuing to negotiate, and the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is too high.  $835,000 is a good price."
