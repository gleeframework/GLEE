"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet at $120? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",120.0,Alice,5,
