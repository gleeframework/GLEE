Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This gives Bob a potential gain of $2,000, making the offer attractive. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is below my minimum value for the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still gives Bob a potential profit of $1,000. I hope this will be more appealing to him than selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum value, and I've already made a compromise in my previous counteroffer.  To avoid further negotiations, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures I reach my minimum value."
