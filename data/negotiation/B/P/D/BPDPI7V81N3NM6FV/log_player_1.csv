Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is well above your minimum price of $1,000,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is below Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000, giving him a reason to negotiate. 
* **It's a strong opening:** A bold initial offer can help you secure a higher final price.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your desired price and leaves you with less profit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,300,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still protecting your profit.  You're moving closer to Bob's offer but not so far as to give away too much.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on finding common ground.  This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.

By making a counteroffer, you are keeping the negotiations going. You can then assess Bob's next response and determine if it is worth continuing to negotiate or accepting his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1250000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below your initial target, but it's a significant improvement over his previous offer. It's important to weigh the following:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While you could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and lead to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting the offer ensures a profit of $250,000, which is a considerable sum.

Considering the above, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It secures a substantial profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether or spending more time negotiating."
