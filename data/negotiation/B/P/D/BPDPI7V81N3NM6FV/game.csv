"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1300000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1250000?
