"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $18000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $16500. This is a fair price, and it gives us both room to work with.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we meet at $17500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $17000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",17000.0,Bob,6,
