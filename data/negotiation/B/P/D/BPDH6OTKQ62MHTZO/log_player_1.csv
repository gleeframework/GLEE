Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I've reached a point where Bob's offer is only $1,000 lower than my initial offer, and he's already gone up to $17,000. Considering that I can sell the product to John for $15,000, I think it's time to take a more cautious approach. I'll reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John for $15,000, as it's a guaranteed sale and I won't have to continue negotiating with Bob.
