"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I think it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and counter-offer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product. $15,000 is quite steep for me, could you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a great deal quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This low offer leaves ample room for negotiation, allowing us to gradually increase our offer if needed while staying well below our $8,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Open to Discussion:** The message is respectful and maintains a positive tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents the value I place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down in price, but it's still significantly higher than both your budget and your alternative option with John. It's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still a ways off from that price point. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Significant Increase, But Below Max:** This counteroffer shows Alice we're serious but keeps us safely below our $8,000 limit. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** The large jump from our previous offer tests how much Alice is truly willing to move on price.
* **Maintaining Open Communication:** The message remains respectful and emphasizes our continued interest in finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $10,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reasoning:

* **Alice is Firm:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Above Budget:** Even with her concession, $10,000 still exceeds your $8,000 maximum.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have a secure option with John at $8,000, saving you $2,000. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed, budget-friendly deal with John."
