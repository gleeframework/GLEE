"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product provides you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen.",9250.0,Alice,5,
