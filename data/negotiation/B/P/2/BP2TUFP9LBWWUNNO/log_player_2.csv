"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its market value is $1200000 to you. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's below your maximum, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to me and your own valuation, I'm willing to offer $750,000. This would provide a fair return for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer significantly lowers the price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and potentially push Alice towards a more favorable deal.

Considering the product's value to you and my own valuation, I'm willing to offer a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference again and go with $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while still remaining within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Compromise:** The message demonstrates a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway again, showing good faith and a desire to reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Alice has lowered her offer to $850,000, which is only $50,000 above your initial counteroffer of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to John is high.
* **Reasonable Price:** While not ideal, $850,000 is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the potential cost of buying from John.

It's strategically advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's within your budget."
