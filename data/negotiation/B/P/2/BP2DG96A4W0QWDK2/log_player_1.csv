Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While your offer is tempting, the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,120,000. How about we discuss $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate with Bob.  We need to signal we're willing to move but not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer represents a significant concession from our previous offer and puts us close to the midpoint between our initial ask and Bob's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Alternative Option:** We're still holding strong above John's offer, providing us with a safety net if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000, but I'd like to get closer to my target. Can we discuss $1,060,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,060,000 is still a significant profit over our minimum and John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or us having to settle for even less. Accepting now secures a good outcome. 
* **Time:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Dragging it out further might not yield significantly better results."
