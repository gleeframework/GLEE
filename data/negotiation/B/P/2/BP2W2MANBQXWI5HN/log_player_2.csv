Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway. I propose a final offer of $1040000 for the product. This price reflects both the value of the item and my desire to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,040,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price of $1,000,000, it's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a guarantee of a lower price. It's better to secure this deal and save a substantial amount."
