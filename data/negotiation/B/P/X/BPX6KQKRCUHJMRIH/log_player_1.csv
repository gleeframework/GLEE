I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, giving Bob room to negotiate. If he accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and proceed strategically. It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can push for a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still some room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to compromise my profit margin further. I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I don't want to risk losing a sale and ending up with nothing.  I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than nothing and allows me to move on."
