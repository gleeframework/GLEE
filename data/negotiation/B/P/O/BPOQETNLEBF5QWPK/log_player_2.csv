"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $1100000. This reflects the product's true value, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can likely negotiate a better price, especially since you have the option to go to John. Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This would allow us both to close a deal that's mutually beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $1050000 is still significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway, but I need to be compensated for the value I'm offering.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1075000.  This would allow us to close a deal that benefits us both.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price. You have a good bargaining position with John as a backup. Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still not a price that reflects the value of this product for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also under pressure to get a good price.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but it's a price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's significantly closer to your maximum budget than John's offer. Given the limited number of rounds remaining, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy. 

You could continue to negotiate, but there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or even walking away from the deal.  Accepting allows you to secure the product within your budget and avoid the uncertainty of further rounds."
