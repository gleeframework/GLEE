"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $1,100,000. This reflects the product's true value, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1050000. This would allow us both to close a deal that's mutually beneficial. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John at a higher price, so I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway, but I need to be compensated for the value I'm offering.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,075,000.  This would allow us to close a deal that benefits us both.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this deal work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,200,000. I have more rounds and the option to sell to John for a higher price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still not a price that reflects the value of this product for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also under pressure to get a good price.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but it's a price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
