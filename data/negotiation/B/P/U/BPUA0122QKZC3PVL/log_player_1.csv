"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and still offers you a significant value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's less than $9,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $9,200 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting it for less than my original asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,000.  While I'd prefer more,  accepting his offer ensures a deal and saves me time and effort in further negotiation.  There's a good chance I'll be able to get a higher price from John if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
