Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $119. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still ensures you get more than his perceived value of $100.
* **Avoid Greed:**  Offering it at $120 or slightly less to Bob might seem tempting, but it significantly decreases the chances of him accepting. A slightly lower price increases the likelihood of a sale and a higher profit than your guaranteed offer."
