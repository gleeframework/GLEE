"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's potential to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be appealing to Bob while still getting a price closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. He's moved up from his initial $800,000, and while I'd love to get closer to my target price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $850,000 is a good compromise, and I'm happy with the outcome."
