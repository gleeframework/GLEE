"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to profit. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the product's true value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
