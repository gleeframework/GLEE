Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a small discount while still netting you a higher profit than selling to John.  
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly."
