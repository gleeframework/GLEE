Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it could be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price higher than $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum acceptable price.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** Offering at $12,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still remaining above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during the negotiation if Bob shows resistance, but don't go below your $10,000 minimum."
