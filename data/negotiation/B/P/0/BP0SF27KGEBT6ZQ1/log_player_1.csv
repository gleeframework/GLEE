Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $750,000, but that's my limit.  It's a fair offer considering what I can get it for elsewhere.

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that reflects the product's value to me. It's clear that our valuations are too far apart. Selling to John ensures I get the minimum I need."
