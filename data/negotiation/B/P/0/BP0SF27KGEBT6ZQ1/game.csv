"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I would need to see it closer to $600,000 to make it work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter offer.  That's quite a gap between our valuations.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, I can't go quite that low.  How about we consider $2,000,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a reasonable price.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but that price doesn't reflect the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,700,000?  I'm really trying to make this work for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $750,000, but that's my limit.  It's a fair offer considering what I can get it for elsewhere.",750000.0,Bob,6,
