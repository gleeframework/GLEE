Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter offer.  That's quite a gap between our valuations.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, I can't go quite that low.  How about we consider $2,000,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its true worth.
