"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1250000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1275000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
