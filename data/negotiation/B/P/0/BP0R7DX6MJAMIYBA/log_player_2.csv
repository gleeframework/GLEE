"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1,075,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum budget. Although it's closer, the potential for further negotiation is uncertain. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's more secure to go with that option and avoid further risk."
