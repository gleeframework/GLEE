"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1,075,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,3,
