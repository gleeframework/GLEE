Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer.  While I could push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll budge further. Accepting $800,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product altogether."
