Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This gives me a good margin above my minimum of $15,000. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and we can then negotiate from there. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm always prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $16,000 is more than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to counteroffer at $18,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a reasonable profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Bob has come up to $17,000, which is pretty close to my desired price.  While I'd like to get a bit more, I don't want to risk losing him entirely and having to sell to John for $15,000. It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
