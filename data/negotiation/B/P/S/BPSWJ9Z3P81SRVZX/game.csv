"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $14000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think you're getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $15500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
