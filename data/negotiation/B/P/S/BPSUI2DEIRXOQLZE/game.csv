"I'm very interested in the product, but $999000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $950000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm afraid $920000 is still not enough for me. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $970000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",970000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm afraid $970000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll make one final offer: $910000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",910000.0,Bob,6,
