"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us. Let's make this transaction smooth and beneficial for both parties. I propose a price of $110 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will be willing to go lower. It's better to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am willing to sell the product for $107. This price reflects my desire to close the deal while also considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is a fair price considering my maximum is $120. Accepting this offer saves me $13 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might save a few more dollars but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
