"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. You are offering a price that is still above your maximum budget, but significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping your offer attractive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your maximum budget, you can still get the product for $12,000 from John. There's no reason to pay more, especially since you already made a counteroffer. Keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

You've already rejected Alice's offer of $13,500, so this counteroffer shows you're willing to meet her halfway, but still want to save some money. This is a reasonable compromise that might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget. However, you can still get the product from John for a lower price. Since you've already rejected Alice's previous offer and made a counteroffer, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price. It's safer to go with John and secure the product for your desired price."
