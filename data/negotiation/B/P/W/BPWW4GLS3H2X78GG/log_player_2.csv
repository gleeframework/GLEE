``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:** Costs $1,100,000
* **Buying from John:** Costs $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, the goal is to save money, and this offer already achieves that."
