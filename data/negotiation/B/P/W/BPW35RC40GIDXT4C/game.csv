"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we're both aware, the product is worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, so I'll counteroffer $6,800. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $6,300? That's a pretty significant increase from my initial offer.",6300.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $6,300. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll counteroffer $6,700. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.
