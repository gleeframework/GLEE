"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my interest.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that  $1,300,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think this price is the lowest I can go. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
