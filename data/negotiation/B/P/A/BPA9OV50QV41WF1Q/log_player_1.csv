"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate while also testing Bob's interest level. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round.  My goal is to get closer to my minimum price, and I believe I can do that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round. This shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum. I believe that 11,500 is a fair price considering my minimum and Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will lead to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I have limited time, I'm determined to get closer to my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer again, and I'm prepared to sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me. With only five rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between holding out for a higher price and ensuring a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. With limited rounds left, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try to get closer to my goal. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to show my willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go lower than this. I'm hoping Bob will realize that I'm serious about making a deal and will accept my counteroffer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm running out of time, and it's not likely that I'll be able to get Bob to agree to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000 to guarantee that I at least meet my minimum price goal."
