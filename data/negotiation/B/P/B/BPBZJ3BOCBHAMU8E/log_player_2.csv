**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck on a price point close to her original offer. It's unlikely she'll go down significantly.  At this point, further negotiation with Alice is risky as you're running out of rounds.  Buying from John for $12,000 ensures you get the product and avoids the risk of Alice not budging."
