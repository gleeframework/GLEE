"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. I could do $11,000 for the product.  Do you think that would work?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $11,500 to close this out.  What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $12,000? That would be a great compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,7,
