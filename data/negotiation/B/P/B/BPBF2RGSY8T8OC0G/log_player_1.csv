"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're comfortable with $12,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You know Bob values it at $15,000, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear starting point:** This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price. There's still a potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but not give away the product too cheaply.
* **Counter-offer is lower than your initial offer:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Counter-offer is still above your minimum:** You're still comfortable with this price, as it's above your $12,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. I could do $11,000 for the product.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, you still have 6 rounds left in the negotiation. You can potentially get closer to your ideal price if you continue negotiating with Bob. There's a good chance you can get him to increase his offer by a few thousand dollars before you need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not too eager to accept his offer.
* **Counter-offer is lower than your previous offer:** This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Counter-offer is closer to your minimum:**  You're getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Counter-offer leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a chance to counter without feeling like he's losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $11,500 to close this out.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, there are still 4 rounds left.  You're close to getting a better price, and you still have the option of selling to John if this negotiation falls through.  It's worth trying to get closer to your ideal price by making a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $12,000? That would be a great compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not too eager to accept his offer.
* **Counter-offer is at your minimum acceptable price:**  You're comfortable with this price and there's no need to go lower.
* **Counter-offer is a clear end point:** This gives Bob a chance to accept and finalize the deal or walk away."
