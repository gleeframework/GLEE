Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I know this product holds significant worth for you, and I'm prepared to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit beyond your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping you well above your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could start higher and be willing to negotiate more. The key is to balance ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
