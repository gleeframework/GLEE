Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  so there's no risk in starting with a price significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still allowing Alice to potentially secure a price well above her minimum.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" Alice creates a basis for the high price without explicitly revealing her minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
