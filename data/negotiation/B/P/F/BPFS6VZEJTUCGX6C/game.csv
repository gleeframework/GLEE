"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price is still a fair value considering the product's worth to you and allows me to meet my own financial goals. Let's make this deal happen.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,112,500. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1112500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,112,500 is still a bit below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,118,750. This reflects the value the product holds for you while still allowing me to reach my financial goals. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1118750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going above $1,100,000, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,114,375. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value the product holds for both of us.",1114375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $1,114,375 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $1,116,562.50.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal. ",1116562.5,Alice,7,
