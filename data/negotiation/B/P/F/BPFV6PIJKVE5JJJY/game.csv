"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,350,000 as a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, so I'll propose $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,337,500.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and our previous offers.  Let's finalize this deal.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose $1,322,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous offers. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1322500.0,Bob,6,
