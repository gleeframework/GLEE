"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire an item valued at $10,000 by you, while ensuring you get it at a reasonable price. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your value:** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering $9,500. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

Since you're rejecting Alice's offer, you'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice. The goal is to get the price closer to your value or even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to consider $8,750 for the product, which still allows us to stay within a reasonable range for both parties. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.
