"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I have room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit.
* **Confidence & Value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in its worth. This helps build a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider a higher price. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate, knowing that I have a fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows interest. This means there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to explore finding a price that works for both of us. 
* **Selling to John is an Option:** I have a guaranteed fallback option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer out of desperation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is significantly below my starting price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,750,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($2,000,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The offer of $1,750,000 still significantly exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures I'm not giving away too much value.
* **Fair Deal Emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1375000. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $1,375,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to accept a deal that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I believe we can find a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **Maintaining My Position:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm firm in my valuation of the product and that I'm not desperate to sell. This strengthens my negotiating position."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,375,000 doesn't meet my minimum price, I'm willing to come down slightly further.  Let's aim for $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident this price is within your budget and allows you to acquire a product you've expressed strong interest in."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, But Not Too Much:** I'm reducing my offer slightly from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing flexibility. However, this price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't sell below my value.
* **Focus on Fair Deal:**  I continue to emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging him to see the value in my offer.
* **Reinforce Value:**  I remind Bob of his expressed interest and that this price allows him to acquire a valuable product. This helps build a sense of urgency and might encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1600000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1375000.  This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can come to a decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is sticking to his offer of $1,375,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a favorable outcome for me.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially ending up with a lower price than what I can get from John.
* **Guaranteed Deal with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement and allows me to exit this negotiation without further risk. 

It's a difficult choice, as I'd prefer to earn more than $1,500,000. However, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting nothing is too high. Selling to John secures my minimum and allows me to move on."
