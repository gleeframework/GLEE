{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there is potential for a price that makes you both happy. 
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:**  By starting with a price below Bob's perceived value, you signal that you are open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price by making a counteroffer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

While $10,750 is close to your minimum, it's still below your goal.  It's worth one more counteroffer to try and get closer to your target."
