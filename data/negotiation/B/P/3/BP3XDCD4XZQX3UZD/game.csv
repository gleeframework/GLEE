"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll likely experience.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the considerable worth of the product and represents a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this, and I respect that.  While $800,000 is closer to its value for you, I need to be mindful of my own investment.  Let's make this happen - I propose $900,000 as my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
