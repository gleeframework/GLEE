Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he has an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is close to my desired price. It is better to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for a lower price."
