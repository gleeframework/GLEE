"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm starting with $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm going to try to get closer to that number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $13,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $13,500? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500. How about $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,750 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below my ideal outcome.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to push the price higher. I have six rounds left and can always sell to John for $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $12,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000. That's a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit and keeps us both happy.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12750 and $13000. How about $12875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $12,875 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can do better with Bob. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as I have 4 rounds remaining and can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to do the same.  I can't go any lower than $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12750 and $13000, but I need to get closer to $12500. How about $12875 is still too high, but $12875 is a bit too low for you. How about $12750 is too low for you. How about $12900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that I can convince Bob to go higher. The offer of $12,900 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  It's better to sell the product to John for $15,000 and secure a much better deal."
