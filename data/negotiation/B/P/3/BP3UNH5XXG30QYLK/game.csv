"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit while considering your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there with your latest offer. $950,000 is a significant difference from what I need. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, but it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your price.  $960,000 is getting closer, but I'm still stuck at $970,000.  This is a very valuable product for me, but I'm determined to make this work for both of us.  Let's try to find that middle ground.",970000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit stuck at $960,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $960,000 and $970,000, so I'll offer $965,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me.",965000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your coming up to $965,000.  I'm still a bit off on price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $965,000 and $970,000, which brings us to $967,500.  Let's close this deal. I'm confident you won't regret it.",967500.0,Alice,9,
