Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately far too low for me. This product is exceptionally valuable, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price for it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 simply isn't enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.
