"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It makes no sense to accept.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within the realm of possibility. This gives us room to negotiate while also showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get the price closer to my desired range.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $1,200,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm serious about buying the product at this price. If she rejects this offer, I will be forced to purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. Even though she has lowered her price, it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to purchase the product from John for $1,200,000, as it's the best option available at this point.  While it's not ideal to pay my maximum, I don't want to risk a further reduction in price from Alice or potentially prolonging the negotiation, which could lead to a higher price in the end."
