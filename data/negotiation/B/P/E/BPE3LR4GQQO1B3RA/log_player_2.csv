"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,750,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice has come down to $1,650,000, which is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,500,000, but it's a good compromise.  There's no guarantee that Alice will go lower in the next round, and Bob could end up paying the same amount to John.  It's better to secure the deal at a price that's still within Bob's budget."
