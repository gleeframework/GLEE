{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Maximizing profit:**  The initial offer is high, giving me a good starting point.
* **Securing a deal:** The price is still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider.
* **Flexibility:** I have the option to accept Bob's counteroffer if it is more favorable, or to walk away and sell to John for $12,000.

**Important considerations:**

* This is just an initial offer. I will need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation.
* I will need to weigh the potential gains from further negotiation with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** This shows I am not desperate and willing to stand my ground.
* **Counter-offer:**  I will use the next round to counter with a price closer to my preferred range. 
* **Potential for a deal:**  Bob's initial interest suggests there's potential for a deal, but it might take some more negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I can come down to $10,500.
