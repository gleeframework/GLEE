"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $145 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there at $137. Would you consider $135? That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
