"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10500. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider $9500. It's still a great deal for the product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
