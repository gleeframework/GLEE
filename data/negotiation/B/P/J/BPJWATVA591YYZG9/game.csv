"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $85. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",85.0,Alice,5,
