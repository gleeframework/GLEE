Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $950,000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, and offer the product for $1,000,000.
