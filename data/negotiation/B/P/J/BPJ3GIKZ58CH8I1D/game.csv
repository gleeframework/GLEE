"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $950000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, and offer the product for $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
