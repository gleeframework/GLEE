{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the current market."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Confident Messaging:** The tone is positive and positions the product as a valuable opportunity, potentially enticing Bob to accept. 

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

**Best Case Scenario:** Bob accepts the offer, and I secure a higher profit margin than selling to John."
