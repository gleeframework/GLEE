"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested, but I could only do something closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving down, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $80? That's the best I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $80. I'll offer you the product for $87.50. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",87.5,Alice,7,
