Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $80. I'll offer you the product for $87.50. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $85. It's not worth the risk of her sticking to a higher price when you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John."
