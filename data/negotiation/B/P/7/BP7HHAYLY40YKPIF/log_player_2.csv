"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $150 by you, which makes it a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is clearly starting high and trying to imply the product is worth more to me than it is. There's room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming lower than my actual top price ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** I want to keep the interaction positive while clearly signaling that I'm looking for a more significant discount.
* **Justification:** While I haven't directly stated my top price, suggesting $110 implies I'm valuing the product closer to its actual worth to Alice ($120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125 for the product. This is my best offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still do better. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a lower price and are willing to walk away.  There's a good chance she'll come down further, especially since her ""best offer"" is still significantly above her own valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and make it $117?  That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 117
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to her price, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  ""Splitting the difference"" makes the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary. 
* **Urgency:**  By saying ""a fair deal to me,"" it hints that this is getting close to my limit, encouraging her to accept."
