"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice values the product at $100. This suggests there's a potential for a deal at a price lower than $115.  By rejecting the initial offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

You're offering Alice $105, which is still a profit for her (since she values it at $100) and is significantly cheaper than the $115 she initially offered. This counteroffer shows you're serious about getting the product but are willing to pay a fair price that's also good for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a fair price considering your maximum is $120. It's better than John's offer and close enough to your ideal price that it makes sense to accept and avoid further negotiation."
