Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential value."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for him to profit if he finds the product even slightly more valuable than he anticipates.
* **Limited Time Implication:** By not explicitly mentioning John, the offer subtly implies scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly."
