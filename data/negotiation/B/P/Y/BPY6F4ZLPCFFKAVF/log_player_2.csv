Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to come down significantly from her asking price.  At this point, you've made a substantial counteroffer, and she's still asking for more than your maximum budget.  It's more likely she'll continue to increase her price.  Rather than risk going further over your budget, it's better to take the guaranteed price from John."
