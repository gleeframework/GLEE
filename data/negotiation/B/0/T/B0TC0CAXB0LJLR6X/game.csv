"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  However, I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the value, the price you're proposing doesn't quite reflect the product's full worth or potential return for you.  Could you consider something closer to $2,100,000? I'm confident this would be a win-win.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
