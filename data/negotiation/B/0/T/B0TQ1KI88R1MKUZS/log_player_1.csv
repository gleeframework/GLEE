Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my target of $8,000 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $8,500. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still getting me closer to my goal of $8,000."
