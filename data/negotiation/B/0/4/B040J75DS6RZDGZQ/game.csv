,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Would you be willing to consider that?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to go down to $90? This would be a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $95. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
