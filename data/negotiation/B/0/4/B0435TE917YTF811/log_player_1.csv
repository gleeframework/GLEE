"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While tempting, Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not sure I can get him to meet my minimum price.  Considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll take the safe option and sell to him for $8,000."
