"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below the product's value to Bob, it's still above Bob's desired maximum price of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This represents a significant savings for you and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to make a new proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $800,000, and it's significantly less than Alice's initial offer of $900,000. Accepting the offer will allow Bob to secure the product at a favorable price, saving him $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
