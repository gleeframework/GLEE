Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This represents a significant savings for you and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to make a new proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable discount from my initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
