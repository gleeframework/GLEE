"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $1,600,000?  This price is still within your budget and closer to my desired value.  Let's work together to make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show my commitment to the deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1,450,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's settle on $1,550,000. This price represents a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
