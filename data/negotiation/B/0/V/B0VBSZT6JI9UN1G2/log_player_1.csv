"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I think this price reflects that.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully motivate Bob to consider my offer.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value and potential to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiation,  showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is interested, he is clearly underestimating the value of the product.  I can likely get a better price through further negotiation.
* **Time Remaining:** I still have 9 rounds to work with, giving me time to try to reach a more favorable deal.  

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 to show my commitment to making this work.  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm starting with a counter-offer that's closer to my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering my price, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, which could lead to a faster agreement.
* **Highlight the Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Potential to Reach Agreement:**  I have several rounds left and see that Bob is willing to negotiate.  I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for my minimum.

**Next Step:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,500,000, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,600,000.  This is a significant product with real potential, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, slightly lowering my previous offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential to justify the price.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** I'm using a positive and solution-oriented tone, aiming for a collaborative approach.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is Stalled:**  Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum, and I'm not seeing much room for improvement. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for my minimum.

**Next Step:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,500,000, but I'm prepared to sell to John if we can't reach a deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but this is my final offer.  I understand you're working within a budget, but this product really is a unique opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making this my final offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Highlighting the Opportunity:**  I'm reminding Bob of the unique potential of the product. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm emphasizing that this is the last offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm still trying to find common ground, showing a willingness to compromise.

**Next Step:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1550000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1400000 one last time? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time:** We're down to only two rounds left.  The likelihood of Bob significantly increasing his offer is low.
* **Secure Option:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or ending up with no deal at all."
