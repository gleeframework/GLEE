"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a good starting point. It's a fairly aggressive offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives you a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is still a decent profit, it's worth trying to push for a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but it's still a good deal for me, and I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in reaching a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum threshold.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer and finally accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting increasingly concerned that Bob is not going to come up to a price that is acceptable to me.  Although I'd rather get a better price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good option and guarantees me a profit."
