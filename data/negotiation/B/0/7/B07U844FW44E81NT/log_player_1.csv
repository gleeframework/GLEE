{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and open-ended to encourage Bob to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $15000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price, you have room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a higher price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he's genuinely interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $15,000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, but I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $17500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $16000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is close to your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and is a reasonable compromise.  It's likely that continued negotiation might result in only a slight increase in price, and the risk of Bob walking away entirely or you needing to sell to John at the lower price is high. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and relatively favorable outcome."
