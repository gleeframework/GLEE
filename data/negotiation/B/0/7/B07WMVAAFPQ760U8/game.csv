"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $14000? I hope this proposal works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14500, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground!",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $14500 might be a bit steep for me. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, like $14200? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",14200.0,Bob,4,
