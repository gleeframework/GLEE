"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating with Alice.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high, and you have room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a big jump from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This will test Alice's willingness to bargain and potentially give us a good starting point for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a reasonable compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's still a decent savings for me, and it's possible Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,325,000 is getting closer to my target, I believe I can still push for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1310000}
```

I'm going to try to close the gap with a counteroffer of $1,310,000. This is a small increase from my last offer but still leaves room for Alice to accept.  It shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am also committed to getting the best possible price."
