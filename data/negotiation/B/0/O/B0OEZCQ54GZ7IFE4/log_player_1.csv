Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting significantly higher ($1,900,000) allows room for negotiation while aiming for maximum profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense.
* **Exclusivity:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more amenable to the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While John provides a safety net, avoid mentioning him. You want Bob to focus on the product's value, not your backup plan."
