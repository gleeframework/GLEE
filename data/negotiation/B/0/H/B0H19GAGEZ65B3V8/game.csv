"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12800. Can you meet me in the middle?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there at $12800.  How about we try $13200?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for this product. ",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $12900. Let's meet in the middle again, at $13000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
