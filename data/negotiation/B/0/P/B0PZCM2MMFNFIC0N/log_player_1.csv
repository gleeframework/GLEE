I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection, and I think you'll find its true worth exceeds $150.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

However, given the value I place on this item, I cannot agree to $85. I propose we meet in the middle and agree upon a price of $95.
