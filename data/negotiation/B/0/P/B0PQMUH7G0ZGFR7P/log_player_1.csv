Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,750,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While getting to $1,400,000 is tempting, I'm not confident Bob will go much higher.  It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to $1,500,000 within the remaining rounds. Taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the best move at this point."
