"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $1,750,000 was a bit high.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. That's the highest I can go.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Think about it â€“ is a difference of $200,000 really going to make or break your decision? ",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for your product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm not willing to pay any more than that.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
