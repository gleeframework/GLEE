"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price gives us space to negotiate down if necessary, but also ensures I'm not immediately undercutting my own minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While I'm not accepting Bob's current offer, I'm not immediately selling to John either. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Strategic advantage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $1,750,000 was a bit high.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a profitable deal.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and frames the offer as a ""fair"" compromise.
* **Keeping some leverage:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I cannot afford to sell for that price.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not giving up on the negotiation completely.  
* **John is a viable alternative:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, selling to John ensures I get my minimum price. 

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Think about it â€“ is a difference of $200,000 really going to make or break your decision? "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm holding firm at my minimum price while emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Appealing to Bob's logic:**  I'm highlighting that the price difference is relatively small compared to the value of the product.
* **Creating urgency:**  By mentioning my minimum price and implying that I'm close to selling to John, I'm adding some pressure for Bob to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for your product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm not willing to pay any more than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:**  $1,200,000 is far below my minimum price of $1,500,000, and it's unlikely he will go higher.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already in round 6, and continuing to negotiate with Bob is risking a deal with John.
* **John provides certainty:** Selling to John guarantees I receive my minimum price and allows me to close the deal without further risk. 

It's time to secure the deal with John and move on."
