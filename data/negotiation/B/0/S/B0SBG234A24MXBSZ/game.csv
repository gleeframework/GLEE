"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? I think that's a fair price for this exceptional product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. I think that's a fair price for this high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
