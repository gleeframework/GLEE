Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm selling, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and invite Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider its worth. 

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** A higher starting price gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Encourage Engagement:** The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to actively participate in the process.
* **Maintain Control:**  The offer is a strong starting point, but I'm prepared to counteroffer or walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm framing the price as a good deal that reflects the product's value, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message keeps the door open for further discussion, allowing for potential flexibility in future rounds. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a lower price but still maintaining a profitable margin, I aim to:

* **Encourage Acceptance:**  $17,000 is a more realistic price point that might encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Control Negotiation:**  By maintaining a firm but negotiable stance, I retain control over the negotiation process.
* **Maximize Profit:**  $17,000 is significantly higher than my minimum, ensuring a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **Room for Counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my previous offer.  I'll aim for a price that's closer to my target while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $15,500? It's a good compromise for both of us, and it ensures a fair deal for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price in between his last offer and my previous offer.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize ""fair deal"" and ""good compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Potential for Acceptance:** $15,500 is only $500 below my desired price, making it a potentially attractive option for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal Flexibility:**  It demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain Control:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target while leaving room for final negotiation.
* **Maximize Profit:** By pushing for $15,500, I'm trying to secure a sale closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $13500. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Limited Upside:**  There is limited room for negotiation to reach a price that meets my minimum.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is a better outcome than risking a further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's more prudent to avoid further negotiations with Bob that might result in a lower price or a breakdown in the deal."
