"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $10500? That's a compromise that still gives you a good discount, but also recognizes the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10250? That's still a good discount, but also recognizes the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
