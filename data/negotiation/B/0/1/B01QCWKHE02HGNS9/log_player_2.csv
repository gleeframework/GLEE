"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He'll try to negotiate a lower price."

This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to gain something from this transaction. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not satisfied with the price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,125,000. While it's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget and closer to his previous counteroffer. If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  It's a better deal than buying from John, so Bob should accept."
