Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting her offer and forcing her to sell to John.

**The Sweet Spot:** Alice needs to find a price that's tempting to Bob (significantly higher than his $1,000,000 valuation) but doesn't cut too deeply into her potential profit.

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  I know you've been looking for something like this, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Profitable for Alice:**  Alice secures a $350,000 profit, which is a significant portion of her maximum potential profit ($500,000).
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob gets the product for $350,000 less than its value to him. This is a substantial saving and a strong incentive to accept.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Alice could try negotiating even higher, but she increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
