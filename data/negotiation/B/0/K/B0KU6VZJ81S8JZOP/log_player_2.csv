"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $9,500 is more than his budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $9,000?  This price reflects the product's value and gives you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely get a better price with more negotiation.  He should try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but my max is $8,750.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement here.  $8,750 is very close, but I need to get a little closer to my desired price point. Would you be willing to go up to $8,900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $8,900 is getting closer to his budget, he can likely still get a better price. He should counteroffer again, trying to push for a price closer to $8,750."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your price point, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. $8,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,850? This would be a final compromise from my side. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. While $8,850 is a good price, it's still above his budget. He's already had 6 rounds of negotiation and hasn't been able to get Alice down to his target price. It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a better deal, and buying from John at $8,000 is the most sensible option."
