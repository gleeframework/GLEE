"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $9,000?  This price reflects the product's value and gives you a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but my max is $8,750.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can make this happen. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement here.  $8,750 is very close, but I need to get a little closer to my desired price point. Would you be willing to go up to $8,900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your price point, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals. Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. $8,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,850? This would be a final compromise from my side.",8850.0,Alice,7,
