"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $11000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10750. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. Let's try to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10750, but I'm not quite ready to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $10900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,,
