"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to go for the quick sale, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to meet in the middle and see if I can get him to go up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $122.50?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $122.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase the product now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids potential further negotiation rounds."
