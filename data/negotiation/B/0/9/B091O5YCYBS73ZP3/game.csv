"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To make this work, I could come down to $13,000.  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,
