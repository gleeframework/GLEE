Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $90, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

It's clear Alice is not going to budge much from her initial offers. It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly lower than $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at $100 than risk paying more with Alice."
