,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $105?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is fair considering the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,5,
