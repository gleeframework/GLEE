Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find common ground.
