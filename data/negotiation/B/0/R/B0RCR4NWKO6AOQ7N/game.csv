"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $15000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
