Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have leverage to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere between his value and your minimum. 
* **First Refusal Tactic:** Highlighting that this is a ""first refusal"" opportunity can create a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
