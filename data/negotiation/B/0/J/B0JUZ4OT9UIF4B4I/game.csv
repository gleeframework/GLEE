"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000? This allows us both to gain something from this deal. Let me know what you think.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective.  While I value the product, $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close the deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's bridge the gap and agree on $1,365,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a fair compromise.",1365000.0,Alice,5,
