"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me some room for negotiation and maximizes my potential profit.  I'm also trying to establish a positive tone and emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet. I believe I can push for a higher amount. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still securing a profitable sale. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose an alternative. I am willing to pay $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my initial goal of $800,000 and is a good deal.  This is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
