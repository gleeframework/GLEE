"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget of $8,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he's still willing to go lower. He's got plenty of rounds left to negotiate and should continue pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $9,250. This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer it to you for $10250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue rejecting Alice's offers. He is still $2,250 over his budget and he has plenty of rounds to negotiate. Even if John's offer is secure, Bob can afford to continue the negotiation process and try to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,250 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $10100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Bob could continue to negotiate, Alice's offer of $10,100 is still significantly above his budget. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice to budge much lower. It's more advantageous to take John's offer of $8,000 and secure the product within his budget."
