Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $2,000,000. I believe it has immense value and could be a game-changer for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1500000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the same as what John is willing to pay.  I'm going to accept it. While I'd love to get more, it's not worth risking losing the deal completely."
