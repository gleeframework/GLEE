"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $95. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob can get the product from John for $80, he should choose to buy from John."
