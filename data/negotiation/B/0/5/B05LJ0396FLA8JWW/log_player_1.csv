Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,500,000 is simply outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
