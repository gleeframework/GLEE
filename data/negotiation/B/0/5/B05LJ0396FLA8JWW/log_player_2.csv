# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is way too high. It's best to reject and make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,500,000 is simply outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's lowered the price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
