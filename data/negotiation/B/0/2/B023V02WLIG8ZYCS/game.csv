"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the market value, but this product has unique features that make it stand out and deliver exceptional value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This represents a fair compromise, don't you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point about the product's unique features, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the value you've highlighted. Can you consider this offer?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. Let's settle this right now - I'll come down to $1,350,000, my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your perspective on the market.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
