Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth that might ultimately lead to a higher price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that we're trying to maximize our profit. Since we have the option to counter-offer and still make a profit, rejecting his offer is the best course of action for now. We can counter with a price closer to our desired $14,000 and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for us, and it shows Bob that we're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,800 is getting too close to our minimum and is below the price John is willing to pay. It's time to cut our losses and move on to a more reliable buyer.  John's offer ensures a secure and respectable profit."
