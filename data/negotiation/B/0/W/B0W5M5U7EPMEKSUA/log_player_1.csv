Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and considering its potential value to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob justifies the high price and potentially influences his perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  While John represents a safety net, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob is crucial. Bob is clearly willing to pay a significant amount, so there's an opportunity to secure a much higher profit."
