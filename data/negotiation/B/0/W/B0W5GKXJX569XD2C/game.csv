"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think it's still a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? It's still a great deal for a product like this, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let's make this happen!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
