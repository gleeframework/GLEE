"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer represents a considerable investment from your side, but I am confident the product's ROI will justify it.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
