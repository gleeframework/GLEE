"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to subtly remind him of the potential benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I'd like to propose a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $85 is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing the waters:** By rejecting, I can see if Bob is truly willing to go higher or if he's just trying to get the best possible deal for himself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit above that price point.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us and it would allow me to sell the product while still getting a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** By offering $92.50, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair price for both of us"" subtly reinforces the value proposition for Bob.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** This price still allows me to make a profit while showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $87.50 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $87.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, it's not likely that further negotiation will lead to a significantly higher price.
* **Secure the sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and ensures I don't lose out to John's offer."
