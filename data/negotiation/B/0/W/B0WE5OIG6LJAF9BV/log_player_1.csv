Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. How about $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I need to sell the product for at least $80 to make a profit, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is getting closer to my minimum price of $80, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would allow me to sell the product at my minimum price while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
