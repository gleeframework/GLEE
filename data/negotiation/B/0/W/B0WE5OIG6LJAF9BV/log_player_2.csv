"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would allow me to sell the product at my minimum price while still giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

At this point, Alice's offer matches the price from John. There's no benefit to further negotiation."
