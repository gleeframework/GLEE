Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm willing to let it go for $149.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's the guaranteed price from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above the $150 fallback.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $149 feels like a ""deal"" compared to a rounded $150, potentially making Bob more receptive. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept any offer above $80. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
