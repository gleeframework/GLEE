"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $142.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",142.5,Alice,5,
