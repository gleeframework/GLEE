Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy involved:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is polite and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:** While this response provides a strong starting point, researching typical markups for similar products in your industry is essential. This will help you determine a realistic but ambitious price range.
* **Bob's personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust your approach accordingly. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards during the negotiation process, but you can't go higher than your initial offer."
