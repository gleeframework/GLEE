"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still allows me to get a fair price for the product, while hopefully being a price you can work with. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer to my asking price, I still need to ensure I get a fair deal.  How about $1,225,000? This is a reasonable compromise that hopefully addresses both our needs.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations. While $1,190,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. To finalize this deal, I need to be at $1,210,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my expenses.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly very intent on staying above $1,200,000. We've slowly been moving closer, and this offer is a decent compromise. Continuing to push risks her walking away or not budging further.  This price also provides a significant savings compared to John's offer."
