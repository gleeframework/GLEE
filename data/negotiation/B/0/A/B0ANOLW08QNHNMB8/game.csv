"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's tempting, I'm looking to spend closer to $10500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a good compromise and still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go up to $10750, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $10875. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",10875.0,Alice,5,
