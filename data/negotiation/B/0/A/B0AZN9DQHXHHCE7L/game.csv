"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value to me and what you need to get for it. Let's make a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, and we could finally close this deal.  ",9000.0,Alice,5,
