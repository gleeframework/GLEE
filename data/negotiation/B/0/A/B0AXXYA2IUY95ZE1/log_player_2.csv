"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm excited to consider Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, I'm not sure if she's willing to go lower. However, I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and buying from John for $800,000 would be a significant discount.

Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
