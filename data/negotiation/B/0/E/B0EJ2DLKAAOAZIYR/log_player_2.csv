"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but I can potentially get a better deal. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a lower price."
