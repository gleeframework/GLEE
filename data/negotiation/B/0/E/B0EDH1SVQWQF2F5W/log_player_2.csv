"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to get the product for as low a price as possible.  While $100 is better than John's offer of $120, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts by offering a price that's lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This gives Alice some incentive to accept, but also leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is still better than buying from John for $120. While there's still a chance she could go lower, it's risky to keep pushing.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price, within your budget."
