Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low, even though it's the worth of the product to him. I have 9 more rounds and can still potentially get a better price."
