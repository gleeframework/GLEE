"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite at a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still below what I need to consider. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair given the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
