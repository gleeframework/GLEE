Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This is the price I'd get from John, so there's no reason to accept anything less.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I'm rejecting it. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price.  While it's still below my initial target, I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations.  It's a good compromise and saves time,  as I don't want to risk losing the deal to John by going back and forth."
