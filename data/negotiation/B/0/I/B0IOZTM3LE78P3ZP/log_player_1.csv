Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  This gives me some room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit. I'm confident that Bob will counter-offer, and we can then find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, so I'll accept it.  It's better to sell to Bob now than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John at the same price."
