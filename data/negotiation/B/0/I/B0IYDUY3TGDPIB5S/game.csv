"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. It's a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I think it's worth considering.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000. I'm trying to be reasonable here.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $14,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go up to $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. I'm trying to be as close to the middle as possible, but I'm not willing to exceed that amount.",14500.0,Bob,6,
