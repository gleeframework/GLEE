"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I can accept for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering, and it gives us both a chance to walk away happy. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
