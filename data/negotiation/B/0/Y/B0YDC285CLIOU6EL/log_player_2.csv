Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I can accept for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering, and it gives us both a chance to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
