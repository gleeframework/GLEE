$400,000 is a great price, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get it lower."

I'm going to start with a lowball offer to see how Alice reacts.  I think $200,000 is a fair starting point, given my budget."

Alice is still too high. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to worry that this is going to drag on."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While I'd still like to get it lower, Alice is clearly not going to budge much further.  It's getting close to my budget, and I don't want to risk losing the product to John.  I'm going to accept the offer."
