Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your worth:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to you, so you don't want to sell it for less.
* **Start high:** It's always better to start with a higher price and negotiate down. Bob might be willing to pay more than $12,000, especially if he thinks it's a good deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering $18,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price that's beneficial for both of you. 
* **Time factor:**  Mentioning listing it publicly creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to decide quicker.

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If he rejects your offer outright, you always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
