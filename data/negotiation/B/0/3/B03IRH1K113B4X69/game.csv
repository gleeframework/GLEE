"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value justifies a price higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still above my budget.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $13,000. I believe this is a fair price, and it's closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you've made concessions, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Given my budget and our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer $13,500. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,7,
