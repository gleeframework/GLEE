Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is a bit lower than what I think it's worth to Bob, but still gives me a good profit. This will hopefully make him more likely to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is still a decent profit for me, I think I can get closer to Bob's value of $150. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $110? It's still a good price considering what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
