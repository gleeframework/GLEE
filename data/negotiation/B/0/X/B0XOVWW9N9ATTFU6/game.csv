"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I believe the product is worth. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,000,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
