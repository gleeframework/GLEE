Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.  
* **Creating a Sense of Exclusivity:** By mentioning that this is an exclusive offer before you go to other buyers, you might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're still in a strong position to negotiate down to a price that's more appealing to him while still remaining above your minimum."
