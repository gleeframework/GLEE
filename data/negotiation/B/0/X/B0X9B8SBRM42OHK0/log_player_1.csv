Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, attempting to sell to Bob first at a higher price could increase my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that sits comfortably between Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly could save me the time and effort of going to John.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
