Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This will hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate further."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $9,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but am still trying to save money. Hopefully, this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."

Alice's offer is still too high for me. It's closer to my budget, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'd rather go with John and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
