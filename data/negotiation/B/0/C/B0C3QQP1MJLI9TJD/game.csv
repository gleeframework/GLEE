"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $98.",98.0,Alice,5,
