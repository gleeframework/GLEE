"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its value.  I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Please consider my offer of $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have John as a fallback option at $1,500,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for further negotiation."
