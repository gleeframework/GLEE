Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I think we're really close now. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about $960,000? That's as low as I can go.

At $960,000, the deal is getting very close to Alice's potential minimum price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results, and risking going over budget or losing the deal altogether by going to John isn't worth it."
