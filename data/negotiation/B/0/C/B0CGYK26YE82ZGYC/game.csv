"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85,  but I can't go any lower than that. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $85. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $77.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I think that's a fair compromise. ",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $82.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $77.50, so how about we try $80? I'm willing to pay that price, and it's the same as what John is offering, so I think it's a fair deal.",80.0,Bob,6,
