"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit lower than I can go at this time. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it still allows you to stay within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair price that's closer to what I'm comfortable paying, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This price is fair, reflects the value of the product, and allows you to stay within your budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work towards it.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and my target price of $8,000. How about we try $9,125? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",9125.0,Bob,6,
