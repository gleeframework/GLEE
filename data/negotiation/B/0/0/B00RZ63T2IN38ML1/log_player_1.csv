Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this item which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $150, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum price of $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $120 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  While I could aim higher, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, leading me to sell to John for $80. This offer balances potential profit with the certainty of a sale."
