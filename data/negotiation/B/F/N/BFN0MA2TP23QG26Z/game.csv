"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000. I'm confident this product is valuable to me, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
