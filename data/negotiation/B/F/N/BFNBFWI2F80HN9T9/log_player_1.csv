Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as it's more than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
