"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, and it's close to my minimum. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, at $12250.  This is a significant price reduction from my original asking price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is the price I'm willing to go up to. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
