"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's close to my minimum. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum ($15,000) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I highlight the ""great deal"" for him, emphasizing the value he'll get.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I acknowledge that my offer is ""close to my minimum,"" implying I'm open to some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 8 rounds left, and there's room for both of us to compromise.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While $15,000 is my ideal, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a huge loss. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I've dropped my price from $14,000 to $13,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This is still above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:** I emphasize that $13,000 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" acknowledging his perspective while still maintaining my own.
* **Urge Bob to close the deal:** I use phrases like ""significant discount"" and ""hoping we can close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $11,500 is still below my minimum price of $15,000, and I'm not willing to sell the product at such a significant discount.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** There are 6 rounds left, and there's still potential for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable backup plan.

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous one, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, at $12,250.  This is a significant price reduction from my original asking price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($11,500). This shows I'm serious about negotiating and reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I use phrases like ""meeting you halfway"" and ""significant price reduction"" to highlight the concessions I'm making.
* **Mutual benefit:**  I reiterate that I'm aiming for a solution ""that works for both of us,"" reinforcing the idea of a fair and balanced deal.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to selling to John. With 5 rounds remaining, I have some room to keep pushing, but I'll need to weigh the potential gain against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is the price I'm willing to go up to. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $12,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Limited time:** We're down to 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. 
* **Better than selling to John:** While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,000 is a decent outcome, especially considering the limited time remaining. 

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
