"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my spending limit.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. This price allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a good return on your investment.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  However, $10,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is your final offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",10700.0,Alice,9,
