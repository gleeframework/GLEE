"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I can do $13500, which is a compromise, but still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $14000, which is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. It's a great deal for both of us!",14000.0,Alice,5,
