"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $1,000,000 from her.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's time to see if you can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $950,000 demonstrates your seriousness in getting a lower price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still worth trying to get a lower price.  You have 7 more rounds, so you have time to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown flexibility by dropping her price.  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on her to reduce the price further while still being within your budget.  It's a reasonable increment towards her last offer, making it less likely she'll reject it outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still slightly above your ideal price, and you have 5 more rounds to negotiate. It's worth seeing if you can push her down further.  It's possible she's more willing to compromise as the rounds go by, especially if she sees you're serious about not exceeding your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final offer.  It's at your maximum price point, and since you have 4 rounds remaining, it's a good time to see if Alice will accept it.  It also sends a strong signal that you're not willing to go higher, which might encourage her to take the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only offering $10,000 less than what John is offering. With only three rounds left, it's highly unlikely Alice will drop her price any further to meet your budget. You have a guaranteed deal with John at your maximum price point, so it's time to take it and avoid further negotiation."
