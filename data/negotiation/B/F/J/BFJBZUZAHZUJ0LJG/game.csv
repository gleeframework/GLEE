"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
