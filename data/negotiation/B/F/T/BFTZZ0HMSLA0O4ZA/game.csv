"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my desired price. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll agree it's fair.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,450,000.  This is a competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
