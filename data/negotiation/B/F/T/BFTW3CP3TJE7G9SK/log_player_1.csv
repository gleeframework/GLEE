"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, as it's better to start high and negotiate down than to start low and risk leaving money on the table.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to offer a counter-price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  $950,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer, and I'm hoping to close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $975,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $960,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds left.  There's a risk that if I reject the offer and counter, Bob might walk away and I would be forced to sell to John for a lower price."
