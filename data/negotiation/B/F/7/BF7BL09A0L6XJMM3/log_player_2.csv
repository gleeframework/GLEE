Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.

Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
