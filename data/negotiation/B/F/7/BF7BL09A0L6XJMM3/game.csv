"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. That's a significant offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a significant offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
