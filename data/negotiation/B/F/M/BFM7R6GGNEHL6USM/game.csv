"Bob, I have a product that I believe holds immense value, and I'm confident it could be a game-changer for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. This reflects the unique potential I see in this product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
