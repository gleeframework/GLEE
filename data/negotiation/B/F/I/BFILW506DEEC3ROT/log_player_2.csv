"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
