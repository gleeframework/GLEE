"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to my minimum.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within the first few rounds and have room to negotiate.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while also still leaving some room for negotiation. It also keeps me closer to my minimum price and less reliant on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within the early rounds and have room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm sticking with a firm price of $10,000. This is my minimum and it's a fair compromise considering Bob's counteroffers. This is a key moment in the negotiation as I'm putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision. If he rejects this offer, I have the option to sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm getting worried that Bob will continue to lower his offer, and I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiations.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
