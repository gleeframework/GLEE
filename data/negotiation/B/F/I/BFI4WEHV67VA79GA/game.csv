"That's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can do $110, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product, which is closer to my original offer and a fair compromise. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,105.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $105, which is a bit higher than your latest offer, but still a compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,,
