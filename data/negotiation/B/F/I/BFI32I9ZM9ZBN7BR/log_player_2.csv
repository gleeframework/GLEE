Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  Let's try $105. I'm confident this product will be a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105, and it's getting too risky to continue the negotiation.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John, which is a better outcome than potentially overpaying in later rounds."
