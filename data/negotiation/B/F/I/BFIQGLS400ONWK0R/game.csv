"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still leaving some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's work together to find a solution.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,750. This is still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,
