Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($1,200,000) sets a strong anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your $800,000 baseline.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" reinforcing the idea that the price is justified. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", you leave room for Bob to counter-offer, initiating a negotiation where you can still aim for a price above your minimum. 

**Important:** While John offers a safety net, aiming higher with Bob increases your potential profit."
