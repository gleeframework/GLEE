"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and holds significant value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,500,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000, so I'm offering $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product's unique value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,425,000? This would ensure a good deal for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,425,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
