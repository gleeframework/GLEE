"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I have a few more rounds to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and holds significant value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,500,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000, so I'm offering $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While getting closer to my goal, $1,350,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirement.  I'm confident that I can push for a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation, or I can always sell to John for my desired amount."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product's unique value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,425,000? This would ensure a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,425,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but it's clear Bob is not willing to go higher.  I've already rejected his last two offers, and with only a few rounds left, I don't think I can get a better price.  I'm going to take the safe bet and sell to John for $1,500,000."
