Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and holds significant value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product's unique value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,425,000?
