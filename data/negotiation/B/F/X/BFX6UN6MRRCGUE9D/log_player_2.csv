"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe is fair for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, you can do better. Rejecting this offer might lead to a counter-offer from Alice closer to her $8,000 value. If not, you can always buy from John for $10,000."
