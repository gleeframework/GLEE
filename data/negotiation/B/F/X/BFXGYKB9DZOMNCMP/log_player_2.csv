"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, and I'm willing to pay up to $15,000. A counteroffer of $10,000 is a good starting point. This price is significantly lower than Alice's offer and leaves room for negotiation.  It's a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her price slightly to $12,500.  While this is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. It's also likely that further negotiation will only result in a small reduction in price, which may not be worth the extra time and effort.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
