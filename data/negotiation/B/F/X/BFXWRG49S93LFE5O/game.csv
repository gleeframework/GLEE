"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000? This still leaves room for profit for you, and it's closer to the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finalize the deal soon. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I hope we can come to an agreement on this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
