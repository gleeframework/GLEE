"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high. You have a good amount of negotiation room and should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $550000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is significantly lower than her initial offer and puts you in a good position. Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John and leaves you with a good deal.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she could walk away or counteroffer at a higher price, jeopardizing the potential savings."
