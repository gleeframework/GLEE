Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get at least $1,000,000 from John, so I'm aiming higher.
* **Potential gain:** By offering $1,500,000, I have the potential to earn an extra $500,000 if Bob accepts.
* **Risk assessment:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm comfortable with this risk because I have a guaranteed sale to John as a fallback.

This offer balances the potential for maximum profit with the security of a guaranteed sale."
