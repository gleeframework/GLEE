"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  I believe this price is fair and mutually beneficial. Please consider this offer carefully.  If you decline, I have a backup buyer ready to purchase the product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, it's still lower than what John is selling for. 
* **You save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll accept.  It's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product at a lower price than your alternative."
