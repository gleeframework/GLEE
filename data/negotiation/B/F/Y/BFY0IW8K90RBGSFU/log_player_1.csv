Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me is only $1,500,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to sell the product, I can't afford to drop that low right now. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counter-offer and see if we can bridge the remaining gap."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the best option at this point."
