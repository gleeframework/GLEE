,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $85, which was my previous offer, so I'll go with $87.50. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for the product.",87.5,Bob,4,
