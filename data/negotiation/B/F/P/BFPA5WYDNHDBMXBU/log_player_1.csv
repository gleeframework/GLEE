Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the deal. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
