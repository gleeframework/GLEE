"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1150000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's aim for a quick resolution.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down to $1250000.  That's getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal now.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
