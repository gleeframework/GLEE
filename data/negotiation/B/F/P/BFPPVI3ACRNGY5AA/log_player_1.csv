Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the value to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I know I can always settle for $1,000,000 with John if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is still a good price for Bob, and it's closer to my desired price.  I think this will be a good middle ground for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I think I can get a better deal with further negotiation, and if not, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,000,000. This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept this price, but if Bob doesn't agree, I'll sell to John. This way, I ensure I get a price that's worth it to me."
