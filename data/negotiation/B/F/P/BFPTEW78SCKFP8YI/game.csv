"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
