Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I really like the product, but I would need to stick to my maximum of $80. Could you possibly lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly fixed on his $80 budget and unwilling to budge.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with him as it's unlikely he'll move closer to your minimum price.  It's better to take John's guaranteed offer of $100."
