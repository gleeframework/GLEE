"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still very attractive to you, considering the significant value this product holds for your business. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,980000.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $980000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $980000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1015000. This price still reflects a significant value for you and leaves room for both of us to gain from this deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1015000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,990000.0
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1015000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, which is my absolute maximum for this deal. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",990000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $990000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1000000. This price reflects a significant value for you and is a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm getting close to my maximum, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $985000, which is my last offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",985000.0,Bob,8,,
