Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below the product's value to him. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing negotiations.  I'll use this round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my maximum, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $985000, which is my last offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.
