"Bob, thanks for your patience with this negotiation.  I'm motivated to find a price that works for both of us, but I have to be firm.  $1,075,000 is too low for me to consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
