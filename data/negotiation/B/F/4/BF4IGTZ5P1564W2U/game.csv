"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I propose an initial price of $1,200,000. This is a special offer considering the high demand and limited availability of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the unique features and benefits of our product, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $1,150,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's value, but it aims to bridge the gap between our positions.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while still being within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Bob. To continue our discussion, I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This offers a slight increase from your last offer, while still maintaining a reasonable discount from the product's value. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of your product while staying within my budget.  Let's reach a deal now.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
