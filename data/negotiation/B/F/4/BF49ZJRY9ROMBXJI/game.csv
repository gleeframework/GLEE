"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to go up to $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the value I believe it holds.",110.0,Alice,3,
