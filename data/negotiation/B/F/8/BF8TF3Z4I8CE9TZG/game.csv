"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the immense value it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite let it go for that price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,000,000 even? This reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counter with $990,000. I think this is the highest I can go without sacrificing too much of my budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,
