"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum value I can see for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe the product's value is worth a premium, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and pay $925,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's work together to make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $925,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $975,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000. I'm starting to feel like we're in the final stretch here. Let's see if we can wrap this up.",955000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $955,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to meet you at $940,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and move forward.",940000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $945,000. I'm not going to get any closer than that, so let's see if we can finalize the deal.",945000.0,Alice,9,
