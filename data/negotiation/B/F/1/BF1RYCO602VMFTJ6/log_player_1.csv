"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a quick deal. If he rejects, I'll have room to negotiate downwards. However, I'm keeping a close eye on the 10 round limit and the opportunity to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a huge loss.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit below that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,025,000 is still a little too low for me. I want to try to squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a deal in the next few rounds.  However, with only 6 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. We're getting closer to a deal, but time is running out. I need to find a balance between getting the best price and closing the deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,040,000, but I'm still a bit below that. How about we try $1,015,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and even though Bob is getting closer, we're still $5,000 apart.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  While I would have liked to get a little more, I can't afford to gamble on this negotiation."
