The product is worth no more than $100 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  We'll see if she's willing to come down that much."
