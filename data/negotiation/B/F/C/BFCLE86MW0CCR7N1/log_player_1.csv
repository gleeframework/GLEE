"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is still profitable for me, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm starting high, knowing I have room to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything below my minimum of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $90?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $82.50? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's slightly higher than his previous offer. I'm sticking to my minimum price of $120 and will continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $82.50 is still far from what I need. How about $95? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still sticking to a price that is profitable for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offers are still way below my minimum. It's getting increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  I'm better off selling to John for $120, which is a guaranteed profit."
