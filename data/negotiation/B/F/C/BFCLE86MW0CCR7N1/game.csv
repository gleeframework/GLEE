"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $90?  That way we both get a fair deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $82.50? That's the most I'm willing to pay.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $82.50 is still far from what I need. How about $95? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,6,
