"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves me with a profit of $15."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to get a little closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $110.  This is a compromise, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $108 is very close and a better outcome than selling to John."
