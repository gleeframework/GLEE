"Hi Bob, I understand you think $12500 is a fair price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $13250. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $12000, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you.",13250.0,Alice,3,
