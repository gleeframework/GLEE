{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($150), but it's also a price that Bob might be willing to pay, considering he values the product at $80. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. I can potentially meet him halfway or even go a little lower if necessary.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fall through. This gives me leverage to hold firm on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $90 is still below my minimum value of $150, and I'm not desperate to sell it at that price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle, or I can push for a higher price. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $150 gives me a strong bargaining position. This allows me to potentially extract a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $105?  This would still give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  $105 is a midpoint between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Deal:**  I'm emphasizing that $105 is still a fair deal for both of us, potentially appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $105 is still above my minimum value of $150, which means I'm not losing out on the deal. 
* **Leverage:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $150, which keeps my leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $105, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $97.50 is getting closer to my minimum value of $150, it's still significantly lower. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm not yet desperate to sell and there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, I can try to get a better price from Bob or potentially even sell to John for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $150 from John, which gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $101.25?  It's closer to your offer, but still allows us to both get a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $101.25 is almost exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($97.50). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message includes a sense of urgency (""Let's make this happen!"") to potentially incentivize Bob to accept.
* **John as Backstop:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $150, giving me leverage to hold out for a better deal if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already told you, I'm not willing to go above $97.50. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value is only $150 to you. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $97.50 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has made it clear he won't budge on his price of $97.50. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a higher price than Bob's offer, which is just above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially missing out on the higher price from John.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid potentially getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to compromise significantly."
