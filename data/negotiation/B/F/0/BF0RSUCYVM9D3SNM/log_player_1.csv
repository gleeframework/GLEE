"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, reflecting the value I place on the product. It allows for potential negotiation and gives me room to come down if necessary.  It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is not a bad deal, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept, but still leaving room for further negotiation."

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still confident I can do better.  I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a higher price."

I'm narrowing the gap further, but still aiming for a price that reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but I'm not giving in completely yet."
