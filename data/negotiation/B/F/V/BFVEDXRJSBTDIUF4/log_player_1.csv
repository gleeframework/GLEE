``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum. It shows you're willing to negotiate, while also setting a firm starting point."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if we can reach a better deal, but I'm not willing to accept his low offer at this stage.  There's still room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for less than $11,000. I believe we can still find a deal that's fair for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep talking.  $10,500 still isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident I can get my minimum price from him."
