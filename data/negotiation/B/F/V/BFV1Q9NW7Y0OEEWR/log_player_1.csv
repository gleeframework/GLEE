Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while leaving you with a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
