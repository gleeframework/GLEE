"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while leaving you with a good profit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
