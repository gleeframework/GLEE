Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downward. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could try for more, going too high might make Bob feel like you're trying to take advantage of him. This could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
