"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are trying to save money, so rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best option in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to save money, and $115 is still more than you're willing to pay. Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $110. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. I'm willing to come down to $112.50, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $112.50. This is still a bit more than your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your limit of $120. Continuing to negotiate risks either getting stuck at a higher price or running out of rounds and having to buy from John at $120. It's more advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's still within your budget."
