"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's still a bit too high for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget. While I understand your value for the product, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this point. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
