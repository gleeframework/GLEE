"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, the  $1,400,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,650,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,500,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
