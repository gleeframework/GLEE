It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $950,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is now offering closer to my initial desired price, but I can still try to get a better deal. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

This is a good price considering Alice's initial offer.  It's a decent saving from John's price, and I'm still within my budget. Time is also a factor, and continuing to negotiate could lead to further delays."
