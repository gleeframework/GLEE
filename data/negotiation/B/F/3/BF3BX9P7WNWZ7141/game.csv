"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This represents a significant step for me, and I hope it's a price we can both agree on.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $975,000, but that's my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
