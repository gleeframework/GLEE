"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15000 to me, and I know you're interested in it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering its value and the fact that I have another buyer lined up for $15000. Let me know your thoughts!",16000.0,Alice,1,
