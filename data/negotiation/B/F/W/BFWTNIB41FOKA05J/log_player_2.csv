Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I can do $9,250, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,250.  While she *might* still come down a bit, it's getting risky. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. It's better to secure a reasonable deal with John than to risk getting a price closer to $10,000 from Alice or potentially losing the deal altogether if negotiations stall."
