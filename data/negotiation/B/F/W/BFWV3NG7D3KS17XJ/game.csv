"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I place on this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's find a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is the closest I can get to your target without compromising my own value. Let's see if this is a deal we can shake on.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit off from your offer. I can go up to $975,000. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I think we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is just $5,000 above your latest offer. I'm not willing to go any higher, so this is my final counteroffer. Let's see if we can wrap up the deal.",980000.0,Alice,7,
