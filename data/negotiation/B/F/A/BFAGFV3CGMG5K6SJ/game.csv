"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,800 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,200? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Alice,5,
