Round 9

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has consistently rejected offers below $11,000 and is unlikely to move significantly in the last round.  While continuing negotiations for one more round is tempting, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of Alice remaining firm. Buying from John at $15,000, while not ideal, ensures you get the product and avoids the possibility of a stalemate with Alice leading to a missed opportunity."
