{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value the product offers Bob, making it more enticing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, as this keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer and will use that as a benchmark to decide whether to accept any of Bob's counteroffers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting it with the potential for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:**  The subsequent offers will depend on Bob's responses and the overall negotiation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is interested, his offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I can potentially secure a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000?  This price still leaves some room for you to get a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $11,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again highlighting the value for Bob to incentivize him.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter again, showing flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I show I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Increase the price:** $11,000 is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer.
* **Keep negotiations alive:** This counteroffer invites further discussion and potentially leads to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiation breaking down is high. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Even though $10,500 is not my ideal price, it's still a decent deal and prevents the risk of losing the sale altogether, as I can always sell to John for $15,000.

**In this scenario, accepting Bob's offer offers the best balance of risk and reward.**"
