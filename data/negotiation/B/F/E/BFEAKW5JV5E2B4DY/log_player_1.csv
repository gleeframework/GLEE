Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I see you're still looking for a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $850,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.
