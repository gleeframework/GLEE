Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to keep the cost within $12,000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,000 is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I've had enough negotiation rounds, and I don't see Bob coming up to my desired price. It's time to secure a sale with John and get the best price for my product."
