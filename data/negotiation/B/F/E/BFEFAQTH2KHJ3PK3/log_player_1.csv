Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($150). This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $175 is still less than the price John would pay, so I have some flexibility if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better price:** I can still potentially get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $150, which is my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows willingness to negotiate and could increase the likelihood of a deal. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $140 is still higher than what I'd get from John, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, making it more likely he'll be willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come up in price. I could end up with a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Time factor:**  While John is a sure bet for $150, continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time, and I might miss out on other opportunities.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision, considering the potential downsides of further negotiation and the time it might take."
