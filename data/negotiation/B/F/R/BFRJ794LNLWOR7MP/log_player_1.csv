Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn even more.  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $20,000 offer isn't set in stone. If Bob counters, we can negotiate down towards a price that's still very profitable for us, potentially exceeding the $15,000 backup offer.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without directly referencing Bob's potential use or our minimum acceptable price. This keeps the negotiation power in our court.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have some flexibility in our negotiation and that Bob doesn't find the initial offer unreasonable enough to walk away immediately."
