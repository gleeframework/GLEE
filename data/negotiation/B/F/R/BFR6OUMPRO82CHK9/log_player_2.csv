"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be of great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is less than your maximum price, you can potentially get a better deal. John's offer of $150 sets your upper limit, so there's room to negotiate with Alice or see if other sellers offer a better price."
