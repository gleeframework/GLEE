Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my perceived value of the product, but I'm also open to negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to what I believe the product is worth.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
