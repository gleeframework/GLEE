"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a good value for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. How about we split the difference and settle on $787,500? This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",787500.0,Alice,5,
