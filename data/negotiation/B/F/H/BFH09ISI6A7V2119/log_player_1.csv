"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell quickly, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,000?  That's still a great price for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's keep this going! I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good price for such a valuable product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but $14,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm not sure if we're getting any closer.  I'm going to make a counteroffer to see if we can finally come to an agreement."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob, the negotiations have gone on for too long, and I'm not sure we'll ever reach an agreement.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
