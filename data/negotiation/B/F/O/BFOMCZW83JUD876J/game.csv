"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering the value it brings me. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value the product offers me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
