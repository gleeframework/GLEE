Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price, given its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable margin:**  The $1,200,000 price gives me a good profit, while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Open communication:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I have a good chance to improve on Bob's offer. 
* **John as a safety net:** I know I can get $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target while still being attractive to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $900,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strong justification:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Open to further discussion:** The message is positive and encourages continued negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider his response and decide whether to accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying. Can we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $975,000 is closer to my target, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  I've already established a range of $900,000 - $1,100,000 with Bob, so there's a chance I can get him to come up further with another counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000. This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer again:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target but still reasonable for both of us.  I'll need to carefully assess whether it's better to push for more or accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $975,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's aim for $1,050,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This counteroffer is again a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This continues to show flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and invites Bob to continue the dialogue.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I will need to evaluate his response carefully. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll have to decide if I'm willing to go lower or if it's time to move on to John and secure the $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $975,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product holds. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate, with Bob refusing to go above $975,000, and me unwilling to go below $1,050,000. 
* **Significant difference:** The gap between our desired prices is still too large.  
* **John's offer:**  I know I can get a significantly higher price from John. This is a secure alternative.

**Next steps:**

* **End negotiations with Bob:**  I'll inform Bob that I'm no longer interested in continuing negotiations at his price.
* **Sell to John:**  I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring a much higher profit."
