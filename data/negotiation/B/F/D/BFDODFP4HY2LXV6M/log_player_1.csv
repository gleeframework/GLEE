Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards, if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a mild sense of urgency can encourage a quicker decision.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
