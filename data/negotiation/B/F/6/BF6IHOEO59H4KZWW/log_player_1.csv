"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a huge loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that gives me a decent profit. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is an improvement, it's still too low for me. I'm going to keep pushing for a better price.  There's a good chance Bob will raise his offer again if I don't settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price for this round.  I'm not going to lose any more ground. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$800,000 is a little closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping that Bob will come up a bit more in the next round. However, if he rejects my next offer, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate for a sale. With only three rounds remaining, I need to be strategic. If he rejects this, I'll likely accept John's offer."
