{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a strong negotiation position and shows my willingness to compromise.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget while leaving room for further negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. It's important to continue pushing for a lower price. The counteroffer is still within my budget, but it's important to try and get as close as possible to my maximum budget before having to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While I'm getting closer, there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer. It's at my maximum budget, so I'm not willing to go higher. If Alice rejects this, I'll buy from John. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. With only 3 rounds left, I'm unlikely to be able to negotiate her down to my target price. It's better to accept the guaranteed price from John rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
