"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $180 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $150? That's my absolute top price for this product.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $165. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $150.  It's the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",150.0,Bob,4,
