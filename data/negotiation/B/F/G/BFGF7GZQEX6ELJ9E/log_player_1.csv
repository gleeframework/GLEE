Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Starting with a significantly higher offer than your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing you at least $10,000. This empowers you to aim higher with Bob.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still making a profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and any additional information you gather during the negotiation."
