Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I have more rounds and the option to sell to John, so I'm willing to keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $9,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly my minimum price, and I've already used three rounds. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer, and I risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to take the guaranteed $10,000 and move on."
