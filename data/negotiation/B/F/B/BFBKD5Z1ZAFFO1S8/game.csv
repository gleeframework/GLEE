"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,4,
