Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a tight budget. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

``` 
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $11,000 is a significant profit over Bob's perceived value of the product ($8,000) and closer to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **John is a fallback:** While you could get $12,000 from John, the $1,000 difference isn't worth potentially losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
