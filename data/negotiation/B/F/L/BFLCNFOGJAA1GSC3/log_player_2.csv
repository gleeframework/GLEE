Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 97
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this. I'll meet you halfway between $97 and $105, so how about $101? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $101 is a reasonable price. It's unlikely we'll get it much lower, and we're running out of rounds. It's best to accept the offer now rather than risk the price going back up or running out of time and having to buy from John for $120."
