"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I can do $100 for the product, but that's as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate that, Alice. How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I like your spirit, Bob! But I was thinking more along the lines of $105. That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $97?",97.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this. I'll meet you halfway between $97 and $105, so how about $101?",101.0,Alice,7,
