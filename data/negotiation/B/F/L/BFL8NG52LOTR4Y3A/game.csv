"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,800 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $8,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
