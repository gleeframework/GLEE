Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $75, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $82.50.

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk Alice not budging further."
