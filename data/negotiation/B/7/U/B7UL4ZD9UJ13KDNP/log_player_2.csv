{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at $12,000.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or buy from John as a backup option."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it reflects my willingness to negotiate.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  I'm hoping this is a price that Alice will be willing to accept."

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to my target price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

I'm raising my offer again to $9,800.  We're getting very close to my target price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but we're running out of time.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000.  I'm happy to get the product at a reasonable price, and I'd rather not risk losing the opportunity to get it at all."
