Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).

Offering a price of $925,000 creates a potential profit scenario where:

* **You maximize profit:** You stand to make a significant $125,000 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Bob gets a deal:** Bob saves $75,000 compared to his perceived value. 

This strategy aims for a win-win while leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
