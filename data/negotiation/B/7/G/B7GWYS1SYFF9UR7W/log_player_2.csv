"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If you fail, you have the option to buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $105, which is the midpoint between my maximum budget of $100 and Alice's offer of $110. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107 is within my budget and a good compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and I risk losing the product to another buyer. Accepting her offer guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
