Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our values, considering the product's worth $10,000 to me and $15,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and selling to John is always an option, so I'm not in a rush to accept.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference between our last offers? I'm willing to come down to $15,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  We're getting closer, and while selling to John is always an option, I have 6 rounds left to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counteroffer Bob again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about $14,250? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle one more time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to our last four rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I don't want to risk losing a sale to John, and his offer is at my minimum.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
