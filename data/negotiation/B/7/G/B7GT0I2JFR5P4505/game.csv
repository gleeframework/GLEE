"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our values, considering the product's worth $10,000 to me and $15,000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference between our last offers? I'm willing to come down to $15,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering your value for the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your initial offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about $14,250? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's close this transaction.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle one more time.",13750.0,Bob,6,
