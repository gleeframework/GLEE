"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still quite high.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. There's no guarantee that John will sell out, and you can always go back to him if you don't get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but there is still room for negotiation. It is worth rejecting and trying to push for a lower price. You still have the option to buy from John if you don't reach a mutually agreeable deal with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects the value I see in it and is a fair offer for both of us.  I believe this is a good middle ground and a great opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $900,000 is a good deal for you, saving you $300,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might get you a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or you losing John as an option makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
