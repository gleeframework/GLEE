"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This sets a strong initial baseline and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above $1,300,000.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm optimistic that Bob will find this offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached a point where I'm not confident in getting a higher price from Bob. He's clearly not willing to budge much further.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a secure deal."
