Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still earn a good profit. It also sets the tone for a potentially lengthy negotiation, which is fine as long as I can get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can do better. I'm going to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price given the value of the product.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my target price,  continuing the negotiation is risky. I could potentially end up with a lower price or waste time, only to end up selling to John for $1,000,000. It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
