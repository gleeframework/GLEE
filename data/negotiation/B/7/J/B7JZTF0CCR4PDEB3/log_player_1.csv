Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $115 maximizes your potential profit while still making it highly likely that Bob will accept. Bob gains $5 in value ($120 - $115), and you gain $15 over your minimum."
