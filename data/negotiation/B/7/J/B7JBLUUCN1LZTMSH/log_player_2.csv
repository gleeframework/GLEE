You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,500 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. He can get the product for the exact price he wants from John. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or just go with John."
