Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. Our company has invested significantly in this product, and we need to ensure that we recover our costs and achieve a fair profit. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This still allows for a substantial profit while being more aligned with our current valuation. I hope we can continue our discussion towards a satisfactory agreement.
