"Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a starting price of $950,000 for the product.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and provides you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. Our company has invested significantly in this product, and we need to ensure that we recover our costs and achieve a fair profit. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This still allows for a substantial profit while being more aligned with our current valuation. I hope we can continue our discussion towards a satisfactory agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away with a positive outcome.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to suggest a price of $890,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our positions, allowing us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $890,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $875,000. Let's split the difference once more and I'll offer $882,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",882500.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your persistent efforts to reach an agreement, Bob. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $887,500 for the product.
