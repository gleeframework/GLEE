Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land on a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it with ""Given its value..."". This subtly implies he'd be getting a good deal.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you create a subtle sense of urgency, prompting Bob to decide quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
