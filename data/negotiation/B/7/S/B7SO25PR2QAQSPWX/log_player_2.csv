"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by you. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I am offering it to you for $140. This price reflects the value we place on maintaining high-quality standards while ensuring our customers receive a fair deal. I believe this offer will allow us both to benefit. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's maximum value for the product is $120. Alice's offer of $140 exceeds this limit.  While Alice's message attempts to justify the price, Bob can secure the same product from John for $120.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice for Bob to save money."
