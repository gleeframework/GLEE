"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a fair offer, I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This leaves room for both of us to gain value from this deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  $1,000,000 is a fair price for both of us.  This deal would be mutually beneficial, and I'm confident we can close it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
