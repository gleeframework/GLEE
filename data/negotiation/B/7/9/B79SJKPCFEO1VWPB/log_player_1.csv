{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product.  How about $890,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 6

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm running out of rounds and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure this deal than risk losing it altogether."
