"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000?  That still leaves a good margin for you to profit from this opportunity.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product.  How about $890,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
