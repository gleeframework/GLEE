Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. There's room for negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. Can you consider this revised offer?

It's getting close to the wire, and Bob is consistently increasing his offer. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more, accepting $1,275,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
