"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,
