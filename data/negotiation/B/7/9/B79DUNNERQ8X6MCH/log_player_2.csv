# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product.  While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still higher than your limit.  You can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
