"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is above Bob's value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum value.  I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering my minimum price of $120.  This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob and $120 to me. I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept and we can close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John as we are running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  We are down to our last four rounds, and Bob seems unwilling to meet my minimum price. While I would prefer a higher price, I need to guarantee I reach my minimum goal, and John is offering that."
