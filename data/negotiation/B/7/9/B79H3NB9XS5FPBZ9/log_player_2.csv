This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,750, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last effort to find a mutually beneficial price.
