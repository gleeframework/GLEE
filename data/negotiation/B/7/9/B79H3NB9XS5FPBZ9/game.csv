"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will benefit you greatly. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need a fair price, Alice, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. It's a reasonable price considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,750, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. My final offer is $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to secure a deal. Let's find a common ground and finalize this purchase.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price.",10250.0,Alice,9,
