"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still feel that $1100000 is a bit high for my current budget. I would like to counteroffer at $1050000. This is the maximum I can afford while staying within my financial limits.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1050000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. However, I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm counteroffering at $1075000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some additional benefits to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 6-month warranty. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price that's fair to both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
