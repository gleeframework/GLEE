"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, as I believe this price is still fair considering the value of the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but $1,000,000 is my bottom line.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
