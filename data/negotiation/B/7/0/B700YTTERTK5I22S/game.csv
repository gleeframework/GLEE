"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,300,000 is simply not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. This is my final offer, and it's a price that will ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,300,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
