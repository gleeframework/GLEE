Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a quality product at a price that's fair, and I get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can get closer to that value by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable settling for anything below $9,000.  There are only a few rounds left, so I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a good compromise for both of us - you get a great product for a fair price, and I get a price that's closer to what I need. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price again. However, $8900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, so I'm offering $8700. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I would have liked to get a bit more from Bob, we're running out of rounds and his offers are still too low. It's time to take the sure thing and secure a deal that meets my minimum price."
