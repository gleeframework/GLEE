Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get a bargain.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed win and avoids further negotiation."
