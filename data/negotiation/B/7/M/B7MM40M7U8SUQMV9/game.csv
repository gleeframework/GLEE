"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,450,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,525,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction.  What do you say?",1525000.0,Alice,5,
