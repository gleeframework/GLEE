"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation of its capabilities.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,650,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $1,100,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product could be beneficial.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
