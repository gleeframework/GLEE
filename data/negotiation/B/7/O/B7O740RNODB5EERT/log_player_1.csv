"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential value.  Since I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he has room to negotiate but still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $12,500 is a good deal for Bob, it's not enough for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate while allowing me to get a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $12,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm willing to risk losing a couple of rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial asking price.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $11,500 is tempting, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $12,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer but still leaves a reasonable profit for me. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will accept it.  If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiations have gone on for several rounds, and we're getting close to the price that John is offering.  There's a chance Bob might accept $11,000, but it's risky to keep going.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself a profit.  It's better to be safe than sorry."
