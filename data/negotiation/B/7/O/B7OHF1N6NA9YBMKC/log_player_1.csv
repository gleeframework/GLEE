Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. I'll think carefully about my next move...

I decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500, as it's still a significant discount from my initial price. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
