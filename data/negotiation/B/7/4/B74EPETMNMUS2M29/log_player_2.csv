It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get a better price than $110."

Alice's offer of $100 is still above your maximum price of $80, but it's getting closer.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a further counteroffer from Alice.  You're still saving $20 compared to buying from John."
