"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free service worth $1,500, and we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
