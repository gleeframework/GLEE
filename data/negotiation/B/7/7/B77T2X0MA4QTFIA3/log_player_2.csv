"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's within your budget, it's a significant markup from what the product is worth to Alice.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation, as you know the product's true value is lower. 
* **Saving money:** Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to secure a lower price.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, you'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and reflects the product's worth to her.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** It's a bold move, but you're still within your budget and have a good chance of reaching an agreement. If rejected, you can still make further adjustments.
* **Setting the pace:** This strong counteroffer demonstrates your serious intent to buy the product, while also putting pressure on Alice to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Negotiation continues:** You still have several rounds left to try and negotiate a lower price.
* **Avoiding unnecessary cost:** Accepting this offer would mean spending more than necessary.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and your previous one.
* **Demonstrating flexibility:** It shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Still within your budget:**  This price is still well below your maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**  Alice will either accept this offer, making a counteroffer, or reject it and potentially offer a new price in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price point.
* **Time is running out:** You have only 5 rounds remaining, and the risk of buying from John for a higher price is increasing.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though you're accepting the offer, you can still try to negotiate a lower price for potential future deals or shipping costs. 

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price in future rounds, the risk of getting a worse deal from John or running out of time outweighs the potential gains. Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price within your budget."
