"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this will motivate Bob to negotiate, while still offering him a good deal compared to his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I believe this shows flexibility while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I believe I can negotiate closer to my desired price, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin. I hope this will convince Bob to accept and close the deal."
