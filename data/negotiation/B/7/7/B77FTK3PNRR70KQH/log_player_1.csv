"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both our valuations ($1,800,000), we set a strong anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept this initial offer, it sets the stage for negotiation within a higher range.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the ""valuable product"" and its ""true worth,"" aiming to frame the negotiation around the product's merits rather than just the price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price allows us ample room to negotiate down over the remaining rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above our $1,000,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price.  How about $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $500,000 is far below both our valuation and his own perceived value of the product.  While we expected a lower counter, this significant a difference suggests room for negotiation. We'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,450,000? This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We're reducing our price substantially from $1,800,000 to $1,450,000 to show flexibility and movement towards Bob's range. However, we are still aiming high, well above both our minimum and Bob's stated value. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this is a ""significant reduction"" and a move to ""find a middle ground,"" reinforcing the collaborative nature of the negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:** We continue to subtly emphasize the product's value to justify the high price, aiming to shift Bob's anchor upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I still think there's a gap. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  That's a substantial jump on my end, showing I'm serious about purchasing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below both our minimum and what he claims the product is worth to him. This suggests he has more room to move. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're serious about a price that reflects the product's true value. We'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  I'm also invested in closing this deal. To show my good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to reach an agreement that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Downward Trend:** We are continuing a gradual downward trend in our counteroffers to show Bob we are negotiating seriously.  
* **Highlighting Concessions:**  We are emphasizing that this price ($1,200,000) is a ""significant concession"" and a sign of our ""desire to reach an agreement."" This emphasizes fairness and reciprocity.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We are still significantly above both our minimum and Bob's initial offer, reflecting the inherent value of the product. This keeps us in a strong negotiating position for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. Let's find that sweet spot.  I'm proposing $800,000.  This offer reflects a significant increase on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $800,000 is still below our $1,000,000 minimum. It's tempting to accept, but Bob's emphasis on his ""significant increase"" and ""commitment"" suggests he's willing to go higher. We'll reject and signal we're getting close, but need him to move closer to our range. The risk of losing the deal to John is calculated as we are getting into the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I can sense we're both motivated to get this deal done. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers the true value of the product while reflecting our progress in the negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are coming slightly above our minimum ($1,050,000) to signal a willingness to close the deal but leaving little room for further concessions. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** By stating this offer ""considers the true value of the product,"" we reinforce that our position is tied to the product's worth, not just arbitrary numbers. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  With fewer rounds left, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to move closer to our price point to finalize the deal."
