"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price.  How about $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,450,000? This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's value.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I still think there's a gap. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  That's a substantial jump on my end, showing I'm serious about purchasing.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  I'm also invested in closing this deal. To show my good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
