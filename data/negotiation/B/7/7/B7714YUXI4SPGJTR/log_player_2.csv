"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own needs. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is less than the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000), it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject another counteroffer and he'd have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price close to his target while also ensuring the deal goes through."
