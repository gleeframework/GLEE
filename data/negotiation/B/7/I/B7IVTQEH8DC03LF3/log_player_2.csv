"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since Alice's value for the product is $1,000,000, there is room for negotiation.  A counteroffer closer to $1,200,000 might be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further, while also setting a clear lower bound for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still within his budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than what he would pay to John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price is too great. It's better to secure the product at a fair price and move on."
