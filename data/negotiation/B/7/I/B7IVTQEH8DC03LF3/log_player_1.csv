Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $1,400,000 is well above your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's within Bob's range:** $1,400,000 is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), making it a potentially attractive deal for him. 

This offer allows for a potential negotiation process, giving you a chance to secure a better price than John's offer while still maintaining the possibility of selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob in hopes of achieving a better price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer provides a middle ground for further negotiation, leaving room for both Bob and me to find a compromise."
