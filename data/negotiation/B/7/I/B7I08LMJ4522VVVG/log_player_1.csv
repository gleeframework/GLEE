"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, aiming for a quick deal, but still ensuring I'm getting a decent profit.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a great deal for a product worth so much to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm sticking to my goal of getting a good profit, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway.  Hopefully, this will convince him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and a good profit for me. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further negotiation rounds."
