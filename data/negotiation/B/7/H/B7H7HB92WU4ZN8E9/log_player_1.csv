{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95, which is a good starting point for a negotiation. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. This offer also includes a friendly message that emphasizes the value of the product and the good deal I'm offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to pay more than my fallback price of $80. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my original asking price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a little from my initial offer. How about $90? It's still a great deal for a product that's worth $100 to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```
I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm still trying to maximize my profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a fair price. I've also included a friendly message to maintain a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target price. How about $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's higher than what I could get from John.  It's a good compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
