"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 16000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $12,000, so this is a significant jump. However, I'm confident that with strategic negotiation, I can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is below my minimum value of $15,000. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I still believe there's room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages him to meet me halfway. I'm still not willing to go below my minimum value, but I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, believing that we can find a price that works for both of us.  There's still room for a counteroffer, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering $13,500. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I think this is a fair compromise, as it's only $500 away from his last offer, but still above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to budge, and I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's not worth risking further negotiation with only a few rounds left.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price."
