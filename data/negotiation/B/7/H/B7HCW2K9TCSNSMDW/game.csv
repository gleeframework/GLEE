"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $170? It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider this price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $155, which is a bit above your offer but still below my original price. It's a fair price for this high-quality product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",155.0,Alice,5,
