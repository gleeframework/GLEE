"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while also reflecting the product's minimum value to me.  I'm hoping this will gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. There's still room for negotiation and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $17,000. This is still above my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.  I'm hoping this counteroffer shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and keep negotiating.  I'm hopeful that Bob will continue to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer. If he doesn't, I will sell the product to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
