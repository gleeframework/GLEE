"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his initial interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's less than half of my minimum acceptable price.  I need to see if I can get him to increase his offer.  I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's still a healthy profit margin for me.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, and he'll be willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is showing some movement, his offer is still far from my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's getting closer to Bob's perceived value.  I'm hoping this will be the right offer to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for such a low price.  I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $825,000. This is a small compromise on my part, but it's still a significant profit margin for me.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John as it's a better offer than Bob's latest proposal."
