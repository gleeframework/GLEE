Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it uses language like ""true worth"" and ""potential"" to imply additional value Bob might be getting.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer serves as a gauge of Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  If he outright rejects it, you can significantly lower the price in a counter-offer, knowing John provides a safety net. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob (is he prone to negotiation, how badly does he need the product?) and your risk tolerance, you might choose a different opening offer."
