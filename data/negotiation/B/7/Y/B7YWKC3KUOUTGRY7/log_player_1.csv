This offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential counteroffer from Bob, while still exceeding your minimum goal of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum goal, I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to $1,150,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still motivated to reach a higher agreement. There is still room for negotiation, and I am willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer to see if we can come to a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding. Let's meet halfway on this last offer. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and it's still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider one last counteroffer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, the negotiations have stalled.  Bob is unwilling to go higher than $1,080,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to counteroffer, the chances of him accepting are slim. It's more beneficial to sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring a guaranteed sale and meeting my minimum price requirement."
