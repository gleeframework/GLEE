"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000?  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to reach my desired price point.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your understanding. Let's meet halfway on this last offer. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and it's still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider one last counteroffer from me.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
