"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible and are willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget, but there's room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $100? I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
