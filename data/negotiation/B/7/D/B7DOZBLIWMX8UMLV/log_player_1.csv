Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is interested, and then we can go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial price of $100,  Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum of $80, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by being too stubborn."
