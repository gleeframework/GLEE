"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a workable solution, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a new counteroffer of $1,450,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
