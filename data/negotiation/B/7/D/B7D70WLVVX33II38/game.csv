"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm hoping to find a price that's more in line with my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $825000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $825000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'd like to propose $750000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $800000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $800000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $775000, which is a fair price considering our back-and-forth.  What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,6,
