"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the features and benefits you mentioned.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground!",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
