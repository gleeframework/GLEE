"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $97.50?  That's a fair compromise between our positions.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your latest one. I can offer you the product for $101.50. It's a good price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",101.5,Alice,5,
