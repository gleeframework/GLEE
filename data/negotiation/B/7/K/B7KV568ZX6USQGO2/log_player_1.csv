Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you, for $14,000. This is a fantastic deal on something I know you'll get great use out of."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $12,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, so aiming slightly below Bob's maximum valuation makes sense. Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for you to potentially negotiate higher while still ensuring a significant profit margin. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
