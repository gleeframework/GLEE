"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $800,000 to me, but I know it would be even more valuable to you, given your specific needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth to you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm interested in the product, but I want to make sure I'm getting the best deal. I'll reject Alice's offer since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and buying it from John for $1,000,000 would be a better deal than Alice's offer.
