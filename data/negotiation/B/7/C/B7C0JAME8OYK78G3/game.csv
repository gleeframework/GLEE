"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the best price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer $1,300,000. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
