"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly above that mark. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still out of my price range. I'm firm on $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're at a bit of an impasse. I'm willing to consider $1,400,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  To sweeten the deal, I'd be willing to include [Add a valuable bonus related to the product, e.g., free support for X months, exclusive content, etc.]. This offer reflects my strong desire to work with you, but I also need to be realistic about the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the added bonus, and it's definitely tempting. However, I'm still sticking to my price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price for the product and reflects our respective needs.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to sign the deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
