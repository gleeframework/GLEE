"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,800,000."",
 ""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation in a price range favorable to you. Even if the offer is rejected, it sets a high benchmark in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This signals willingness to negotiate but also conveys the product's high worth. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for a mutually agreeable outcome over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches your absolute minimum acceptable price. While you could accept and end the negotiation now, there's still room for negotiation. You have eight rounds remaining, and rejecting this offer allows you to gauge how flexible Bob might be.  It's too early to settle for your minimum, especially when John offers the same amount as a guaranteed fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly above that mark. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through."",
 ""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While a significant decrease from the initial offer,  $1,600,000 still leaves room for further negotiation while keeping the price well above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:** Highlighting your compromise emphasizes the product's value and shows you're negotiating in good faith.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're not meeting Bob halfway just yet.  This signals that you value the product highly and encourages him to make a more substantial counteroffer if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still out of my price range. I'm firm on $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000, which is concerning. However, it's still early to concede. Here's why rejecting and countering is the best approach:

* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting his offer again, you're signaling that you're willing to walk away unless he moves closer to your range. This can expose if he has any flexibility at all. 
* **Alternative Still Available:** Remember, John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000. You lose nothing by continuing to negotiate with Bob for a few more rounds. 
* **Time for a Different Tactic:**  In the next round, consider a smaller concession, or shifting the conversation to non-price terms (like payment plan, bonuses, etc.) to add value for Bob and justify a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're at a bit of an impasse. I'm willing to consider $1,400,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  To sweeten the deal, I'd be willing to include [Add a valuable bonus related to the product, e.g., free support for X months, exclusive content, etc.]. This offer reflects my strong desire to work with you, but I also need to be realistic about the product's worth."",
 ""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer makes it clear that $1,400,000 is the lowest you'll go. 
* **Significant but Not Drastic Concession:** The $200,000 decrease is substantial and shows a willingness to compromise, but it still keeps the price well above Bob's offer.
* **Adding Value:**  Instead of focusing solely on price, you're now offering a bonus that adds value to Bob *without* significantly impacting your bottom line. This could make your offer more enticing and justify the higher price.
* **Time Pressure:**  By stating your bottom line and mentioning realism, you subtly introduce time pressure. Bob has fewer rounds remaining to either accept your final offer or risk losing the deal altogether. 
 
This strategy aims to either secure a favorable price now or force Bob to reveal his true willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the added bonus, and it's definitely tempting. However, I'm still sticking to my price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price for the product and reflects our respective needs.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to sign the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from negotiations with Bob. Here's why:

* **Bob is Unbudging:**  Even with your significant price reductions and added value, Bob refuses to budge from his initial offer of $1,200,000. This strongly suggests he's unwilling to meet you anywhere near your desired range.
* **Limited Rounds Remain:**  You have only four rounds left.  Continuing with Bob risks a stalemate, forcing you to accept his offer at the last minute or lose the deal entirely. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  John provides a safety net. You're guaranteed to sell the product for $1,200,000, which is the same amount Bob is offering.  

**While it's disappointing not to secure a higher price from Bob, accepting John's offer is the most rational decision at this point. It guarantees you achieve your minimum acceptable price without further risk or time wasted.**"
