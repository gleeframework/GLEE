"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $10000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a lot of time and effort into this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13500 for it. Can we discuss the details further?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep the price at $12000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value of the product. Could we possibly reach an agreement at this price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $12000, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll sell the product to you for $12250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to accommodate my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $12000. This aligns closely with what we've discussed previously and remains within my financial constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been patient, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12250. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $12250, and I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and support, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",12250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and appreciate the additional perks you've mentioned. However, I must respectfully decline. My budget is fixed at $12000, and I believe that's the most I can realistically offer. I hope you understand and respect my decision.",12000.0,Bob,10,
