Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as it's less than the $150 he values the product at. It also gives me a profit of $20, which is more than my minimum desired profit of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum desired profit of $120.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, while rejecting it risks a longer negotiation that could ultimately result in a lower price or even no sale."
