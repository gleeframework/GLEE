"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 8250?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $8250 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $8000 - that's my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable selling at 8000. How about we meet at 8100? That's the lowest I can go, but it's still a great deal for you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
