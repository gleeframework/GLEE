"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't divulge specifics just yet, I can tell you that it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe reflects its potential - $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that the product will more than pay for itself. If you're interested, I'd be happy to share more details.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
