"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and increase his willingness to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price, so I can afford to be patient and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but instead counter-offering with a price that's still higher than my minimum acceptable price but more reasonable than my initial offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm framing my counter-offer as a compromise, suggesting that it's a fair middle ground between our respective positions.
* **Urgency and Closing:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency to the message by mentioning closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $14,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away completely, and I might not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Time is ticking:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid losing time with further negotiations.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $14,000 is the most logical choice in this situation. It's close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm taking a calculated risk that I won't get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds."
