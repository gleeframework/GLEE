"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. Let's close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $14,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward from there.",14000.0,Bob,4,
