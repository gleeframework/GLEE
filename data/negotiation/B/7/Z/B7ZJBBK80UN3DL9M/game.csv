"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
