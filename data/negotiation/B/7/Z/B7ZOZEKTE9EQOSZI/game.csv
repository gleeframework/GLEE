"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $137.50. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $131.25. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",131.25,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $140? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a great value for what you'll be getting.",140.0,Alice,5,
