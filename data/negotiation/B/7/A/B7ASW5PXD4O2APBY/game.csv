"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which is a fair price given my value and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
