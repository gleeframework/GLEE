"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  He can either counteroffer again or buy from John if he feels he's reached a stalemate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While there is some wiggle room for negotiation, Bob has already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected both.  It seems like Alice is not willing to come down further.  It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed lower price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
