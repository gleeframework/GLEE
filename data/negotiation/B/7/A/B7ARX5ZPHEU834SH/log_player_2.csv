"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent deal, Bob can likely do better. He has 10 rounds to negotiate, and he can always buy from John for $10,000 if he doesn't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $11000?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While $11,000 is closer to his target, he still has room to negotiate and should continue pushing for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so he can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $10900. It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $10,000.  It's worth pushing for a slightly better deal, especially with 5 rounds still remaining. He has a fallback option in John, so he's not pressured to accept a price that's significantly higher than his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  It's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10800.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but $10850 is the lowest I can go.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now in a tricky position.  He's only 3 rounds away from having to buy from John.  While Alice's offer is a bit higher than his target, it's close enough to make it worthwhile.  There's a good chance Alice will not budge further, and he risks ending up paying the same price from John. It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer seems like the best strategy at this point."
