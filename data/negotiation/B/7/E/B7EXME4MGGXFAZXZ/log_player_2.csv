"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000, which is a fair compromise between our estimated values. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget. He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer allows for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given our respective valuations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer gives him another opportunity to try and lower the price further, potentially closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This offer represents a significant investment for me and is closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1325000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, he has several rounds left and could potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, considering my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 again. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1315000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While $1,315,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price range.  With only a few rounds left, the potential for further price reduction is low. 

At this point, Bob can secure the product from John for a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is well within his budget. This decision ensures the purchase and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice."
