Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my own budget constraints.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
