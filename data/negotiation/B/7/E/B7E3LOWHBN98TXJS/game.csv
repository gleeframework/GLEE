"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my own budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product.
