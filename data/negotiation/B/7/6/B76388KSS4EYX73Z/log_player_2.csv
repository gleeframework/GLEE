"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $9,500 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal from John since you know he's willing to sell for $10,000. There's room for negotiation."
