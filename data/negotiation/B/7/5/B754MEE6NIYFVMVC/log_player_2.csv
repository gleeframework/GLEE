"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's minimum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  This would still be a great profit for you, and I'm serious about buying the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, though.  How about $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's also a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely."
