Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  While the product looks interesting,  $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $120.  I think this is a fair price that's good for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I'll meet you at $123. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $123 is still a bit more than you wanted to pay, but it's getting closer to your target.  You're only $3 over your ideal price, and you're getting close to the end of the rounds. Accepting her offer is the best option to save money and get the product before going to John."
