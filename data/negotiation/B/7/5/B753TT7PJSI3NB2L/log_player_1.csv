Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that John will pay that amount.  This sets a strong baseline and forces Bob to make the first concession if he wants to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within range of what John is willing to pay.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer,  but not going back to my original price.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for his deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better price by continuing to negotiate. It's likely that if I reject this offer, he'll counter with something closer to $900,000, which is still a decent profit for me.  I'm going to take the offer and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
