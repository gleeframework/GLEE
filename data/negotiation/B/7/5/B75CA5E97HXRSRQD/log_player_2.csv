"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.
* It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in further back-and-forth, potentially driving the price back up or wasting time.
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
