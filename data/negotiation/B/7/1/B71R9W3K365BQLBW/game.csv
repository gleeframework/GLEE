"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still a bit lower than where I'd like to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,150? That would be a fair compromise, and I think it still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can close this deal!",9150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $8,900? That would be a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Can you consider that?",8900.0,Bob,4,
