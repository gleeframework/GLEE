"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we meet at $1,200,000? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
