"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $19,000? It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll reap.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going above $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to the product's real worth.  How about we compromise at $17,000? That's me coming down significantly to try and make this work.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering the market.",13000.0,Bob,6,
