Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who values the product at $150.  This should give us a good chance to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum price of $80, and it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly better price.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
