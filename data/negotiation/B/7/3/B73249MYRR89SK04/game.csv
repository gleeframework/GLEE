"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
