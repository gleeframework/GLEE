"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $170, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to create room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I'm confident that I can potentially get a higher price with further negotiation. I'll continue engaging with Bob, as selling to John at this point would only yield a slightly better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $145 is still a bit low for me, but I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. Would you be willing to go as low as $142? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the potential of losing out on a deal altogether."
