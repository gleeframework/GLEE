"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but is still within a range that Bob might consider. It leaves room for negotiation without immediately triggering a counter-offer or a rejection. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $900,000 is a good offer, but it's a little low for me. How about $950,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $925,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is very close and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer is a smart move, ensuring a sale and a significant profit."
