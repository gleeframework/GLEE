"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and I can potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. $900,000 is a good offer, but it's a little low for me. How about $950,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but I can try to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a lower price with a counteroffer. There are still several rounds left, and I want to maximize my savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $925,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
