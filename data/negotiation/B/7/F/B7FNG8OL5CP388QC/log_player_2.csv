"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save money. Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to him, there's no incentive to immediately accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to establish a lower price range.  $10,000 is a substantial discount and likely to prompt Alice to counter.  This approach helps Bob quickly establish a negotiation range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even lower price. He's already shown a willingness to go lower than $13,000, which gives him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is aiming to meet Alice halfway.  He's shown he's willing to go above his initial offer, and $11,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's still a good saving for Bob, and it might be close enough to Alice's desired price to encourage her to accept."
