"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. I believe it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm confident it can be even more valuable in the right hands.  To start, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. Considering its potential and my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $900000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1200000.  It's a fair price that recognizes your needs while still allowing me to achieve my goals.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. This amount reflects both the value I see in the product and my financial constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1050000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm confident this product has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  How about $1100000?  It's a small step up but will bridge the gap between our expectations.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. After further reflection, I would like to propose a price of $1075000 for the product. This amount aims to find a balance between acknowledging the product's potential value and adhering to my budget constraints.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1075000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to give you one more chance to close the deal at $1100000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What's your final decision?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for pushing the boundaries. I've considered your final offer carefully, and I'm willing to go up to $1087500 for the product. This amount is a reasonable compromise considering the product's potential value and my financial limitations.",1087500.0,Bob,8,
