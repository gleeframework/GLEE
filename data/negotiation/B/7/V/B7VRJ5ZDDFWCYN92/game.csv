"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, unfortunately $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given the features you've described, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to consider the purchase seriously.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1500000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1250000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I'm willing to pay. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
