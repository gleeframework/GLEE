"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,150,000. Let's discuss!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to close a deal that benefits us both. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
