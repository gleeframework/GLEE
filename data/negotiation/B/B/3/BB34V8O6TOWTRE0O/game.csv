"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,500,000.  Let's start with a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,450,000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,525,000. This price still allows me to get a fair return on my investment, and it's within a reasonable range for you. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,525,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns with my maximum budget. If this works for you, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
