"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I'm confident will benefit your business significantly.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I know you'll get from it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's still a significant amount more than what John is offering. You have some bargaining power here. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to John's offer."
