Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum of $80, but it's also lower than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  This allows me to maximize my earnings while also potentially securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $100 is still significantly higher than what I could get from John.  This ensures a sale and a decent profit."
