"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $150.
* Alice's offer of $120 is too high.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much as possible, so a counteroffer of $100 is a good starting point. 
* This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* It leaves room for negotiation, giving Alice a chance to accept or counter with a price closer to your desired range."
