Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'm selling. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but still ensures I make a profit. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, which could lead to a smoother transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference and go with $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum of $80, and it seems like we're getting close to a deal.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
