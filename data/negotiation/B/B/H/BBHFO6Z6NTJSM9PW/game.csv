"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you in the middle at $110, which is the lowest I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100. I can do $115, which is the best I can do. I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you.",115.0,Alice,5,,
