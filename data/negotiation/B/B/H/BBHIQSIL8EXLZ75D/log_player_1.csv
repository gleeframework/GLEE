{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential negotiation. This also emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, but I'm still very interested in purchasing it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I am aiming for a higher price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a guaranteed sale, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
