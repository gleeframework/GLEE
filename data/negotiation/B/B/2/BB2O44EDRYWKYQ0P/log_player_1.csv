{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving a good margin for myself. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at this price, considering the value I'm offering. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer but represents a compromise from my initial offer. I'm also appealing to his sense of fairness by suggesting a meeting halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round, or I can always sell to John for $12,000."

```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,250. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still holding firm on my minimum value. I'm also emphasizing fairness and the fact that we are both working to reach a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and am proposing a final price of $10,750. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if we can come to a more agreeable price. If not, I'll always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $11,100. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,100. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, and I'm emphasizing that this is a good price for both of us. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting we finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I've decided to stick with my original proposal of $10,500. I hope this meets your needs and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting down to the wire, and Bob is sticking to his $10,500 offer. While it's getting close to my minimum value, I'm not comfortable selling for that price.  I've had multiple rounds of negotiation, and I feel like I've given enough concessions. It's better to sell to John for $12,000 and secure a better deal."
