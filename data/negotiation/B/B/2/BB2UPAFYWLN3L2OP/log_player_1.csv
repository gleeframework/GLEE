Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000. I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, even more so than my reserve price. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous.  Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($1,190,000) aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message hints at another buyer (""limited-time offer"") and implies the product's value to Bob (""even more so than my reserve price""). This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to accept before losing the opportunity.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable potentially losing $10,000 to expedite the sale and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
