Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. It acknowledges the product's value while still leaving room for a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning other interested parties, I subtly remind Bob that this opportunity won't last forever, encouraging a quicker decision."
