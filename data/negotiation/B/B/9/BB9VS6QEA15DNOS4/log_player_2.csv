"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still gives room for further negotiation before reaching my maximum budget or considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice barely budged on her price, and it seems like she might be anchoring to her knowledge of my maximum budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get her closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I'm still having a hard time meeting that price.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between the last round of offers.  It shows a willingness to compromise but also holds firm on not overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $12,000, but that's the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is stuck on $12,000, but it's clear she's willing to negotiate. I'll push a bit further since time is a factor, and John's offer is always on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $10,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counteroffer represents a final attempt to secure a price closer to my desired range. By framing it as a ""final offer"" and emphasizing a sense of urgency, I hope to encourage Alice to accept rather than risk the deal falling through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $11,500. That's as close to the original offer as I can get. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good compromise.  While I didn't get my ideal price, it's significantly less than John's offer and within a reasonable range of Alice's value. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome, and I risk pushing Alice away."
