"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start with an offer above your minimum selling price. This gives you room to negotiate and makes Bob feel like he's getting a concession if the price goes down.
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and give you an idea of his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we aim for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum price, I still have room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By decreasing the price, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** The counter-offer is still significantly above both Bob's valuation and my minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Aim for a Win-Win:** I'm aiming for a price that is fair to both of us â€“ profitable for me while still offering value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, how about we aim for $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $135 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum selling price, ensuring a profit, and it seems unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting now guarantees a good deal without risking losing the sale by pushing for more."
