{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (our guaranteed price from John), there's room for negotiation to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its value to him.
    * We earn a profit of $300,000, which is more than the guaranteed profit from John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and presenting the offer as time-sensitive, we aim to incentivize Bob to make a decision quickly."
