"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and persuasive to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $10,000, which is closer to my target price of $12,000.  While I would prefer to get even more, it's a good deal considering I have limited rounds left.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to rely on John, which would leave me with less profit."
