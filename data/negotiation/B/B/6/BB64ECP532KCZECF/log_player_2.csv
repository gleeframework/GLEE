# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to find a way to make this work for both of us.  If you're willing to come down to $10,750, I'll accept.

Round 9

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has made several counteroffers, but it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to his price range. With only one round left, it's not likely that they'll come to an agreement.  It's better for Bob to secure the product from John for $8,000 to avoid risking the entire deal."
