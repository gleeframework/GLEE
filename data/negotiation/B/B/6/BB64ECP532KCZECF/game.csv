"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll consider it.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10000.  I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap. Would you consider accepting $10500 as a final compromise?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to find a way to make this work for both of us.  If you're willing to come down to $10750, I'll accept.  This would allow me to stay within my budget and would be a fair price for the product.  What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,8,
