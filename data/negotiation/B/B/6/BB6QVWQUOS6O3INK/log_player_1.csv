"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is still higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $900,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $875,000. This would be a good compromise and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. Holding firm now could lead to a better outcome in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this final:  $887,500, and we have a deal. This reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your desire for a fair price."",
""product_price"": 887500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and our previous one. It shows a willingness to compromise but also establishes a firm bottom line that's still significantly better than John's offer."
