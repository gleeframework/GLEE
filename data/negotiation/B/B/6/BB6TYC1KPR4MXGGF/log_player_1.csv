{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential compromise. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which might encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $13,500?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 less than my counteroffer.  It's getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk him walking away or me having to sell to John for less.  I'm going to accept his offer."
