Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to maximize profit.  Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might still net a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a price that is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    * Still attractive compared to our guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" we create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept the offer more readily.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, by starting at a higher price, we leave ourselves room to negotiate down if necessary, potentially securing a better deal than selling to John directly."
