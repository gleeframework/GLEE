Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's potential valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm offering it at a price of $11,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000. By offering it slightly below that at $11,500, she maximizes her chances of securing a sale at a price significantly above her minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is already strong, there's a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he got a slightly better deal. 
* **John as a Backup:** It's important to remember Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John at $10,000. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one possible strategy. Alice could start with a higher offer closer to $12,000 if she wants to test Bob's willingness to pay top dollar.
* The tone of the message is crucial. By highlighting the product's value and making it clear this is a special opportunity, Alice increases the perceived worth."
