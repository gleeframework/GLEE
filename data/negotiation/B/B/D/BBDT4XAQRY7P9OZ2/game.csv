"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 simply isn't enough for me.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for us. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing hard on the price, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, and both of us can walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a bold move and propose a price of $9,000, but I'll throw in a bonus: I'll also buy an additional product from you for $1,000. This way, you'll get a total of $10,000 from me, and I'll get the product I need. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,8,
