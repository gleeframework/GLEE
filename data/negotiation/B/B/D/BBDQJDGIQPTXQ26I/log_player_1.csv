""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $120. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Splitting the Difference:** A price of $120 is a reasonable starting point. It's closer to Bob's valuation while still giving you a significant profit margin. 

**Strategy:**  This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal. By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
