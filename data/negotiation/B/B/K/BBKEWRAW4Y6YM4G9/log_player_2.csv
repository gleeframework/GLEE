Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $11500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above his maximum budget, and continuing to negotiate risks him losing the product to another buyer or running out of time.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his budget."
