"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's initial offer is higher than both your budget and John's price. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! I appreciate the pitch, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message aims to be polite and not insulting.  We acknowledge Alice's offer and express interest, but clearly state the price is too high.  Offering $80 gives the appearance of being serious but open to moving upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still more expensive than buying from John. We have a little wiggle room, so it's worth seeing if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Alice came down $15. By countering with $90, we're essentially splitting the difference between her offer ($105) and our previous offer ($80) while leaning slightly in our favor.
* **Maintaining a Target:** We haven't forgotten our goal of staying under $100.  By aiming for $90, we leave ourselves some room to negotiate upwards slightly if needed. 
* **Respectful Persistence:**  We continue to be appreciative of Alice's time and acknowledge her movement, but we stand firm on finding a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. How about $97? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is down to $97, which is only $3 away from John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further haggling for a tiny potential saving isn't worth the risk of Alice walking away from the deal. It's likely this is her final offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
