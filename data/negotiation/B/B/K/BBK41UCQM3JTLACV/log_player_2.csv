# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find it a great value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice to potentially get a lower price when a guaranteed deal is available from John."
