"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1400000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price still reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
