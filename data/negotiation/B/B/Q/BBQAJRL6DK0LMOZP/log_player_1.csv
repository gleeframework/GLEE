"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe there's potential for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I believe that $950,000 is a fair compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still securing a significant return."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $850,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I still have time and am confident I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering a price of $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still provides me with a good profit.  I hope this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Selling to Bob for $875,000 is a good deal considering John is only offering $800,000."
