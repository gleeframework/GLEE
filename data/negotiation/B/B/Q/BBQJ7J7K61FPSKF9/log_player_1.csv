"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident that if Bob is truly interested, he will at least consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has shown interest. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise,  showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hopeful that this price will be attractive to Bob and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge further. There are still several rounds left and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $12,500.  This is a small compromise, but it shows flexibility and might encourage Bob to make a final move.  We're getting close to the end of our negotiations, so it's important to keep the dialogue going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low for me, and I'm concerned that if I keep negotiating with him, I might end up with an even worse offer.  John's offer of $12,000 guarantees me my minimum profit, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that for a potential gain with Bob."
