"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but I think $1,000,000 is a little high. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $800,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we seem to be going back and forth here. $850,000 is my final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to finalize the deal, but I'm not ready to give in just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to move forward with the sale.",925000.0,Alice,7,
