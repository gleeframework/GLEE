"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is a good price, I think I can still get closer to my target of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,250? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,100. I'm confident that's a fair offer for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $12,000,  $11,100 is a good price and secures a deal.  I don't want to risk losing Bob and ending up selling to John for $10,000."
