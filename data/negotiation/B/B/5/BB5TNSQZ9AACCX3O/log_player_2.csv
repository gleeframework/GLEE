"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You have no idea what the product is worth to her, and there's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore the negotiation process and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This is a significant reduction from her initial price, and it might make her feel pressured to come down a bit. I'm hoping this will open a dialogue and help us find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a good price, it's still more than half of what John is asking.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, so I'm going to reject her offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest price, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable agreement. I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept and avoid having to go through more rounds of back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit high. Since I'm already in a negotiation with Alice and have a clear understanding of her willingness to negotiate, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal with another counteroffer. There's a chance that by showing my commitment to finding a reasonable price, I can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $350,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal.  It's a compromise that reflects the progress we've made in the negotiation. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Alice to accept my offer, but if she rejects it, I'll be prepared to make a final counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original price, showing that she's not willing to budge further. While $500,000 is a good price, it's still significantly higher than my desired price.  I've already tried negotiating, and it's clear that we're at an impasse. To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product, it's more efficient to buy it from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Alice."
