"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's more favorable for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, considering the value you place on it, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still allows us to come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
