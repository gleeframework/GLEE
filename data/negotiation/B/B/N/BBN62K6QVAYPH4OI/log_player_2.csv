"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. It's a steal! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to the $120 option.  You have 9 more rounds to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $80. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
