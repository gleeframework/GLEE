{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm offering it to you for $180. It's definitely worth more than that, but I'm willing to start with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you starting with a good deal.  However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. I'll try to counteroffer him and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150.  This product is really high quality and worth the investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand the product is high quality, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go to $120. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I could sell to John for the same amount, I'd rather close the deal with Bob and potentially have a future relationship with him."
