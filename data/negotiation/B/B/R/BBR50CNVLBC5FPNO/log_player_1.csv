"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm looking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price. I'm also keeping the message friendly to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I have 9 rounds left, and I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your position, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum, but also closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate. I'm also emphasizing the ""closing the deal"" aspect, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I still can't go above $12,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still stuck at $12,000. I'm not going to settle for that yet. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on price.  Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer.  If you're interested, let's close the deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm making one final concession, but I'm emphasizing that this is my absolute bottom line. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and encourages him to accept the offer. I'm also reminding him about my other options to highlight the potential for him to lose the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I really appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $12,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still not at my desired price. I have 4 rounds left and I think I can push for a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to come down to $12,800 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal before I have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

I'm making one last compromise, but it's still a bit higher than Bob's offer.  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, and the ""look elsewhere"" part is a gentle reminder of my options.  We're getting closer, and hopefully, this will be the deal."
