"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal selling price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. This keeps the negotiation going while indicating that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping for a better price. There are still a few rounds left, so I can afford to be slightly more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm meeting Bob halfway in this round.  While I still think the product is worth more, I'm recognizing the possibility that we may be nearing the end of the negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with the price, and I believe we can get closer to my desired value. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While I'm running out of rounds, I don't want to settle for a price that is significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, hoping to meet Bob in the middle.  This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping it will be enough to seal the deal.  With only 3 rounds left, time is running out, and I need to find a price that both of us are comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's time to accept Bob's offer.  $8,800 is a fair price considering the time constraint and the possibility of having to settle for John's offer.  This is a good outcome, as I'm able to secure a price above my minimum."
