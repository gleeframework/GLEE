"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure we can make a deal.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $130, which I think is fair for both of us. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $127.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",127.5,Bob,4,
