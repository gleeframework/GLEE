"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would still be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
