"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me and considering its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. This seems like a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
