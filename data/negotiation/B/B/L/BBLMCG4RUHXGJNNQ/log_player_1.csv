Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to our desired price, we have room to negotiate and aim for a higher profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position on the budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of this unique product while acknowledging our negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency. It signals I'm firm on the price while still offering him a chance to secure the product at a price above my fallback option (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet our $1,300,000 mark. Accepting at $1,225,000 secures a profit of $225,000, which is a significant return. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds, potentially leaving us with John's offer as the only option."
