Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price and John's offer. This means there's room to negotiate a price that earns you a substantial profit.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,250,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from your minimum, yet still offers Bob a considerable saving compared to his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows some space for Bob to counter-offer, should he desire to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his valuation of the product."
