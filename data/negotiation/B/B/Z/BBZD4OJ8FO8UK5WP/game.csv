"Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and would be highly valuable to your portfolio.  I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a strong price considering its potential.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your commitment to this deal is clear.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to drop to $1,150,000. I believe this price represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. I'm proposing $900,000 as a fair compromise. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. I am confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
