"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $1,450,000, which is a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,450,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to meet you halfway.  Let's try to work something out.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that gives us both some room for profit.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to get closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
