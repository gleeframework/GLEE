"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $1,450,000, which is a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's too early to buy from John yet as I might be able to get a better deal with Alice through negotiation. I will reject her offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,450,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer that's still within the realm of possibility for Alice. This gives me a starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for potential compromise in the following rounds.  It's also still below my maximum budget, giving me some wiggle room if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to meet you halfway.  Let's try to work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I want to keep negotiating to try and secure a better deal closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that gives us both some room for profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. $1,300,000 is still within my budget and provides a compromise point for Alice.  I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to get closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's getting closer to my target, I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round.  I'm also starting to consider buying from John, as it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1310000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice that I'm committed to reaching a deal but also that I'm not willing to overpay.  $1,310,000 is still below my maximum budget and is a compromise point for Alice. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close a deal, so I'm offering a price that I think is fair to both of us. However, I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
