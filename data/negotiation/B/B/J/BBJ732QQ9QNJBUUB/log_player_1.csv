Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,450,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that gives us both some room for profit.  What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:

``` 
This is a good deal for you, as $1,310,000 is closer to your desired price than what John is offering, and it's still a good profit margin for Bob.  It's likely that you won't be able to get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
