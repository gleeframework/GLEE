Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $155?  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell to John. While I'm still hoping for a higher price from Bob, I'm getting close to running out of rounds, and I'm not sure if I can get Bob to budge further. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is a safe and solid deal."
