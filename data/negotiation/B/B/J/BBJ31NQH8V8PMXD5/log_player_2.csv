"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  This is a starting point for discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,250,000 is quite a bit above my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has considerable potential, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,875,000 is still over your budget.  Rejecting this offer gives you more room to negotiate. You still have several rounds left, and there's a chance you can get closer to your target price.  Also,  you have the option to buy from John at any time for $1,500,000, so you have a safety net."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but $1,875,000 is still a bit high for me.

I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, I need to get at least $1,750,000 out of this product.  I'm willing to accept that as a final offer if it works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
