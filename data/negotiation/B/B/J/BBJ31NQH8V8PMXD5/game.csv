"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  This is a starting point for discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,250,000 is quite a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential it offers. I hope you'll consider my counteroffer.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has considerable potential, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000?",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but $1,875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, I need to get at least $1,750,000 out of this product.  I'm willing to accept that as a final offer if it works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I can offer $1,680,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for me. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1680000.0,Bob,6,
