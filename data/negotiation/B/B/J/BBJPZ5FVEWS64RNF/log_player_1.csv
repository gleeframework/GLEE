Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if you sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation increases the likelihood he'll accept while still securing you a significant gain.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know how valuable it would be for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing mutual benefit and Bob's unique opportunity.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 allows Bob to realize some of the product's value to him (a saving of $50,000) while granting you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you feel in Bob's eagerness to acquire the product."
