"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  given the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $800,000. Would you consider $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a significant concession on my end. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
