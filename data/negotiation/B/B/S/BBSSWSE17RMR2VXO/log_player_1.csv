Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the value of the product for Bob might make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By not immediately going for my minimum ($15,000), I leave space for counteroffers and a potential mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Backup plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net and prevents me from settling for a price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $13,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also below the value I place on the product ($15,000).
* **Potential for a better deal:** Although Bob's offer is a rejection, it opens the door for further negotiation.  I can potentially reach a price closer to my desired value by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is the safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's initial offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:** I'm offering a significant compromise from my initial $13,000 offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum desired value.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the worth in my offer.
* **Leaving space for negotiation:** I'm not completely shutting the door on further negotiation. This allows Bob to make a counteroffer if he still finds the price too high. 
* **Confidence from John's offer:** My decision to counteroffer rather than sell to John shows my confidence in reaching a more favorable agreement with Bob."
