"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $13,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $13,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget.  You're better off buying from John for $8,000 to stay within your price limit."
