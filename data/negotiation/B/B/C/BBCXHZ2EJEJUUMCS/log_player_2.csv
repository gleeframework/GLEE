Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,500?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. $9,750 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

We are getting close to John's price, and further haggling might not yield much better. Accepting at $10,250 is a reasonable compromise."
