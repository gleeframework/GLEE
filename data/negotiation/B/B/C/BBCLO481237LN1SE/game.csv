"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,200,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to the mark. To demonstrate my commitment to finding an agreement, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
