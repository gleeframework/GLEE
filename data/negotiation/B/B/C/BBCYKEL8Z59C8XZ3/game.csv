"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. That's my best offer for now.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,000. I'm still thinking $9,500 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $11,000. How about we settle on $10,750? This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I think I've compromised enough. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",10000.0,Bob,6,
