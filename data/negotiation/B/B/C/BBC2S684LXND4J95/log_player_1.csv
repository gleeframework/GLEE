Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you as well. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, while also subtly highlighting my own high valuation for the product. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob is willing to negotiate, he'll likely counter-offer.
* **Set a high initial benchmark:** Starting at $900,000 sets a higher expectation for potential future offers.
* **Keep the door open to John:**  I can always revert to John's $1,000,000 offer if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.** While it's tempting to take the $750,000, I believe I can still secure a better deal. 
* **I want to leverage John's offer as a safety net.**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me room to negotiate with Bob more aggressively.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial $900,000 offer, leaving some room for negotiation while still maintaining a higher target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price to $850,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect and highlights the value Bob would still receive. 
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Keep the negotiation moving:** I'm not giving up easily.
    * **Maintain a higher price point:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.
    * **Signal my willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob that I'm open to finding a middle ground. 

By taking this approach, I'm hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while also protecting my own interests and potentially securing a better deal than the $1,000,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal, especially considering John's offer.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that might lead to a more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my previous counteroffer. This will signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also determined to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $775,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs and keeps the deal moving forward.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $812,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's current offer of $775,000. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect and highlighting the positive outcome for both of us.  
* **Strategy:**
    * **Signal flexibility:** This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.
    * **Maintain a higher price point:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
    * **Increase pressure:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation momentum going.

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while still protecting my interests and potentially securing a better deal than the $1,000,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with the price at $812,500. I'd like to propose a final offer of $795,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer, but still below my desired price.** While $795,000 is a significant amount of money, it's not enough to make me abandon my goal of getting closer to my initial valuation.
* **John's offer provides a guaranteed higher return.**  The potential for further negotiation with Bob exists, but there's no guarantee of success. 
* **Time is a factor.**  The negotiation process is taking time, and I need to consider the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John guarantees a safe and profitable transaction."
