"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you as well. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $775,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs and keeps the deal moving forward.  Let's make this happen.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with the price at $812,500. I'd like to propose a final offer of $795,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can accept it.",795000.0,Bob,6,
