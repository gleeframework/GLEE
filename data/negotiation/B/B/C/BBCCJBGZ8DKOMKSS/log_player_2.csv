"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $875,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close this transaction quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise, and it's still within Bob's budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer again and potentially forcing Bob to buy from John for $800,000 outweighs the potential gains from continued negotiation. Accepting this offer saves Bob time and ensures a solid deal."
