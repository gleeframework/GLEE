"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $875,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close this transaction quickly.",875000.0,Alice,3,
