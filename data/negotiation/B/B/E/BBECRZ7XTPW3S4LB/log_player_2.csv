"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget ($1,500,000).** This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better price.**  Bob can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come up.

**Next steps:** Bob should make a counteroffer, starting with a price closer to his maximum budget but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product is interesting, $950,000 is a bit lower than I anticipated. Given its potential value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's maximum budget but leaves room for negotiation.** Bob is offering $1,300,000, which is $200,000 less than his maximum budget, leaving space for Alice to negotiate.
* **The message is polite and professional.** It acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing Bob's interest in the product, but with a higher price point. 
* **The counteroffer provides a clear price and a reason behind it.**  Bob states he believes the product is valuable, justifying the higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1300000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.** It's $300,000 lower than Bob's initial counteroffer and $300,000 higher than Alice's original offer.
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John.** This is a significant saving.

**Conclusion:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially ending up with a higher price from John makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice."
