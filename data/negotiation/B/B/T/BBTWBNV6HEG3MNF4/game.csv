"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and takes into account the value the product holds for you.
