"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* You have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price. 
* Buying from John at $8,000 is a guaranteed option, but you want to see if you can do better with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and takes into account the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer is $9,500, which is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to my desired price.
*  John is offering a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best deal for me. It's worth securing the product now and avoiding any further negotiation risk."
