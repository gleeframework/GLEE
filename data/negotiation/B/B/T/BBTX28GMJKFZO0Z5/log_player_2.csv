"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us and we could finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, but he also wants to acquire the product.  Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and higher than Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that's still within his budget and saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
