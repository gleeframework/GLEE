Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts high, reflecting the value I place on the product. It also gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However, I'm keeping the offer within a range that I believe is still attractive to Bob, while still exceeding the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still lower than I'd like, even though it's closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a middle ground. I'll make a counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a psychologically compelling price point, being a ""round"" number that's easy to understand and feels like a concession. I'm hoping to get a deal close to this price, but I'm also ready to walk away if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price. While it's still not ideal, it's getting more and more tempting to close the deal.  Furthermore, there's no guarantee that continuing the negotiation will lead to a better offer. It's time to lock in a good price, especially since it exceeds John's offer."
