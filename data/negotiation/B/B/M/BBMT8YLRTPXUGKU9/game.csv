"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. It's a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $1250000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
