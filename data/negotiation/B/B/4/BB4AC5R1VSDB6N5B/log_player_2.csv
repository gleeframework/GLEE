Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice is not budging much from her initial offers. It's unlikely she'll go below $9,000, and at this point, cutting my losses and buying from John at $8,000 is the most financially sensible choice."
