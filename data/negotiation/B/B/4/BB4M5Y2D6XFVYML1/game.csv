"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $12000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11000, which is still a good deal for you, and gets me closer to my target price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I can offer $10500, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $11500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
