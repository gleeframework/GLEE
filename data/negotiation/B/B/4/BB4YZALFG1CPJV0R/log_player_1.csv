Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but also allows me to potentially earn a good profit.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
