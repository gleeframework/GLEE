Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,500.  It's a great price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $12,500 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product and the ""good price"" emphasizes the benefits of accepting my offer.
* **Flexibility:**  Ending the message with ""Let me know what you think!"" encourages Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but there's still potential for a better price.  I can likely get closer to my desired $12,500 with a counteroffer.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to explore whether I can get a more favorable deal.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a safe option, but it would leave money on the table.  By continuing to negotiate with Bob, I can try to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 for the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm still asking for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.  This shows that I'm still confident in the product's value. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to accept, creating a sense of urgency without being pushy."
