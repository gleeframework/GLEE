I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $15,000, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product more highly and is willing to pay closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer of $10,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair compromise and is willing to meet me in the middle."

Bob is not willing to come up to a price I'm comfortable with. I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, and I don't want to continue this negotiation for such a low price. I'm better off selling the product to John for $15,000."
