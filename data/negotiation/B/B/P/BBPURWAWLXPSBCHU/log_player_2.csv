# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, the product's inherent value and potential far exceed your current offer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs and the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe it represents a fair compromise and reflects the true potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your budget. Even though she claims it's her final offer, there's no guarantee she won't change her mind again. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiations, and it seems unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your desired price.  It's best to cut your losses and buy from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000."
