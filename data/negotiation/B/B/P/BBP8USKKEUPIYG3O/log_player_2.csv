"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too early to buy from John, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $12,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still too high for Bob.  $12,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000, and it's not clear if Alice is willing to go much lower. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still out of my range.  I'm happy to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
