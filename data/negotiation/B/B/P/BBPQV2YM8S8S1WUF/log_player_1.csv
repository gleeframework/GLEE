Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to me and $80 to him. This allows for some profit for me while still potentially being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and is likely more appealing to Bob than his own offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $120.  Bob's latest offer is too low, and I'm not confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's better to guarantee myself the full value of the product by selling to John."
