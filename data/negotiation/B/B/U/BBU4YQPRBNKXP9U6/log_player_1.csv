Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that benefits us both. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high aims to secure the maximum possible profit from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility, making Bob feel more in control and potentially leading to a price higher than $800,000.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback if Bob refuses.  This allows Alice to confidently hold firm on a higher price."
