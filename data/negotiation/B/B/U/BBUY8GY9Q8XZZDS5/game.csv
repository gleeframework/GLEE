Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial constraints. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1200000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Given the product's uniqueness and my interest, I'm prepared to go up to $800000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of both the product's value and my ability to pay. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1000000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your interest. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
