"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident in its value and believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable price. This anchors the negotiation higher. While $2,000,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant investment,"" I aim to frame the product in a way that justifies the high initial price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The language emphasizes that this is a ""starting point,"" making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make an offer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to signal that I'm serious about a higher valuation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product goes beyond simple comparisons. Its unique features and potential for your specific needs justify a premium. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Address:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and his reasoning based on ""market value."" This shows I'm listening and taking his perspective into account.
* **Reiterate Value Proposition:** I reinforce the product's unique value, emphasizing its specific benefits to Bob's needs (""your specific needs justify a premium""). This helps move the conversation away from purely market-based comparisons.
* **Concession and Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $100,000, but I'm framing it as a strategic move towards a ""fair compromise"" rather than a desperate price cut. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's unique features and potential, Alice, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to come down further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my price range, but $1,700,000 is still below my acceptable threshold. While I risk pushing him away, I believe there's room for him to go higher. I'll use my counteroffer to communicate a firm but potentially acceptable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've carefully considered your perspective and want to make this work. My final offer is $1,825,000. This price reflects the true value of this product and my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your decision - I believe this offer represents a fair and final opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm signaling that this is my best and final offer. This adds weight to the negotiation and encourages Bob to take it seriously.
* **Strategic Split:** By offering $1,825,000, I'm splitting the difference between his last offer ($1,700,000) and my previous counter ($1,900,000). This can be a powerful psychological tactic, making it seem like a very fair compromise.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I haven't explicitly stated a deadline, mentioning that this is a ""final opportunity"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially prompting a quicker decision from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,750,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are now past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While I have the option to continue, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher.
* **Profitable Offer:** $1,750,000 is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and represents a good profit margin for me. Holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Bob's Alternative:**  Bob mentioning John and a lower price is likely a negotiating tactic, but it highlights the risk that he might walk away if I push too hard. 

It's better to secure a strong deal now than risk getting a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
