,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at 125. How about we meet in the middle at 135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I think 130 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet at 138? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal.",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, I really want to buy this product, but I think $128 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting frustrated, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at 128. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at 132? It's the closest I can get to your maximum price, and I'm willing to make a deal.",132.0,Alice,7,
