"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying over $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of this product.  While your initial offer is understandable, it doesn't reflect the true worth of what's being offered.  To move us closer, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000.  This takes into account the unique benefits you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.  Let's find a common ground that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  It's clear you recognize the value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the unique benefits you'll receive.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I recognize the value you place on this product, $1,600,000 remains too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This demonstrates my continued commitment to acquiring this product, and I believe this price represents a fair compromise given our respective positions.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
