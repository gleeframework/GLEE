"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree this product would be great, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000, my absolute max?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute max, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already come down quite a bit from my original offer, and I think $14,000 is still a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",13500.0,Alice,5,
