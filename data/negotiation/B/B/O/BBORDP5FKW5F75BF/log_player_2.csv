Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute max, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already come down quite a bit from my original offer, and I think $14,000 is still a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is very unlikely to come down to my $12,000 limit.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
