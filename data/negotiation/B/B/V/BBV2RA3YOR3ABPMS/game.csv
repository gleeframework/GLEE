"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from it and allows me to receive a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

To make this deal work, I'm offering a final compromise: $1,050,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
