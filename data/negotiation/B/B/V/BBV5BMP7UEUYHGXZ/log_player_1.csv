Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Starting too high might make him walk away without countering.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **High but Negotiable Price:** $1,400,000 gives you room to negotiate while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""open to hearing your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage in negotiation.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price within the ZOPA. 
* **Don't undervalue:** Remember, you have a strong alternative with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
