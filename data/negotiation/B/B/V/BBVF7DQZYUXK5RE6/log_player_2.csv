"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than her actual value of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving $400,000."
