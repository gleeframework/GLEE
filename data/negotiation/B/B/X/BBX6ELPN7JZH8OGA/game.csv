"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there at $12,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
