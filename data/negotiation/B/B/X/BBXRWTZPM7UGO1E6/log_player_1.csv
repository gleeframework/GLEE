"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation room and sets the initial bar high.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to accept quickly.  If not, we can work our way down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is far too low for me, as I value the product at no less than $12,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, hoping to signal my willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a price closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm confident that I can achieve this by continuing to counteroffer in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is another compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer. However, it still keeps me above my minimum price point.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize the deal. If not, we'll continue negotiating."
