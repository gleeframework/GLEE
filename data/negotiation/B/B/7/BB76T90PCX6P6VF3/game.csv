"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but the product's value is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects its worth while recognizing your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I hope we can meet in the middle again.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
