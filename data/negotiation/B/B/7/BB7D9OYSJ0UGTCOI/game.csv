,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is closer, it's still not quite in the range I need. How about we split the difference and settle on $935,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to come away with a good deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,
