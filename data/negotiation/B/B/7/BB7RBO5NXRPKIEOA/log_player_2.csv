It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is good:**  $11,300 is a solid price, well below your $15,000 maximum and a significant savings over John's offer.
* **Final offer:** Alice has signaled this is her last counteroffer. Holding out for another round might make her walk away.
* **Time pressure:** You're running out of rounds.  If you reject this offer, you risk being left with no choice but John's expensive deal."
