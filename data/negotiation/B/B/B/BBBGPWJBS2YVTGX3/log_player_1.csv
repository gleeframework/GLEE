"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my desired $1,200,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $975,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $962,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm not willing to settle for a price that low, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price.  It's time to try and push for a better deal or take the guaranteed offer from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $962,500 is still quite a bit below my desired price.

Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 987500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $983,750 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $983,750.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $983,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal.  I'm committed to getting as close to my $1,200,000 as possible. Since we have a few rounds left, I will continue to negotiate with Bob and see if we can bridge the gap. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $983,750 is still significantly below the true value of this product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $991,375 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $991,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $991,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below what I'm aiming for. While a deal with Bob at $991,375 would be a decent outcome, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with him and potentially getting a worse offer. 

With only two rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price of $1,200,000, it's the safest and most profitable option. 

I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on the full potential value of the product."
