"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $700,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm eager to finalize a deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $675,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and would be happy to finalize the deal at this price.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. While $675,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping to finalize a deal at a slightly lower price. I'm ready to offer $660,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win scenario.",660000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $670,000. I believe this price still represents a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",670000.0,Alice,5,
