Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, which I'd get from John, but it also leaves some room for negotiation and still provides Bob with a significant gain ($200,000) from buying the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  A million dollars is a great deal for me. 
* **Appeal to Bob's interest:**  He still gets a good deal, and there's potential for him to negotiate a lower price if he's inclined. 

Let me know if you'd like me to explain a different offer strategy!"
