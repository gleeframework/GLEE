"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable selling it for that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
