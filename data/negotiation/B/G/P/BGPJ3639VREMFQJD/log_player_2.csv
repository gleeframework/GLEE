"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. I think it's a great value for the price, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance he can get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $130.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive stance, aiming for a lower price point that is still within his budget.  He's keeping the negotiation moving forward by offering a specific counteroffer that's not too far off from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $135 is a good price for Bob.  He's already saved $5 from his initial budget of $150, and further negotiation could take time and lead to a stalemate.  It's a reasonable compromise to accept the offer and secure the product."
