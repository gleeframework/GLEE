"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your budget constraints, $1500000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1650000. I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while accommodating your needs.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
