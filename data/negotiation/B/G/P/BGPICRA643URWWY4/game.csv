"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still allows you to acquire the product at a very competitive price, and it's closer to the value I need.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
