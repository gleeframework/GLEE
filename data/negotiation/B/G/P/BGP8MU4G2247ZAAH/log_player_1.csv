Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While I believe this product offers immense value at $1,000,000, I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $975,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which I believe is a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $925,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
