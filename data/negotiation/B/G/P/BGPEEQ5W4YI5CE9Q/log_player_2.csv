Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $900,000 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference and go with $912,500.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?
