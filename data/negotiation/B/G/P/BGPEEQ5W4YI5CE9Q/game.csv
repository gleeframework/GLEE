"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle on $925,000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $900,000 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference and go with $912,500.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm afraid $912,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, as previously offered.",900000.0,Bob,6,
