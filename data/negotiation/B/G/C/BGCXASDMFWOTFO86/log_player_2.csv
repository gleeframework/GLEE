"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking for $115. While it's a good price, you can do better.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate further with her or buy from John as a backup."
