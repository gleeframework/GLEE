"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure an exceptional value while enjoying all the benefits this product has to offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for Alice to come down in price, as she values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of that, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $13,500 for the product. This is my best offer, considering the value it provides and the opportunity cost involved. I hope this meets your expectations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $13,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer, and Bob could end up paying John's higher price.  It's better to lock in this deal and save the money."
