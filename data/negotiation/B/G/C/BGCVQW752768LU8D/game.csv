"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves significant room for profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
