"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. It's worth trying to counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves significant room for profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still a bit high.  There's still room to negotiate further. I'll aim for a price closer to my ideal of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, but I'm still not quite there. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering buying from John.  I'll try to bridge the gap a little further."
