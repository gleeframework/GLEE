"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $900,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worth it for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
