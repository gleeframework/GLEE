Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to sell it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your limits:** Your minimum acceptable price is $80 (selling to John), and Bob's maximum is $120. 
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Starting with an offer closer to Bob's maximum value ($120) is a good strategy. However,  asking for the full $120 might scare him off. 
* **Find a balance:** $100 is a strong starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a significant profit for you. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or any time constraints."
