"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point, as it gives me some room to negotiate while still being above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum price. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and we are running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum price and will ensure I don't lose money."
