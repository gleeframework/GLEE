"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start with his maximum budget of $8,000 as the counteroffer. This sets a clear boundary and lets Alice know Bob is serious about finding a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $16,000 is still too high for Bob.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly to $9,000. This shows he's willing to compromise but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, $14,500 is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer to show his willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a good compromise point, and there is a decent chance Alice will accept it, especially considering she's already come down from $18,000 to $14,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his ideal range. There are only three rounds left, and Bob still has a chance to negotiate a better price.  He should continue the negotiation process and see if he can get Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer to show his willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.  $11,000 is a good middle ground and with only two rounds left, it increases the pressure on Alice to accept. If Alice rejects, there's a chance she might counteroffer, but Bob can still fall back to John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for Bob, and it's the last round of negotiation.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob is getting close to his budget limit. It's a better strategy to buy from John at his guaranteed $8,000 price to avoid further risk and ensure a deal within his budget."
