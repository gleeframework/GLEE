"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob.  It's well above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer and negotiating is the best course of action to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer at his maximum budget of $1,000,000. This sets the negotiation stage and shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  Alice has incentive to accept since this is still more than she values the product at ($1,500,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still too high. Bob has ten rounds and can continue to negotiate for a better price. He should reject the offer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a compromise. It's halfway between his initial offer of $1,000,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,500,000. This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate, but he's also sticking to a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Bob has several rounds remaining and can continue negotiating to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant step toward Alice's price but still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and is getting very close to his last counteroffer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and the possibility of needing to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gains from continuing to negotiate."
