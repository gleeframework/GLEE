"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too far below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference one more time? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would get this deal done. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
