Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone can encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob might make him more willing to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my absolute minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This offer is a starting point. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I will always consider John's offer of $15,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly less than my desired price, and even lower than the initial offer I made. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I know I can sell to John for $15,000, so I have the leverage to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

I'll now make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but still acknowledging the need to find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a counter-offer that's a significant step up from Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Compromise and Flexibility:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to persuade him that my offer is fair.
* **Keep John's Offer in Mind:**  This offer keeps me well above my minimum price and gives me room to negotiate further if needed while ensuring I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:** I believe that further negotiation could lead to a higher price, closer to my initial offer. 
* **John's Offer Remains Safe:**  I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, which provides me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too far below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference one more time? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would get this deal done. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer represents a final attempt to find a middle ground. I'm willing to split the difference one last time, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message clearly states my final price and reinforces the idea of fairness for both parties. 
* **Focus on Resolution:**  I emphasize that accepting this offer will ""get this deal done,"" creating a sense of urgency and motivation for Bob to agree. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  While this offer is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal if needed."
