"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider my counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. I hope we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
