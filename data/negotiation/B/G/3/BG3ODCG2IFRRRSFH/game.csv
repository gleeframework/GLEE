"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $8000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $9500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms. Would you be willing to throw in some extras, like a free accessory or a warranty extension, if I meet you at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm happy to sweeten the deal, Bob! I can throw in a free accessory and a warranty extension if you meet me at $9000. But I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I still think $9000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $8500, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'm ready to make a deal.",8500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $9000, and I've already offered you some great extras to sweeten the deal. I think you're getting a fantastic offer, and I'm not willing to budge any further. If you're not willing to meet me at $9000, I'm going to have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,9,
