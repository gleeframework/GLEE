"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product will bring to your business. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $750,000, so I'm offering $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
