"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it.  While I think this product is great, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and agree on $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be very happy with the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $127.50. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit.",127.5,Alice,5,
