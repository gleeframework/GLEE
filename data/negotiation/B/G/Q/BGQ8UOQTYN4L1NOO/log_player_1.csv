We're nearing the end of the rounds and Bob's offer keeps circling back to $1,220,000.  While a bit higher than John's offer, I'm not sure I can push Bob any higher. I don't want to risk losing the sale completely, and I also need to weigh the risk of getting a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  Given these factors, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to secure the sale."
