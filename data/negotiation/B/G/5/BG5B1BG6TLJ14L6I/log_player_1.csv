Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're truly interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm confident I can do better, especially considering the product's value to him. I'll continue to try and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to drop to $850,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it allows us both to come away feeling satisfied. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, as I mentioned before. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value to me. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob seems determined to stay at $850,000, and I'm not willing to go that low. John offers a guaranteed price that's closer to my minimum and allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
