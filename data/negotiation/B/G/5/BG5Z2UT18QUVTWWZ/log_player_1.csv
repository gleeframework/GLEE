Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8800?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $8,800 is still below my minimum, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9200 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9100?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
