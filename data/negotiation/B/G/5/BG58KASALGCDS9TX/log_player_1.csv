Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is below my minimum price of $1,200,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's maximum budget is $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than that, but lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. Let's try to meet in the middle.

{""message"": ""I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can manage. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to secure the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

However, I should note that Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer from him. I'll have to consider the risk of selling to John for $1,200,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than that, but still lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll try to get closer to my target price.
