"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my opening offer. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range for a product worth this much. I want to see if Bob is serious and gauge his interest before making further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price at this stage. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but represents a significant concession from my initial offer. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession and very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this encourages Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I'm not comfortable risking losing the deal completely. Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob resulting in an even lower price."
