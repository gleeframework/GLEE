I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob a good deal while still allowing me to maximize my profit. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000.  This strategy allows me to potentially gain more while mitigating my risk."
