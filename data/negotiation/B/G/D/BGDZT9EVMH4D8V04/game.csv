"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price, considering its true value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $725000. I can go up to $675000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $675000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I can offer it to you for $700000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",700000.0,Alice,5,
