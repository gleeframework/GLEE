{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $120 for the product to make it worthwhile (since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price).
* **Bob's value:** Bob only values the product at $80, so I need to be realistic with my pricing.
* **Finding the sweet spot:** $100 is a good compromise. It's a decent discount for Bob, allowing him to potentially make a good deal, while still giving me a profit.

This offer allows for a potential win-win scenario, with Bob potentially getting a good deal and me getting a good price."
