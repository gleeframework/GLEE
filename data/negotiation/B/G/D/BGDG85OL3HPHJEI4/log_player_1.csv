{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to counteroffer and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:**  I can still sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, providing me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is too far off to accept immediately. There's still room for counteroffers to reach a more agreeable price.
* **Plan B:**  John remains a solid backup option if negotiations with Bob completely fail.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and ensures you get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm highlighting that the new price is still fair for both parties, emphasizing both profit and value.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** The message is positive and invites Bob to consider accepting this offer. 
* **Plan B:**  John is still a viable option if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Close to John's offer:**  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not a good deal for me considering John is willing to pay $12,000.
* **More room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a better price. 
* **Plan B:**  John is a safe backup option if negotiations break down.

**I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him.**  I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price without jeopardizing the sale."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still a bit too far from my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is a fair price that gives you a great product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering $10,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer of $10,500, demonstrating a genuine desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing that $10,000 is a fair price for what he's getting. 
* **Closing the Deal:** The message is positive and encouraging, urging Bob to accept this final offer and close the deal.
* **Plan B:**  John is still an excellent backup option if Bob rejects this offer.

This counteroffer is designed to make a final push for a mutually agreeable price, while still maintaining a reasonable profit for myself."
