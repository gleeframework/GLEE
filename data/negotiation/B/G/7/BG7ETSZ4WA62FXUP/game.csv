"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident you'll see the value in making a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,100,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we split the difference and land at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,080,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think we can shake on it.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
