"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a little too high for me. How about $115? It's closer to my budget and I think it's a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
