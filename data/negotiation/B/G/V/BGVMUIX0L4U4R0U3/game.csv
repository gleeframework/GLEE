"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I can't go as low as $137.50, I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a great price for the product and allows us both to make a fair deal. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $155, but I'm still a bit stretched on that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $137.50, which would be $141.75. Would you be willing to consider that price?",141.75,Bob,4,
