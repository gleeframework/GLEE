{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  There's a potential profit range of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000). Aiming for a price around $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of that profit while still leaving Bob with a feeling of getting a good deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk Appetite:** This offer is slightly riskier.  If Bob is very price-sensitive, he might reject it. You'll need to weigh your confidence in his valuation.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower offer might be more beneficial in the long run."
