"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I've thought it over, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1100000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can do $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested parties, though...",1050000.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000. Can you consider a price of $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50000. So, the total price would be $1050000 for the product and the service. Is that something you'd be interested in?",1050000.0,Alice,7,,
