{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still within a reasonable range.  This allows for some room to negotiate, while also demonstrating that you are serious about getting a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000.  This product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum asking price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
