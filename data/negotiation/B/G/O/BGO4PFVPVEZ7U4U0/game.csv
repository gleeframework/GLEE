"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As we've discussed, the product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1400000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1350000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $1350000 for the product. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1325000. I believe this price strikes a balance between the product's value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to consider.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm proposing a price of $1340000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.
