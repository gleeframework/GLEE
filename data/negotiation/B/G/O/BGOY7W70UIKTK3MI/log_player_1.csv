Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a slightly lower price to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
