"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a generous offer, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  While a $100,000 discount is good, there's still room for potential savings."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a slightly lower price to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to your business. What do you think?

Alice has met us halfway, and a price of $1,075,000 is a good deal.  It's a significant savings from the original price, and any further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
