"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly above your maximum valuation. It's time to negotiate!"

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer. This gives room to maneuver upwards and still potentially secure a price well below Alice's initial offer.
* **Significant Difference:**  A $2,500 difference from Alice's offer highlights that you're serious about a lower price.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is crucial for a successful negotiation, even when aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try to meet in the middle, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** You're at your maximum budget. It's unlikely you can get the price lower than this without walking away from the deal.
* **Direct Approach:** By directly suggesting the price you're willing to pay, you're showing Alice that you're serious and this is likely your final offer. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** While firm, the tone remains collaborative. You're not rejecting her outright but offering a solution that could benefit both of you."
