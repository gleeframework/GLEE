"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $78.  That's a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $81? It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",81.0,Alice,5,
