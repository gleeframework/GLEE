"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000.  This sets a strong initial expectation and gives me room to negotiate. While I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I want to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product or if he's just testing the waters.  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It's also a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating that I'm taking his offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would love to get more, it's the best offer I've received so far, and accepting it guarantees me my minimum desired profit. There's a risk that I could get a better offer in the next round, but there's also a risk that Bob could walk away.  Accepting his offer ensures a successful sale and avoids further uncertainty."
