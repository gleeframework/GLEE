Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000).

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for you to benefit. Aim for a price that gives Bob a good deal but also rewards you significantly.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's polite, acknowledges Bob's perceived value, and positions the price as a considered decision.
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000 gives you a $150,000 profit margin (a 12.5% gain over your minimum). Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than his valuation, a strong incentive to accept.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower your asking price, but never below $1,250,000.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, offering a slightly more generous price could be beneficial.
