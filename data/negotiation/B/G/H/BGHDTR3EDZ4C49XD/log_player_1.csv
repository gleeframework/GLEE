Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially make a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. This price is significantly less than the product's value to John and gives Bob a substantial discount while still earning Alice a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and calling it a ""one-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
