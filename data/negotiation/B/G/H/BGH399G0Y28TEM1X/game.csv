"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $13,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
