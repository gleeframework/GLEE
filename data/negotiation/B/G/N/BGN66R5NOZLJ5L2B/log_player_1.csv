Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer and opens the door for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product to make the offer more appealing. 

This approach aims to secure a favorable price while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a deal that's beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a guaranteed option:**  I have a backup option in John who's willing to pay my minimum price. This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a more favorable price, without risking a loss by accepting his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find a fair price. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal considering the value you see in this product. Let's meet halfway and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:** I'm dropping my price significantly from $1,000,000 to $850,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a profitable price:** $850,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob sees in the product, framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone respectful and encouraging, hoping to maintain a constructive dialogue and reach a mutually agreeable price.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation open, while still maintaining a profitable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Further negotiation risks losing John:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lower my price even further and potentially lead to a situation where I'm forced to accept an offer below my minimum.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price.  It's not worth risking a lower offer from Bob.

By choosing to sell to John, I ensure that I secure the maximum profit and avoid the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
