"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find a fair price. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal considering the value you see in this product. Let's meet halfway and make this deal work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
