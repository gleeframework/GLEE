"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  That's the highest I can go right now.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $17,000?  That would make it worth letting go.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is my final offer.",15000.0,Bob,4,
