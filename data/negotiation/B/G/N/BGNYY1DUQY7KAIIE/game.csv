"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $825000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $675000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering $785000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still open to negotiations. What do you think?",785000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I still think $785000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $675000. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $650000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",650000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're in a bit of a stalemate here. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm now offering $760000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's at least close to the product's value. I'm now offering $725000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm still not convinced that $725000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $650000. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $600000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",600000.0,Bob,10,
