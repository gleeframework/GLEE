Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob is willing to pay a premium, and I want to see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects this, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000.  This is still a significant profit for me and shows a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and agrees to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is also willing to pay that price, I'll go ahead and sell to John.  There's no need to continue negotiations with Bob, especially since we've been going back and forth and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from him."
