"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to explore further options and try to get a lower price.  It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially when the product's value to me is lower than the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident I can negotiate further and get a better deal. I'll counter again, aiming for a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $1,080,000 is within my budget.  While I'd prefer to get it lower, the risk of further negotiation dragging on and potentially leading me to buy from John at $1,500,000 outweighs the potential savings. It's time to close the deal and secure the product."
