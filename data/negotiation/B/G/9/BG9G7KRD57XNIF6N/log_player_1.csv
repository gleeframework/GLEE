Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,275,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($275,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
