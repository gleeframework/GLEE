"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still very confident in the value this product can bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's worth to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $11,500 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. How about $10,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a great deal, considering the product's worth to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to make a move on this, but $11,200 is still a stretch for me. To be honest, I've got another offer on the table for a similar product. If you're willing to go down to $10,800, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider the other option.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $11,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
