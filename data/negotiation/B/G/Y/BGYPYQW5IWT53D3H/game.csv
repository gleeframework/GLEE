"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a reasonable price, and I get a quick sale. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and within my reach. Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,500 to make this work. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a good deal for you, as it's closer to your desired price, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
