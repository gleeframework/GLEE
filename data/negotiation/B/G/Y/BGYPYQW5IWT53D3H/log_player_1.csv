Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a reasonable price, and I get a quick sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and within my reach. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to me, and while I want to close the deal, I can do better than Bob's offer. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,500 to make this work. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a good deal for you, as it's closer to your desired price, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is reasonable and we're nearing a deal. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and brings us closer to my minimum goal."
