"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a reasonable price, and I get a quick sale. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and within my reach. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,500 to make this work. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a good deal for you, as it's closer to your desired price, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
