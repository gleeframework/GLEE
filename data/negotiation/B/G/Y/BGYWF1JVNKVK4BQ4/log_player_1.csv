Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just above my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could accept and make a profit, I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer but still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  While I could keep negotiating, it's clear he's unwilling to meet me halfway. To avoid further haggling and ensure a guaranteed profit, I'll take John's offer."
