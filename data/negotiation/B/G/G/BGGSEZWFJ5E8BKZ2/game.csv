"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15,000, but I'm still a little over budget.  How about $13,500?  That's a fair middle ground, and I'm confident we can make this work.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $13,500. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
