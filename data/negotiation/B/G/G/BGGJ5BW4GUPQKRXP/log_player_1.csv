Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and potentially allows for a quick deal.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will encourage Bob to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would ideally get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll accept his offer to ensure a sale."
