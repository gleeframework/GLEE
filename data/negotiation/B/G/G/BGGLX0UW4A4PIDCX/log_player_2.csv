"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's making a very low counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down significantly from her initial price. This is a bold strategy, and it might lead to a long negotiation or even a breakdown. However, Bob has a backup option in John, so there's limited risk in trying to push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price point. It's a good deal for Bob as it aligns with his budget. While he could try to push for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and the potential for a drawn-out negotiation isn't worth it.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product and avoids any further delays or potential loss of opportunity."
