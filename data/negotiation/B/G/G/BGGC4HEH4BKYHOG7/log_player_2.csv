"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for a lower price from John."
