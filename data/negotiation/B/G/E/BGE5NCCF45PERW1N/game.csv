"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,500 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to get a good deal while still being a decent price for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
