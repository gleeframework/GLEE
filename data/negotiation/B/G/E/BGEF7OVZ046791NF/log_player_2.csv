"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and $9,500 is too high.  By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. You are offering significantly less than Alice's initial price, but still a bit above your absolute maximum. This allows for some negotiation room without immediately shutting down the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer again. $9,000 is still too high for you, and you have more room to negotiate.  Since you only have 10 rounds, you should not be afraid to take a little more time to negotiate and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

This counteroffer is still within your budget but closer to your desired price.  You are showing Alice that you are serious about getting the product, but that you are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer again. While it is getting closer to your desired price, you can likely get it for even less.  You have 5 rounds left, so you still have plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8100}
``` 

You are showing Alice that you are committed to getting a good deal.  This counteroffer is a small step closer to your ideal price, and will likely lead to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,600 is getting very close to your limit, you should reject the offer. You have only 3 rounds left and it's still possible to get the product for $8,000. By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially save an additional $600."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8050}
```

You're getting closer to your maximum price, but still leaving some room for Alice to come down. This counteroffer shows your commitment to getting a deal while leaving some room for further negotiation if needed. Remember, you only have two rounds left!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You only have one round left, and it's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $8,400.  By accepting the offer, you can secure the product for a price that's only slightly higher than your maximum budget."
