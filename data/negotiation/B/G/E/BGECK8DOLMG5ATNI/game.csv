"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its actual worth. How about $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $850000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925000. This still allows you to gain significant value from the product, while also ensuring I receive a fair price.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I value your perspective, $875000 still feels a bit low considering the potential value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? It's a good compromise that allows you to acquire this valuable product at a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm always open to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $887500 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle again at $900000. I'm confident that this price will allow you to maximize the value of the product while still providing me with a fair return.",900000.0,Alice,7,
