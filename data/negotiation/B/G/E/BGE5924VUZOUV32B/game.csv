"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to come down a bit. Would you be willing to do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still too far off from what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but $10,250 is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
