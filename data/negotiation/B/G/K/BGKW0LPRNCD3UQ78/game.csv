,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1400000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $1500000 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to drop my price to $1550000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1550000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1525000.  This is a fair price, and it would allow us to both close this deal.  What do you say?",1525000.0,Bob,6,
