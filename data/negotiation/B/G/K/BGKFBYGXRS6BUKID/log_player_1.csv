Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it's worth $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than what he thinks it's worth. This gives me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $120.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is a little too low for me.  How about $115? It's a great deal for a product you'll love!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm offering $115 as a counteroffer. This is still above my minimum value of $120, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'm hoping Bob will find this price acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  Selling to John for $120 is the best option for me at this point, as it guarantees I get my minimum value."
