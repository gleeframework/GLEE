"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is a little too low for me.  How about $115? It's a great deal for a product you'll love!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
