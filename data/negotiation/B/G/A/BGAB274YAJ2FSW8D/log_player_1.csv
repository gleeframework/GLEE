Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high with $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while also maximizing my potential profit.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more.  I want to see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's still a good price for me, and might be enough to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $14,200. This is a good price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or getting stuck with a lower price later on."
