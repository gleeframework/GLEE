"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is way above your budget of $12,000. It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $10,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and sets the stage for negotiation.  While it's likely too low for Alice to accept right away, it signals my serious interest in buying the product while also emphasizing my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it shows she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a lower price. I'm hoping to get closer to my target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $13,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it also reinforces my budget constraint. I believe this is a reasonable offer that might tempt Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $3,500 higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I believe there's still room for a better deal, and I'm not yet ready to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again increasing my offer, this time to $14,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer while staying within my comfort zone.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to accept, as we're now only $1,500 apart."
