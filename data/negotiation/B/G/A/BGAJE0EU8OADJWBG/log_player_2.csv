"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1250000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  However, if you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $1200000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,250,000.  Since this is above your maximum budget, it's better to reject her offer. You can then buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within your budget."
