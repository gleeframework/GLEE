"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $15000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for closer to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell the product to you for $17500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value considering the product's unique features. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $17500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here. I'm willing to go up to $16500, and I hope this is a price we can both agree on. ",16500.0,Bob,6,
