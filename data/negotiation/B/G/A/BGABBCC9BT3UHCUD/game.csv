"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I believe $1,120,000 is a more accurate reflection of that. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,120,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,080,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
