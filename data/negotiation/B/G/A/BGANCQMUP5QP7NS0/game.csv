"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $88.50? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's a fair compromise.",88.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $86.50 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no lower.",86.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $86.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $87.00, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to consider selling to John.",87.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still not willing to go above $86.50. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product, and I'd like to finalize the deal at that price.",86.5,Bob,8,
