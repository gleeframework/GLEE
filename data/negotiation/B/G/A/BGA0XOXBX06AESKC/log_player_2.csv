"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product for $15,000, accepting the offer is the best option.  Bob gets the product for his maximum budget, and there's no benefit to going with John who offers the same price."
