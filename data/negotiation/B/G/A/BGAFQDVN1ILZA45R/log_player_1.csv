Bob's offer of $915,000 is close to my desired price and a good compromise. Accepting this deal allows me to secure a substantial profit while also ending the negotiation.  There's a chance I could potentially get a slightly higher offer in the next round, but the risk of Bob walking away is too high.  It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing the sale entirely."
