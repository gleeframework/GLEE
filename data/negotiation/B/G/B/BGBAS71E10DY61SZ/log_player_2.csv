You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum value of $8,000. A counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still aim for a lower price. Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price from $9,500 to $10,000. There's potential for further negotiation to get closer to Bob's desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. $9,000 is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $10,000 and Bob's previous offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially get the deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob is still within his budget and can potentially get a lower price. Alice's price has gone up, indicating she is firming her stance.  However, there is still room for negotiation, as the deal is not finalized.  Bob can still try to get a lower price and avoid buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground again. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer of $10,500, but still lower.  The goal is to reach a compromise and avoid having to resort to John's offer.  Bob has shown flexibility, and Alice may be more receptive to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to John's price, Bob is still within his budget and wants to see if he can negotiate a lower price. There are only a few rounds left, so the pressure is mounting, but Bob is determined to save as much as possible. There's still a chance to get Alice to lower her price, and it's worth taking the risk to see if it's possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to make a counteroffer before he has to make a decision on either accepting Alice's price or buying from John.  This offer is a significant concession from Bob's last offer of $9,500, showing his willingness to compromise. 

It is a calculated risk, but Bob is hoping that Alice, having rejected his previous offer, will recognize the urgency of the situation and accept this price to avoid losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final round. Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price range, and there's no time left to negotiate further. Buying from John at $12,000 is the best option. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget while also avoiding the risk of potentially losing the deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
