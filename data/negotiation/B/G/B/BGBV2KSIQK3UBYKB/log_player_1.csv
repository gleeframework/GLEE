Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John at $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $149 seems more appealing and ""affordable"" than a flat $150. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, it's unlikely he'll pay close to $150 knowing it's worth significantly less to him. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a sale."
