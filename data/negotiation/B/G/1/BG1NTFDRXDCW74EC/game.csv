"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my max.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the product's value. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference and go with $155.  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
