{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to sell. Bob's initial offer was low, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to $15,000."
