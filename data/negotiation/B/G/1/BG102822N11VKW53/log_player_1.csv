Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,250 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we settle on $8,400?  This is a fair compromise that will allow us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $8,400 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  It's better to sell to John for $10,000 and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
