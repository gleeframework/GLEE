"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we settle on $8,400?  This is a fair compromise that will allow us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $8,400 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8200.0,Bob,6,
