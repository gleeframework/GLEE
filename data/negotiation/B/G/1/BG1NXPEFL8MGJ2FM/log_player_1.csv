Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's also not so high that it immediately makes Bob walk away. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not convinced it's worth it. I'd rather see if I can push for a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counteroffering at $155. This is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm hoping Bob will agree to it to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $152 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's only $2 less than what I could get from John, and I don't want to risk further negotiation, especially since he's already shown a willingness to move closer to my desired price.  I'll accept his offer."
