Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $10000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low for me. I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  I'm happy with the price John is offering, so I'm going to go ahead and sell to him."
