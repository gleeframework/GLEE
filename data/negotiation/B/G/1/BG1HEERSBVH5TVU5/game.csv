"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1200000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
