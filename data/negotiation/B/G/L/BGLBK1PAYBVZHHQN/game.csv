"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to achieve a fair return, while offering you a competitive opportunity.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the value I'll get from it. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply not enough for me to accept.  I'm committed to reaching a deal, but my minimum price for this product is $1500000.  This is a fair price, considering its value and potential for your business.  I'm open to further discussion, but I can't go lower than this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
