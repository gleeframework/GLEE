"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $15000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $15,000. This is a significant markup. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds and the ability to counteroffer.  There's a chance you can get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can always switch to John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $13000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope it aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  You have 7 rounds left, and there's room for further compromise. 
* **John's offer is still a viable option:**  If the negotiations with Alice fail, you can still purchase from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  This would allow us both to reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with a price of $12750 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still ensuring a reasonable return for the value provided by the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close, but still too high:**  While $12,750 is only $750 above your maximum, it's still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You're running out of time:** You have only 5 rounds left, and the negotiation is getting more tedious.
* **John's offer is now the best option:**  You're guaranteed to get the product for $12,000 from John, which is a better deal than any offer Alice has made so far. 

It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice, especially with limited time."
