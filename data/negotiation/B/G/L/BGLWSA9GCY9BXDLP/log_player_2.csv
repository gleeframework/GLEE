"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth more than what you're willing to pay, while still allowing us to achieve a fair profit. Please let me know if this proposal suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counter-offer Alice and try to get a better price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain a certain level of profitability for my business. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly. How about $11,000 for the product? This would still provide a reasonable profit for us while remaining within your budget. Let me know if this revised offer works for you.
