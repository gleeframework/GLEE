"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare gem that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I think it's a great product, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value and the extras I'm including.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
