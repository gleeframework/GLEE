"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You have a clear upper limit of $120 and Alice's willingness to sell for $80 suggests there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
