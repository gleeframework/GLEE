Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **Shows good faith:** It demonstrates you're willing to work with him. 

If Bob rejects, you can assess his counteroffer and decide if you want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than what John is offering ($80) and still meets my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
