Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000.  This is a compromise, but still a good profit margin for me. I think it's a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
