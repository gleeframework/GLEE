"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
