Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target of $1,400,000."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still not at the price I want. I'm going to try to push for a bit more before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge much further.  While I'd like to get a bit closer to my ideal price, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob at all is too high.  John is a guaranteed sale for a price that's very close to my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
