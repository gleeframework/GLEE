"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum threshold and a good middle ground.  I'm going to accept his offer."
