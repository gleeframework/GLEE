I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and potentially see if he's willing to pay a higher price.  If he rejects, I can then lower my price in subsequent counteroffers.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will be more attractive to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than what John is offering. I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
