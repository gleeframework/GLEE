"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
