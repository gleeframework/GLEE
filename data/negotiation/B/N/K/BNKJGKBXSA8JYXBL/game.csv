"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $8,200? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer. However, $8,200 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $7,600?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,600 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $7,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
