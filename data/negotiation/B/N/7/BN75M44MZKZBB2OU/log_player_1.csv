Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I need to ensure a fair deal. Would you consider $1,300,000? This feels like a good middle ground."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, Bob landing at $1,200,000 means we've reached my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee further negotiation will get me more, and it risks losing the sale entirely.  Accepting ensures I get the guaranteed amount."
