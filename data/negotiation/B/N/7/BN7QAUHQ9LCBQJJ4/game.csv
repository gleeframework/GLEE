"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
