"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This gives you a great price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway and give me a better price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can we try $9,750? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $9,750 is tempting, I need to be a little closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,000? This way, we both come closer to our ideal prices, and we can finally get this deal done. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can we try $9,800? It's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this point.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be honest, $9,800 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession.  How about we settle on $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,9,
