"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to start the negotiation with a strong initial offer while remaining open to compromise. I'm leaving a bit of room for Bob to counter, but the offer is high enough that it might entice him to accept quickly.  This saves time and prevents the risk of needing to make further concessions.  I'll also be watching closely to see how Bob responds - if he seems particularly hesitant, I'll be ready to move on to John in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth at least $12,000 to me.
* **Potential gain:** I could potentially get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob will walk away, but I'm willing to take that risk since his offer is so far below my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hopefully finding a middle ground with Bob. I'll be ready to move on to John if Bob doesn't come up to a reasonable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This gives you a great price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution.  It acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal and reiterates my need for a reasonable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic compromise. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own needs. By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway and give me a better price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to compromise my financial needs just yet. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth at least $12,000 to me.  
* **Potential gain:** I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round. 
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob will walk away, but I'm confident in my negotiating position and willing to take that chance.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, while still being open to finding a compromise. If Bob continues to be unwilling to come up to a reasonable price, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
