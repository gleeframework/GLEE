"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000.  This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000 as possible. I also want to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I want to see if I can get closer to $1,500,000 by counter-offering.  I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm offering $1,550,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, while still holding out for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to take another risk and try to negotiate a better deal. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I want to see if this is enough to get Bob to accept.  If he rejects, we'll be getting close to the point where it makes more sense to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I'm starting to run out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the safer option at this point."
