"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Potential:** This high starting point establishes a strong starting position and allows for potential concessions later. 
* **Knowing My Value:** I understand the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so this initial offer provides a buffer. 
* **Strategic Opening:** By starting high, I create a sense of urgency for Bob and encourage him to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe there is room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to explore that.
* **Risk-Reward:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I see potential for a higher price with Bob.
* **Time Management:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to see if a more acceptable deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** This offer is a compromise, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Balancing Values:**  $1,250,000 is a midpoint between my minimum value and Bob's offer, creating a potential point of agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Despite reducing my price, I still have a significant margin for further negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With multiple rounds left, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Value:** I'm hopeful that with continued negotiation, I can achieve a price closer to my desired target.
* **Time on My Side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample time to continue the negotiation process.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but the potential for a higher price with Bob is still worth exploring."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further reducing my price to $1,100,000. This offer is still above Bob's offer of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer to his perceived value.  This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining a profitable margin.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  By offering $1,100,000, I'm demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With 5 rounds remaining, I need to start finding a solution that both Bob and I can agree on.
* **Maintaining Margin:**  Even at $1,100,000, I would still be earning a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite some progress, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to prioritize securing a sale that meets my financial needs. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't risk losing out on a better opportunity.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** With limited rounds remaining, I need to make a decision that guarantees a successful outcome.
* **Profitability:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 provides a significant profit and secures my financial goals.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate or a lower price, potentially costing me a significant amount of money."
