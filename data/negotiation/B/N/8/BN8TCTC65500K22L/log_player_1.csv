Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, I can potentially get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider $9,200 for the product. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $9,200 is close to my target, I'm going to try to push for a bit more. I'm not quite ready to settle for that price, and I still have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,200. I'm still a bit off from my ideal price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,400? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this transaction. "", ""product_price"": 9400}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I'm willing to go up to $9,300 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,300.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal and avoids the risk of going another round with Bob, which could lead to him backing out entirely.  Also, with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
