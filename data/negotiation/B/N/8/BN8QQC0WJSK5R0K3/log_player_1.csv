Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable paying $1,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous negotiations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or move on to John. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work.  I'm willing to offer the product for $940,000.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your asking price, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable going above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $915,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where negotiations with Bob are going nowhere.  While $915,000 is not terrible, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on to John and secure the $1,200,000."
