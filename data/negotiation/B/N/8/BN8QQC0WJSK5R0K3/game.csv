"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable paying $1,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
