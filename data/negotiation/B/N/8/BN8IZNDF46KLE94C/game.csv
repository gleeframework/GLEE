"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I'll consider your offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm feeling your budget constraints, but $1,325,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $1,340,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
