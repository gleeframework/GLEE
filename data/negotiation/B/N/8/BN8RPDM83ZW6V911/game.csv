"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $15,250? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
