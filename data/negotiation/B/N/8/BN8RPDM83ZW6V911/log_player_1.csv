{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's worth, which may influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'll try to counter and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $15,250? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  It's worth it to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
