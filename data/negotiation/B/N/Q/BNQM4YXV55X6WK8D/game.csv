"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be persuaded to part with it for $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  To be frank, I'm considering another option at a lower price point. If you're open to something closer to $1,200,000, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I may have to pursue that other option.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
