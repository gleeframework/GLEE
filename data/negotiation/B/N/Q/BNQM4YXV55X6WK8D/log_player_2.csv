"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to negotiate down, getting closer to your $1,000,000 limit, or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget.  Would you consider $800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $800,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It establishes your budget constraint and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting low, you signal that you're serious about buying but need Alice to come down significantly. This gives you space to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be persuaded to part with it for $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down from her initial offer, $2,000,000 is still double your maximum budget and significantly higher than your fallback option of buying from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate, even if just a little, suggests there might be room to meet closer to a price you'd both find acceptable.
* **John as Leverage:** The fact that you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you bargaining power. Alice knows if she doesn't budge enough, she risks losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  To be frank, I'm considering another option at a lower price point. If you're open to something closer to $1,200,000, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I may have to pursue that other option."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness with Flexibility:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about your budget constraints while still signaling willingness to negotiate. 
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning the ""other option"" (John) without explicitly revealing the price creates pressure on Alice. She might be more willing to compromise if she believes she might lose the sale.
* **Strategic Counter:**  A $1,200,000 counteroffer aims for the middle ground between your previous offer ($800,000) and her current price ($2,000,000). This approach can sometimes lead to a faster resolution."
