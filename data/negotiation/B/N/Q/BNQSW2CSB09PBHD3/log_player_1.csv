{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm willing to go down a little bit, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm starting to run out of rounds. I'm worried that if I continue negotiating with Bob, I might not be able to get a price that's worth it. To guarantee a sale and a decent profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
