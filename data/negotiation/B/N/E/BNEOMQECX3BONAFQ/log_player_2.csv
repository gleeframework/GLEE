"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $90. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a better deal than John's price, it still leaves you paying more than the product is worth to you.  Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and buying from John is the best strategy in this scenario."
