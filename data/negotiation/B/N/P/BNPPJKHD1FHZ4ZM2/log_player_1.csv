Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible, but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer, to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the first offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this is a fair counter-offer that gives Bob some room to negotiate while still keeping me close to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired value, and I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with another offer, but I'll need to consider the risk of losing the deal to John if I don't come to an agreement with Bob soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, acknowledging the risk of losing the deal to John if I don't close with Bob. However, I still believe I can get a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer hasn't increased, and it's clear he is unlikely to meet my minimum value.  To avoid risking further negotiations that might not be fruitful, I'm choosing to sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
