,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $15000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I've been clear about my budget, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16500, which is $14500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14500.0,Bob,8,
