"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $120 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you value the product, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to do $90? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet at $105? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $95? That's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which would be $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",100.0,Alice,7,
