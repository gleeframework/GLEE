"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm counteroffering at $812,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to meet you near the middle.",812500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, this is a unique product and I'm willing to be decisive to get it. My final offer is $800,000.  This is a strong offer considering I could go with another vendor.",800000.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I appreciate your decisiveness, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,,
