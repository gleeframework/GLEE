Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing we have John as a backup.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The price has to be appealing to Bob (below $150) but above his perceived value ($80).
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 

By offering the product at $140, we test Bob's willingness to pay while still ensuring a profit above our minimum."
