"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting strong with this offer.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high. How about $11,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this round.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this round.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $12,800 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,200.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us and it's within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this round.",12200.0,Bob,6,
