Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It sets a reasonable expectation:**  It suggests you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product highly.

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below the price you initially proposed. This indicates he's willing to negotiate further.  By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a higher price, potentially getting closer to your desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a compromise on both our sides.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show you're flexible:** You've lowered your price, indicating you're willing to compromise.
* **Stay within a reasonable range:** The price is still within Bob's budget and higher than your minimum.
* **Maintain leverage:** You haven't dropped your price too significantly, keeping some bargaining power.

This approach aims to push for a more favorable price while keeping the negotiation open and maintaining a positive dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're making progress. I'm willing to pay $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly lower than your last counteroffer,  accepting it is the best strategy at this point. 

* **You're getting a good price:** $960,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000 and relatively close to your desired price.
* **The negotiation might stall:** Continuing to reject offers and counteroffer could risk Bob walking away altogether.
* **It's a compromise:** By accepting, you're showing flexibility and reaching a mutually acceptable price.

Considering the potential for a stalemate and the already high price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option to secure a sale and maximize your earnings."
