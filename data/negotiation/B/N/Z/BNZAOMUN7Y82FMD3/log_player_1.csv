Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal without either of us having to walk away. Let's make this happen.

While $1,062,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer."
