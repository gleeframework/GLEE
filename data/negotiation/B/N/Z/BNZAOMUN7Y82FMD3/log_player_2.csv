"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob has a better option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so he should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal without either of us having to walk away. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,062,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,070,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a good middle ground between our last offers, and I believe it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the negotiation with Alice has stalled.  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and while they are getting closer, it's unlikely that they will reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds.  

Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the most financially sensible decision.  This guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget and avoids potentially losing more time and effort negotiating with Alice."
