"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a price of $11,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially save money by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or increase the price again.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
