Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still exceeding my minimum value.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but is a considerable drop from my initial price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I get a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get more than $1,000,000, Bob's counteroffer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so that's the best option."
