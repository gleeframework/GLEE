"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards your $100 limit, especially since you have the option to buy from John at that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and establishes your desired price range.
* **Polite and Open:**  The tone is important. Being polite and expressing continued interest can encourage Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You always have the option to buy from John at $100 if Alice completely rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $102.50 is still above your target price. You're very close to what you're willing to pay from John. Let's see if we can get Alice a little closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100 even? That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  You're holding your ground at your maximum price, making it clear this is your limit.
* **Justification:** You've provided a reason (""tight budget""), which adds a touch of pressure.
* **Last Chance:** By saying ""best I can do,"" you signal to Alice that this is likely your final offer before you consider John."
