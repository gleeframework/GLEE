"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree the product has potential, $1,400,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider  $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,225,000.  This still provides a significant return for you, and allows us to move forward. What do you say?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
