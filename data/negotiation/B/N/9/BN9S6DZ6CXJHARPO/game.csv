"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $16,500 to make it worth my while.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is a significant compromise for me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I've already had a better offer from John, and I'm starting to get a bit anxious to finalize a sale. I can meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",16000.0,Alice,5,
