Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a price floor at $15,000, Alice should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still decrease the price while remaining above her minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:** The message hints at the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation of $10,000. If she had that information, she might adjust her approach."
