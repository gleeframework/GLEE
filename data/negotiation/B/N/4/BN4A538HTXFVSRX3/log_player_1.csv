Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer provides a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. This is important because:

* **It's a good starting point:** It's not too aggressive, but it also shows that you're serious about getting a good price. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob the chance to make a counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's a good fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always go to John and sell the product for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're hoping to get.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price.  You can always go to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  That seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the best we can get considering our fallback option with John for $1,000,000. It's important to remember that negotiating is a process and sometimes a compromise is the best outcome."
