Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have a strong position to aim high initially. Starting at $1,200,000 gives you significant room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** This high offer will help you gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off, you know he might be very price-sensitive. If he's intrigued, it suggests a willingness to potentially pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes ""value and potential,"" subtly implying it's worth a significant investment to him.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You can always adjust your price downwards (within reason) during the negotiation process."
