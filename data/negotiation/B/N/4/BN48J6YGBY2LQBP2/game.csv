"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm counteroffering at $9,150. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",9150.0,Alice,5,
