"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

You can do better than $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

You're still closer to your desired price than John's offer, and Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate. It's worth another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm counteroffering at $9,150. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly firm on her price, and  $9,150 is still a decent deal compared to John's offer of $10,000. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing it and having to pay more to John."
