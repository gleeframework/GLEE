,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to me. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference: $9,500. It's a fair price that considers both of our perspectives. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit below my desired price.  How about we split the difference again and go with $9,375? This way we both come closer to our desired prices. What do you think?",9375.0,Alice,7,
