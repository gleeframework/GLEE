{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make the offer more attractive.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm keeping the message open-ended to encourage Bob to respond and engage in negotiation.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further.
* **Exploring Higher Offers:** I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my desired value, especially considering I have multiple rounds left and the option to sell to John.
