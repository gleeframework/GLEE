Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,200,000.

**The Strategy: Aim High, But Be Realistic**

While you could aim for the full $1,500,000 Bob values the product at,  starting extremely high could make him walk away instantly. A more strategic approach is to aim slightly below his maximum while maximizing your potential profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps it concise, emphasizes value, and creates a sense of exclusivity. 
* **The Price:**  $1,400,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount (making it very appealing) while netting you a significant $200,000 profit above your backup offer from John.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a two-way street. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'll stick to your minimum of $1,200,000."
