"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $97.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",97.5,Bob,6,
