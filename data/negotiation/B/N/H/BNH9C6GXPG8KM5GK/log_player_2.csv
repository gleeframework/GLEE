# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget. However, I have to consider my own costs and goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12,000. How about $13,500? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $1,500 over what I'm willing to pay. I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're close, but I still need to make a bit more than $12,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is my final offer. I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still $1,000 over my budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's safer to secure the product from John for $12,000, ensuring I get the best possible price within my budget."
