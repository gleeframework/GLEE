"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget. However, I have to consider my own costs and goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12,000. How about $13,500? I think it's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're close, but I still need to make a bit more than $12,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is my final offer. I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
