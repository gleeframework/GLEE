We're getting close to my minimum goal, but we only have two rounds left.  I'm concerned that Bob won't budge much further, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price than I'm willing to accept. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than potentially losing more money by continuing negotiations with Bob."
