"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we settle on $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $787,500. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with this purchase soon.",787500.0,Bob,6,
