"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with Bob.  I'm not in a rush and want to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting this price, and it's a fair compromise considering his last offer.  If he rejects this, I'm prepared to sell to John."
