"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting this offer, you aim to:

* **Negotiate a better price:** Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale.
* **Stick to your budget:** Even if Alice doesn't budge, John's offer provides a fallback option at your maximum price limit. 

You're in a strong position to negotiate since you have an alternative buyer."
