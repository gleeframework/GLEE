Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming high initially maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to decide quickly and could discourage excessive negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach in subsequent interactions."
