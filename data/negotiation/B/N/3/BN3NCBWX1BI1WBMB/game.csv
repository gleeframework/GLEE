"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $72.50?",72.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $72.50 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $82? It's still a great price for you, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I'd be willing to go up to $75, but that's my limit.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $75, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $79? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",79.0,Alice,7,
