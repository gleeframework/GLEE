"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm not comfortable going above $850,000. I'd like to propose $840,000 for the product. This keeps the price below what I consider fair market value while still providing a reasonable profit for you. I hope we can come to an agreement.",840000.0,Bob,4,
