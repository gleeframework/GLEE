Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $89.50, but that's as low as I can go.

You're getting close to your goal of $80.  While $89.50 isn't ideal, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the best move here."
