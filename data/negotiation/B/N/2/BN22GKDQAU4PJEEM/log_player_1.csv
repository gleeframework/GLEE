Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your ""BATNA"" - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. This means you are in a strong position.  You should aim high with Bob, knowing you have a safety net with John.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Target:** We start significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value. This reinforces the price justification.
* **Open to Discussion:** We invite Bob's feedback, leaving the door open for counter-offers without seeming overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is highly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer. However, starting high is generally a strong tactic.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might soften the tone slightly.  However, the price itself should still reflect your strong position. 

**Remember:** The worst Bob can do is reject the offer. You always have John as a guaranteed buyer!"
