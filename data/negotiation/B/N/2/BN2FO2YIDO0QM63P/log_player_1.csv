"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening that will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's also important to remember that I have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $800,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for higher. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with more negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for some potential compromise. It also signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not to give away the product for a significantly lower price than I believe it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not ready to accept.  I'd rather continue negotiating and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him.  If I can't, then I'll happily sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $850,000.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a good compromise that might be tempting for Bob. It's also important to note that I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold of $800,000, so the risk of rejecting this offer is getting higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one!  While Bob's offer of $790,000 is very close to my minimum, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I don't want to risk another counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower. 

John is guaranteed to give me $800,000, and that's a safe and secure deal. It's time to move on."
