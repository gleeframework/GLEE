{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is higher than Bob's minimum but still within a reasonable range.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to sell for, accepting his offer is the best option to maximize my profit.  Selling to John would give me the same amount, but accepting Bob's offer allows for the possibility of future business with him."
