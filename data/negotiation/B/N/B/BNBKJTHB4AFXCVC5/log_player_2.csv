# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget, it's still higher than what you could get it for from John ($15,000). Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price. Alice is motivated to sell, so there's a chance she might come down further."
