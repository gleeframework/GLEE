"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which still gives you a great deal. Let's meet halfway and close this deal.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $10,900. Can you consider that?",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there. $10,900 is too low for me, but I'm open to finding a solution. How about $11,050? It's closer to your offer, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen.",11050.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution, but $11,050 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $10,950. Can you consider that?",10950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close. While $10,950 is still a little low for me, I want to see if we can bridge the gap.  Let's try $11,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, and that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10900.0,Bob,8,
