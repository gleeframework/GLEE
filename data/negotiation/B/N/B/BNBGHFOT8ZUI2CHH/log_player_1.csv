Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation without risking selling below your desired price.
* **It's a round number:** This makes the offer seem more concrete and easier to work with.

I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I'll also be ready to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for a product worth so much. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $108. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired earnings.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.  I'm confident John will buy the product at my desired price, so I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
