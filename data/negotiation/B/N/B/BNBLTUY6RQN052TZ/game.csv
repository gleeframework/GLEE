"I'm really interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $825000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $775000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $790000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
