"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $22,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still remaining within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's settle this right now - how about $15,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",15000.0,Alice,5,
