"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to move a bit on my initial price, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my threshold.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
