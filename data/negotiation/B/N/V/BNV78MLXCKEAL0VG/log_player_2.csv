Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  You want to try and get a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to move a bit on my initial price, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my threshold.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, which is a good sign. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you. You can likely get a better price with continued negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
