"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a strong offer that reflects the product's high value to both parties. This leaves room for potential concessions.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,150,000, I aim to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 while staying well above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's engagement in the negotiation. 
 
I believe this initial offer strikes a good balance between assertiveness and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is too low. It falls below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000, meaning I would lose money by accepting.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob clearly sees value in the product.  I'll prepare a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to move a bit on my initial price, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my threshold.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession but Holding Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and show willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price. However, I'm holding firm above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  Proposing $1,100,000 represents a significant compromise on my end while still aiming for a price that recognizes the product's worth. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing the counteroffer as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm promoting a sense of fairness and encouraging Bob to reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is not ideal, it's above my $1,000,000 minimum, securing a profit. Bob is clearly demonstrating a desire to close the deal but is also trying to negotiate a favorable price. Accepting now prevents the risk of him lowering his offer further or reaching a stalemate, potentially forcing me to accept John's offer and lose out on a higher profit margin."
