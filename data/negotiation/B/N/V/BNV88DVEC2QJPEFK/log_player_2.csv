"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can contribute greatly to your endeavors.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This compromise allows for a mutually beneficial outcome, and I believe we can close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still below Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for saving an additional $100,000."
