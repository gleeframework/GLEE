Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to pay.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my budget. Even though I want to buy the product, it's not worth paying more than my maximum price point.  John offers a better deal, so I'll go with him."
