"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  That's the best I can do right now.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $110. This is a fair price, and it's the most I can afford right now.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",110.0,Bob,6,
