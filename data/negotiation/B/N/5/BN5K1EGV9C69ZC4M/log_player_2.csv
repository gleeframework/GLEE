This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find this price attractive, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
