Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a steal at $14,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, but let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000,  getting more from Bob is ideal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute bottom line ($15,000) allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle above $15,000.
* **Appear Eager, But Not Desperate:** The tone suggests the offer is good but not the absolute lowest you'd go. This might encourage Bob to accept quickly before you reconsider.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only the product's worth to him. This strategy assumes a chance he might value it more than $8,000 or is driven by other factors (urgency, lack of alternatives).
* **Single Negotiation Round:** This assumes we only get one shot with Bob. If multiple rounds were possible, a different strategy might be more effective."
