Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's unlikely he'd reject this offer outright, knowing he gains $150,000 in value.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While we could start higher, aiming closer to Bob's valuation increases the chances of a quick and profitable sale. Our guaranteed sale to John provides a safety net.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
