Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer at $80, so you don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($80) and his own stated value for the product ($80).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're looking for a price that's closer to the product's actual worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a significant move from your initial price but still keeps you well above your minimum. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  By suggesting $100, you're testing Bob's flexibility and seeing if he's willing to meet you closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $100. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $70 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $80. You know Bob values the product at $80, so there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $85?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This offer is a strong stance. It's above your minimum acceptable price, demonstrating firmness, and still offers Bob a reasonable deal compared to his valuation. 
* **Limited Room:** By splitting the difference from the previous round, you signal that there's limited room for further negotiation.
* **Time to Decide:** This offer encourages Bob to make a decision, as you're getting close to your alternative option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I think I can do a bit better. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate you down to the last dollar, and while $78 is very close to your minimum, you have a guaranteed offer from John at $80. At this point, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is minimal, and you risk him walking away. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $80 from John."
