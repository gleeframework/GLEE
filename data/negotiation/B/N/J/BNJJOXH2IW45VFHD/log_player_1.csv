I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe Bob might be willing to pay a premium.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000.  This is a significant step down from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'll accept it and close the deal."
