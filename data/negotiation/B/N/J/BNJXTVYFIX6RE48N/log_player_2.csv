Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100 as my final offer. This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100. It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid potentially wasting more rounds of negotiation."
