Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) while staying above your minimum selling price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
