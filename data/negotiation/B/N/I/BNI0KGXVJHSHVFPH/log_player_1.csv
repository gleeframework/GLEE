Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $98.  Let's close this deal, how about it?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. The negotiations with Bob are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to guarantee a sale at $100 rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
