# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start at a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is well above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""That's a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'll meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While he could continue negotiating, he's already had a few rounds and it seems Alice is firm at $10,000. It's better for Bob to go with John's offer and save $2,000."
