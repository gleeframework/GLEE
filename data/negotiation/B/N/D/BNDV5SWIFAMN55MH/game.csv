"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $12,000 at this time.  This is still a good deal for you since the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $18,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your position. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
