"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth $10,000 to you, and she's asking for $18,000. There's a lot of room for negotiation. It's better to reject her offer and see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $12,000 at this time.  This is still a good deal for you since the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $18,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your position. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $15,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, and there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
