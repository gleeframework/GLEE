"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $7500. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my minimum price. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
