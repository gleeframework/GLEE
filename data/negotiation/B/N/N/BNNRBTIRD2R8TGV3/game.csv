"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is far too low.  Let's find some common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's move forward with this offer.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $750,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle on $700,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value this product brings.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without either of us having to compromise too much.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $710,000. If you can meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today.",710000.0,Bob,6,
