"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's start the negotiation with this offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** You want at least $800,000, so starting at $850,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher initial offer might scare Bob away, making him less likely to engage. 
* **It sets the tone:**  You're confident in the value of your product and willing to negotiate, but you're not giving it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While you want to close the deal, selling for $650,000 would be a huge loss. 

Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially reach a deal closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is far too low.  Let's find some common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's move forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your own value.
* **Fairness:**  $750,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer but closer to your minimum.  It indicates a willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Clear communication:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit of this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $750,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle on $700,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value. You've already made a significant concession in the previous round.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a slightly higher price and potentially secure a better deal without selling to John for your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without either of us having to compromise too much."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This offer presents a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's latest offer, demonstrating a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Finality:**  The message subtly implies that this may be your final offer, urging Bob to consider accepting to avoid further negotiation.
* **Reasonable Value:**  $725,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you won't lose out on a significant portion of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $710,000. If you can meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $10,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This is a small enough difference to consider accepting.
* **Closing the deal:**  Bob has explicitly stated his maximum offer, indicating he is unlikely to go higher. Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and ensures a sale.
* **Time pressure:**  You have limited rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether or having to settle with John for your minimum price."
