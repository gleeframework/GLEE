"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that considers your value for the product, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,
