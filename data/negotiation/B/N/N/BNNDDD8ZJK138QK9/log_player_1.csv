"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I can still potentially get more money from him, and I want to try to reach a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that considers your value for the product, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
