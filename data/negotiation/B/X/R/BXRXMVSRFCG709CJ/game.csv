"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me.",8000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This still allows for a good margin for you while ensuring I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $8250. This is my final offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it.",8250.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8750, which is closer to your offer and a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $8200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John.",8200.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8200 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $8400. This is my final offer. If you're still not comfortable with that price, I'll have to consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time.",8400.0,Alice,7,,
