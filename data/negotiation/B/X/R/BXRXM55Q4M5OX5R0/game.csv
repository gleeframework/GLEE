"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $105? That's still a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $115? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let me know your thoughts.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",110.0,Bob,4,
