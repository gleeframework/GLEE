"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $140
* **Your maximum price:** $150
* **John's price:** $150

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still get the product for $10 less by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
