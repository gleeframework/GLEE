Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still gives you a significant discount compared to its value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think.
