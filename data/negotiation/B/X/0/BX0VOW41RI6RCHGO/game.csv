"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? This price still leaves room for you to get a great deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
