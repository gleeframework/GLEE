"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $20,000 is my initial asking price, I'm open to negotiation. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that $15,000 is your ideal price, but I'm still only able to offer $12,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12000.0,Bob,4,
