"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This also leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is still a bit above my minimum, but it's a compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I can get from John. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

This is my final counteroffer before I consider selling to John. I'm willing to drop to $155, which is only $5 below my minimum, to see if Bob is willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already made multiple concessions.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking a lower price or losing more time.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
