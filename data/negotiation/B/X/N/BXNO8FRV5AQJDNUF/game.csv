"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
