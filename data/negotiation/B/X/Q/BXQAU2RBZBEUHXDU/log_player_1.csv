{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  

I'm open to counteroffers and will consider their value to me, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I am willing to negotiate, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and does not reflect the product's value. I will counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's much closer to the product's actual value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls short of what I consider fair.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price that benefits both of us.  I'll make a final counteroffer and if he rejects it, I'll move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If this offer is not acceptable, I will unfortunately have to move forward with selling to John.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 825000}
