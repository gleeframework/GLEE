"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's much closer to the product's actual value. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If this offer is not acceptable, I will unfortunately have to move forward with selling to John.  Let me know your final decision.",825000.0,Alice,5,
