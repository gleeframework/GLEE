Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept your offer yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $803,125 and $798,437.50, which would be $800,781.25. I think that's a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,781.25

``` 

At this point, Alice is very slowly converging towards her absolute bottom line.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars in the next round, it's getting risky. Accepting her offer of $800,781.25 guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of having to pay John $1,000,000."
