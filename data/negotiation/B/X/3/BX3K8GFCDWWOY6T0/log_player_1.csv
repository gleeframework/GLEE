Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is above the offered price (""unique value,"" ""initially offering""). 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** The message encourages Bob to engage (""Let me know... we can discuss"") making him feel like he has some control in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest at a price significantly above his perceived value.  

* **If Bob accepts:** Excellent! You've maximized your profit.
* **If Bob negotiates:**  This indicates interest.  You have room to lower the price, potentially settling somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000.
* **If Bob rejects:**  You haven't lost anything. You have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000."
