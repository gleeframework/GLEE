"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to even consider this offer."
