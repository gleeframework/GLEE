"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you showing me the product. However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  That's my absolute maximum, but I think it's a fair price considering the value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility. $13,500 is closer, but still a bit above what I can afford right now.  Would you consider $12,500?  I'm really interested in this product and believe this price would be fair for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $13,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm really close to my budget, and $12,500 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping you can see that this price is fair for both of us. It's a win-win situation!",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one more offer: I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $500, and I'll sell the product to you for $12,750. It's the best deal I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for you.",12750.0,Alice,7,
