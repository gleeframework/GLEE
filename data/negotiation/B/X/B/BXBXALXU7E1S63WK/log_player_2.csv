"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It makes more sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you showing me the product. However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  That's my absolute maximum, but I think it's a fair price considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my budget.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before potentially going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your flexibility. $13,500 is closer, but still a bit above what I can afford right now.  Would you consider $12,500?  I'm really interested in this product and believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $13,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, $13,000 is still too high. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get it down to $12,500, which is still a decent price considering my maximum budget. If Alice doesn't budge, I'll just buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm really close to my budget, and $12,500 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping you can see that this price is fair for both of us. It's a win-win situation!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one more offer: I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $500, and I'll sell the product to you for $12,750. It's the best deal I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still a bit above my budget, and I've already reached my limit with my counteroffers.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John is offering me the product for my maximum budget, so I'll go ahead and buy from him to ensure I get the product within my budget."
