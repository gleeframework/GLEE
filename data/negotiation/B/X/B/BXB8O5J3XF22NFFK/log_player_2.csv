"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within his budget. This shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal and signals his willingness to negotiate. It's also a reasonable starting point, as it's halfway between John's offer and Alice's first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's, and Bob is trying to get the best possible price.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to minimize the price. He's shown that he's willing to negotiate, and his counteroffer is now closer to Alice's price. This shows flexibility, while still aiming for a price closer to John's offer. This is a good strategy for building momentum towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and there's still room for Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, but still keeping it lower than Alice's latest offer. This strategy demonstrates that he's actively trying to negotiate a fair price.  He's also showing Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway, which could encourage her to accept a deal. It's a calculated risk, but it could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is not budging much, and Bob has already had 6 rounds of negotiation.  He's making progress, but Alice's offers are getting closer to his budget.  He has just two rounds left, and there is a risk that Alice might keep rejecting his offers, forcing him to accept a price higher than what he wants. 

Given this, it's more strategic for Bob to go with John's offer and secure the product for $1,000,000.  This ensures he gets a good deal within his budget and avoids the potential risk of ending up with a higher price after all the negotiation."
