"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $11,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,250. This offer balances its worth with your interest. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm confident $10,250 is fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he might be able to squeeze out another few hundred dollars by continuing to counteroffer, the risk of Alice walking away and him having to buy from John for a higher price is too high. Accepting the $10,000 offer ensures he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
