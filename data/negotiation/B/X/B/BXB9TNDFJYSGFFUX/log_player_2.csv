"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is significantly overpriced at $150. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting this offer is the best move."
