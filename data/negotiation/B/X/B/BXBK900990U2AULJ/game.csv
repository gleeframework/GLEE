"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Let's say $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more cautious with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, my absolute final offer. This is a significant discount and a deal you won't find elsewhere.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no more. I hope we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
