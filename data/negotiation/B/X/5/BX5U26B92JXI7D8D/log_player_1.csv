Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true value and potential."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting with a higher offer gives us room to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:**  By initially offering a high price of $20,000, we set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. This might make subsequent counter-offers (if he bargains) seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $15,000, especially if he perceives the product's value differently or has an urgent need for it.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has some flexibility in her pricing and is willing to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer."
