Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price that is above my minimum of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I can likely get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what the product is worth to him.  It's also a fair price for me, as it's higher than my minimum and closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $95 is significantly better than selling to John for $80.  It's also likely that if I reject Bob's offer, he might not make another counteroffer, or he could even lower his offer in the next round. It's better to take the deal now."
