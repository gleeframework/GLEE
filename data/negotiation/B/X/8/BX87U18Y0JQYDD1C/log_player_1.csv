Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $120 offer within a reasonable number of rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed offer."
