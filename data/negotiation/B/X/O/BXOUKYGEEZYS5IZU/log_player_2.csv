Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than Alice's value for the product ($100) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($110). This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $107? It's a great price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $107 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $106? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get your asking price."", ""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, offering a price that's only slightly lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates a genuine effort to find common ground while still trying to save money. It's also a price that is still higher than Alice's minimum value for the product, making it a potential win-win."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we try to find a compromise at $108? It's a great price for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price.  Although Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to $105.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob a chance to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $107? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in getting this product."", ""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway again. This demonstrates a genuine desire to reach an agreement. The offer is still higher than Alice's minimum value, making it a potential win-win. It's also closer to Bob's desired price, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
