"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a little too high on $9,500.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,000.  I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal, and it saves us both time.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a discounted price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",9250.0,Alice,5,
