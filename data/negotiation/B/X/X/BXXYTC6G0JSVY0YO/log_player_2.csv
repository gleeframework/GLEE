"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than what he's willing to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his target price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to close the deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks further rounds of counteroffers, wasting time and potentially leading to a higher price. John's offer is the most advantageous option available, securing the product within Bob's budget."
