"Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'd like to discuss further and see if we can meet in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on that.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $8500, which would be $7750. Can we discuss further?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still hoping for a lower price, but $7750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and meet at $8125? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $7500, which is a bit closer to my target. Can we discuss further?",7500.0,Bob,6,
