"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,200,000 is less than what John is offering, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product while also indicating his willingness to pay a fair price. It's a good starting point for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is better than John's offer, Bob should still reject it and try to negotiate further. There's a good chance that Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she rejected Bob's counteroffer.  Bob still has room to bargain and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, which could encourage Alice to accept. It's still a good price for Bob, keeping him below his maximum budget and potentially saving him more than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting too close to John's offer of $1,500,000.  At this point, the negotiation is not producing significant savings.  It's likely that Alice will continue to make counteroffers that are close to John's price. To avoid further delays and ensure Bob gets the product, it's best to buy from John now."
