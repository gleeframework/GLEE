Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best possible chance to maximize my profit.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate down if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a price I'm comfortable with and allows for further negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to negotiate and is offering a price far below my minimum. While I'd like to get a higher price, it's clear that further negotiation with Bob will be fruitless. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee I get a price that meets my minimum."
