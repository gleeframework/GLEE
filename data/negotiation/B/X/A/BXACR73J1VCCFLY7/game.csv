"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could really benefit your business.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Given its potential value, I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this number.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Alice,3,
