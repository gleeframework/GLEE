"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could really benefit your business.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Given its potential value, I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this number."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is within your budget and a good compromise.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
