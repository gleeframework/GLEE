Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
