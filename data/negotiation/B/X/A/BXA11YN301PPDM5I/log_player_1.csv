This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This might incentivize him to accept, or at least start a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is still a significant amount, it's far below the product's value to me. It's better to try and negotiate a better price or sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $820,000, reflecting a significant discount for you. This is a final offer from my side. If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 820000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $820,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I could meet you halfway at $760,000.  That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000.

While $760,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below the value I'm willing to accept.  I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000."
