"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest but firmly states the price is too high. 
* **Significant Difference:** The counteroffer of $700,000 is a substantial drop from $850,000. This might encourage Alice to negotiate further. 

It's important to note that there's always a risk Alice might reject this counteroffer outright. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $820,000, reflecting a significant discount for you. This is a final offer from my side. If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Negotiating:**  While her tone is firmer, the fact she countered at all shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Target:** $820,000 is better, but it's still above our ideal price from John.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  This is often a bluff in negotiations to pressure acceptance. We have leverage since we can go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $820,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I could meet you halfway at $760,000.  That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 760000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Deal:** By moving closer to her price ($760,000 is a reasonable jump from $700,000), we demonstrate we're serious about finding a deal.
* **""Halfway"" Framing:**  While not mathematically precise, it creates the perception of a compromise and encourages reciprocation.
* **Final Push?**  This offer is getting close to our walk-away point.  Alice might accept, but we also need to be prepared to buy from John if she doesn't budge much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $760,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $790,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you place on the product.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $790,000 is only slightly above our fallback option of buying from John for $800,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings. It's possible Alice might not budge much, or we might waste time and end up paying John's price anyway. 
* **""Final Offer"" Implication:**  While she didn't explicitly say it's her last offer, the tone suggests she's reaching her limit. 

It's a good deal overall, saving $10,000 compared to John's price and likely close to the best we'll get from Alice."
