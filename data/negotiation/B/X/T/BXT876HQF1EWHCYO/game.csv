"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $13,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you get a good return.",13500.0,Bob,4,
