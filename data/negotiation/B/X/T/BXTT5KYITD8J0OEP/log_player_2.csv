Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, your backup option. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice when you can save $50,000 by going with John."
