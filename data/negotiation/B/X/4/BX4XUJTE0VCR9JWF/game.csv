"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the exclusivity, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could you consider selling the product for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget and the current market value, could you possibly lower the price to $11000? I believe we can reach a fair agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $11500? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can stay within my budget. Could you consider $11000 as a final offer? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. However, I'm not comfortable going below $12000. I'm willing to split the difference and meet you at $11250. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Alice,7,
