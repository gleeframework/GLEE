"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and quality.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $9,500, which is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
