,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $160? That's still a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160. How about $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference again and go with $150? This is my minimum price, and I'm confident that this product is worth it to you.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your minimum price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,6,
