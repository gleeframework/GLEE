Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,750,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair compromise. This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I receive the full value of the product without further negotiation."
