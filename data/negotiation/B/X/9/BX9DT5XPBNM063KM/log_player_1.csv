Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to someone like you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price of $8,000.
* **Aiming High, But Reasonable:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. However, it's still a price that nets us a $4,000 profit.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000. This eliminates the risk of being left with nothing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  Adjusting the tone of the message (more formal, casual, etc.)  might be necessary depending on Bob's personality and your existing relationship with him. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and having a strategy for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement is key."
