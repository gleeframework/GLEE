"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000.  This is a fair offer considering the product's potential ROI for your business.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can do $1,375,000. That's a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,375,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,625,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,625,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't justify going that high. My absolute limit is $1,450,000. If you can make that work, we have a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
