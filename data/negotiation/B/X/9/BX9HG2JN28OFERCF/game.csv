"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140, which would be $130. Would you be willing to accept that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, which is the highest I can go. Would you be willing to accept that?",125.0,Bob,6,
