{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, creating an opportunity for counteroffers. 

By starting high and showing a willingness to negotiate, I aim to maximize my potential earnings.  If Bob rejects my offer, I can then consider his counteroffer or move on to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John is a safety net:** I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this work.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is a compromise, halfway between my last offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($125).
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price. 
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive language and encouraging Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to meet halfway while still remaining close to my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not quite there.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price, potentially below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and a secure profit.

By selling to John, I ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
