"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
