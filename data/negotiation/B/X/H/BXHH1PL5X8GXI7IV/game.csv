"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This offer reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value we've discussed and allows us to both make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to give up on getting closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to know you're serious about this deal. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,270,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
