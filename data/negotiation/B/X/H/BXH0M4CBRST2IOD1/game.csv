"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $135, which is a good deal for both of us. I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,5,
