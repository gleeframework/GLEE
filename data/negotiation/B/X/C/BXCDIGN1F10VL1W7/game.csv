"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. My revised offer is $880,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $880,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can reach a fair deal. I'm offering $860,000, which I believe reflects the product's value and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity for both of us to come out ahead.",875000.0,Alice,5,
