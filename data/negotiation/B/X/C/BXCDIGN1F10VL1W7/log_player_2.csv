"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer for the product is $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above your budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. My revised offer is $880,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $880,000 is closer to my budget, it's still not ideal. I can try to get even lower by counter-offering again. There are still rounds left, and I might be able to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $880,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can reach a fair deal. I'm offering $860,000, which I believe reflects the product's value and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity for both of us to come out ahead. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is indicating that $875,000 is her final offer. While it's still slightly above my ideal budget, it's very close. Considering that I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's worth accepting this offer. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal with Alice altogether."
