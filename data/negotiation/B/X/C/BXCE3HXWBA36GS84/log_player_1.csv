Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you anchor a higher price point in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started at a lower figure.
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't have a strong relationship with Bob and prioritize maximizing profit. If building a long-term relationship is important, a more moderate starting price might be preferable. 
* Bob might be completely turned off by a price he deems too high.  You need to assess his potential reaction based on your knowledge of him and the market."
