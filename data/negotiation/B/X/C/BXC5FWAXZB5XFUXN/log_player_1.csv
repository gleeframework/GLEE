"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000), you set a high anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price closer to your target. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and features"" provides a reason for the high initial price, making it seem less arbitrary.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how much he values the product and how flexible he might be.
2. **Maximize potential profit:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you've set the stage for a potentially more profitable negotiation than starting lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees your minimum price, so there's no need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is truly unique. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:**  You acknowledge Bob's offer and budget, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, you don't drastically drop your price.  Meeting ""in the middle"" is a common negotiation tactic and makes your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Maintain Above Minimum:** The $18,000 price point keeps you significantly above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated his maximum budget is $14,000. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is more than Bob's current offer and ensures you don't waste more time on a potentially fruitless negotiation. 

It's better to take the guaranteed profit now than risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
