"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your target price, leaving room for negotiation. This also gives the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Not Too High:**  While starting high, it's important to not alienate Bob with an unreasonable price. $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still being significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum acceptable price. This knowledge gives me confidence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure a deal, accepting this offer would mean a considerable loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** By decreasing my asking price, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Gradual Concession:**  I'm not dropping my price drastically, signaling that I still value the product highly.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  This price aims to land above Bob's perceived value while still offering a substantial discount from my initial offer.  It incentivizes him to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, but I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to the $1 million mark, it's still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss. I'll need to signal to Bob that while I'm open to compromise, he needs to make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working together to find a deal. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. It reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strong Position:** Offering $1,000,000 is a significant compromise on my part, but it still keeps me well above Bob's perceived value and ensures a reasonable profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the fairness of the offer emphasizes that I'm not willing to undervalue the product. 
* **Alternative Present:**  The ""take it or leave it"" nature of this offer implicitly reminds Bob that I have other options, even though I haven't explicitly threatened to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $980,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging significantly despite my ""final offer"".  His counteroffer of $980,000 shows he's still unwilling to meet me even near the halfway point.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a price I find acceptable. Selling to John ensures I receive my desired profit without further time investment or risk of Bob walking away."
