"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,4,
