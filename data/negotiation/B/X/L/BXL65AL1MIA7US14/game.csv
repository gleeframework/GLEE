"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  While I cannot disclose specifics just yet, I assure you its worth is substantial. I'm proposing a price of $1500000. This reflects the inherent value and the potential benefits you'll realize.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is my upper limit.  Given the unknowns about the product's value, I'd like to start with an offer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I understand your hesitation given the unknowns, but I'm confident that this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the value I place on a potential long-term partnership, and it's still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1250000 is closer, but I'm still not comfortable at that price point.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1125000.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident this product holds significant potential.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
