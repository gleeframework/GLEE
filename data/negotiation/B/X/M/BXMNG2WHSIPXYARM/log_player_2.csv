"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $11,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $11,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You can save $1,500 by accepting Alice's offer, which is better than buying from John for $12,000.  You're still getting a good deal since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice."
