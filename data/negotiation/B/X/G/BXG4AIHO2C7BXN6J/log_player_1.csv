Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm starting high, aiming for my desired price. I know Bob values the product less, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always turn to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum and hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm nearing the point where selling to John might be the better choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm making another concession, dropping the price to $950,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. However, I'm getting increasingly concerned about running out of rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk ending up with a much lower price."
