Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $135."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is impossible:**  In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Aiming high, but reasonable:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum ($150) gives you room to negotiate or still make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** Mentioning you'll list it publicly (implying to John or others) might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and your negotiation skills, you might adjust your offer slightly."
