{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, making it more attractive.

**Note:** This is just my initial offer. I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($150).** Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I believe I can get a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering.
* **Selling to John is an option, but not my first choice.** While John guarantees $150, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter-offer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great price for the product, and I think it's fair to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm decreasing my price, but not by much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price close to my minimum.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the offer is fair to both of us, trying to create a sense of compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

**Note:**  I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  This is a fair price considering I'm still paying more than what it's worth to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($150).**  While $130 is closer to my desired range, accepting it would still mean a loss.
* **Further negotiation with Bob might result in a better price, but it's risky.**  There's no guarantee Bob will budge further, and I could end up with a worse outcome than selling to John.
* **John offers a guaranteed $150.** This is the most reliable and profitable option at this point. 

By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation and ensure a profit."
