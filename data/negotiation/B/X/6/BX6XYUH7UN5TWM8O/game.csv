"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe has immense potential. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm confident it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $2000000. This is a limited-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1500000. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
