"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me halfway?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $145 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $142, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",142.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $142, which is $143.5. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",143.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $143.5. I'm willing to go up to $141, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",141.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $143.5 and $141, which is $142.25. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it for both of us.",142.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $142.25 and $141, which is $141.625. That's my final offer. Can you accept it?",141.625,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go that low, Bob. I'm not willing to accept $141.62, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $143.5 and $141.62, which is $142.56. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it for both of us.",142.56,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher, Alice. I'm going to have to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to buy the product from John for $120, and I think that's a fair price. I'm not going to waste any more time negotiating. If you're willing to sell it to me for $120, I'll take it. Otherwise, I'm out.",120.0,Bob,10,
