"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my financial constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000?
