Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. It's close to Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** My message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, increasing the likelihood of him accepting.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm clearly open to negotiation, indicating I'm willing to find a mutually beneficial price. 

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit with maintaining the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
