"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, you can likely get a better deal. You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $15,000, so there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than my maximum price, as Alice is likely to negotiate.  $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting her offer and potentially getting a lower price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my maximum price, and I'm confident that Alice will accept it. Alice has already lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing that she's willing to negotiate.  By offering my maximum price, I'm giving her a chance to close the deal without having to go through any more rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my limit, but I don't think I can convince her to go lower in the remaining rounds. I've already reached my maximum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on the product altogether.  John's offer of $10,000 is a safe bet, ensuring I get the product within my budget and without further negotiation."
