Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. A rejected offer means you lose the chance to earn above your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves a good portion of the potential profit for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **No Justification:**  Avoid explicitly justifying the price unless Bob asks. Let him counter if he feels the need.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down to $1,000,000 if needed.
* **Confidence:** Project confidence in your offer. A hesitant seller might encourage Bob to push for a lower price."
