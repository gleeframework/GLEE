# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.

You have three options:

You can get the product for cheaper from Alice, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.

Alice is closer to your desired price, but you can likely get it for even less. Let's see if we can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $120? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $122.50? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is getting close to your desired price. While you could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer is a good balance between getting a good deal and not wasting too much time. It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John."
