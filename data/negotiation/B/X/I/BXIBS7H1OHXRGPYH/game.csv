"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $120? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $122.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,5,
