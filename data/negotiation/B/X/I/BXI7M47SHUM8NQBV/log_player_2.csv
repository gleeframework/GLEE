"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $10,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to save money.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you can secure the product from John for $10,000.  There's no guarantee that you'll get a better price from Alice, and you risk the negotiation dragging on. It's better to lock in the deal with John now."
