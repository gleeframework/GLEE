"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $140.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $132.50?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
