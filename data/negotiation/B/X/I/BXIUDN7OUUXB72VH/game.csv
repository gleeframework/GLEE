"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire my product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to consider a reasonable offer. Let's start with $1,400,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me given the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
