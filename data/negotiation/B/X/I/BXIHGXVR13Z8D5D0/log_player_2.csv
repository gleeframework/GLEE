``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with your maximum offer:**  $12,000 is your absolute limit.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stay firm on your maximum price:** Reinforce that $12,000 is your limit, but without being aggressive.

* **You have several rounds left.** There's still potential to negotiate a better price.
