{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's valuation of $800,000, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's still well below my minimum of $1,200,000.  This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we're both happy with. If Bob rejects this, I'll be prepared to make a counteroffer, or move on to John if the negotiation doesn't seem productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a great price for the value this product will bring to your business. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can push for much more. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm confident I can still make a decent profit with this sale.  It's also worth considering that continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
