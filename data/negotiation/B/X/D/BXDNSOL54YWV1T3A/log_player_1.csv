Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming slightly below that leaves room for negotiation and a significant profit margin for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John at $1,000,000. This allows you to confidently price higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, justifying the high price. A touch of exclusivity might also encourage him to act quickly. 

By starting high, you leave room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum."
