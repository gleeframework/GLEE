# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a deal. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $140? This price not only reflects its true value but also allows us to maintain a fair margin. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. 
* You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no need to pay $140. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or find a better deal elsewhere."
