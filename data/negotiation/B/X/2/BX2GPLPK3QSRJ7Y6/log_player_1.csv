Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum price of $1,000,000.  This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.  If Bob rejects, I can always consider John's offer or try to negotiate with Bob further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm going to offer Bob $950,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

Bob's offer of $920,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price than his previous offer and would be a significant profit. I'm going to accept his offer."
