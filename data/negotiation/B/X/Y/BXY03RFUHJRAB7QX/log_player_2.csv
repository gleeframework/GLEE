"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair price that works for both of us. How about we start at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $120 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $110 for the product? This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since John is selling the product for $100, it's a better deal for Bob to buy from John.  This also ensures Bob doesn't risk losing the opportunity to buy from John by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
