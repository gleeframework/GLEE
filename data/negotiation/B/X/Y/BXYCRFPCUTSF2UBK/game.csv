"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still more than I can afford right now. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
