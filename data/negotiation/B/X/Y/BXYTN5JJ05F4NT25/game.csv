"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a solid offer that I believe represents a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
