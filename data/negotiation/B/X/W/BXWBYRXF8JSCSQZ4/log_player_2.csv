Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the unique advantages and returns you'll gain from it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.
