"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a fruitful discussion. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $2,300,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the unique advantages and returns you'll gain from it.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but my budget is capped at $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential of this product while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $1,900,000 is my final offer. I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of the product and its potential for you. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  While $1,900,000 is a significant amount, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000.  This offer reflects my genuine interest in your product while remaining within my budget.  I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
