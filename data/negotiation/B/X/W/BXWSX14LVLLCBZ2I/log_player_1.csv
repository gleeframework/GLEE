Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Aiming for $1,500,000 allows you to potentially gain a significant profit beyond your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" leaving room for Bob to justify the price in his own mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  This strategy assumes Bob highly values the product and might be willing to pay a premium.  
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. Having a counter-offer strategy ready is crucial. 

This offer aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving you room to negotiate down to a price you find acceptable."
