{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $800,000. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, considering its potential value. I believe this price is fair and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price is still below my initial offer, but it's a significant increase from your counteroffer. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my $800,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and try $950,000. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it gives us both a fair deal. I'm eager to close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. This price is a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on investment. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit lower and see if we can reach an agreement that's closer to my target price. I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to go to $975,000. This is a very fair offer considering our previous negotiations. I'm ready to close this deal today if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This price is a good balance between what I need to make and what you're willing to pay. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still too high for me. We've gone back and forth several times, and it seems we are getting closer, but it's still too far from my target price of $800,000. With only a few rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to convince Alice to go lower, so it's better for me to take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000.  I'm willing to lose out on potentially getting a slightly better deal if it means getting the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
