"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. He can save at least $3,000 by negotiating.  While there's a risk Alice might reject his offer, the potential savings outweigh the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her value for the product. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. By offering $9,500, Bob shows he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to negotiate. This creates a good starting point for a back-and-forth negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is better than her initial one, Bob can still do better.  He's already successfully lowered the price, and by rejecting this offer, he can continue to push for a lower price. It's unlikely Alice will accept his original counteroffer, but she might be willing to go slightly lower, saving Bob even more money.  The potential savings outweigh the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price. He's close to Alice's offer, suggesting he's serious about buying. This creates a good opportunity for Alice to accept, as she's already lowered her price significantly from her initial offer. It's a fair compromise, maximizing Bob's savings while giving Alice a chance to sell at a profitable price."
