``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still below my desired range. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm countering with $10,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, but it brings the price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good deal for me. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's within my desired range."
