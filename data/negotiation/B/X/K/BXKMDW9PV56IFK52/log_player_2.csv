"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1400000, which is significantly lower than its true value.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up at a price of $1200000.  Consider this your chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know your decision.
