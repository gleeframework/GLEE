Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely mentions ""value"" to pique Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it allows for Bob to counter-offer. You can then potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still exceeding your minimum price.

**Important:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's a chance he might counter-offer with a price higher than $12,000, maximizing your profit."
