"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider selling it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to establish a lower price point. By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her value, we might be able to reach a price that works well for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  However, $105 is still closer to our upper limit than the midpoint between our initial offer and her initial offer. We'll try to push a bit further but remain open to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to compromise, but also reinforces our desire for a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 was a bit too high for you, Bob, but $97 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $102 represents a good compromise, saving us $18 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
