"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, and I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000.
