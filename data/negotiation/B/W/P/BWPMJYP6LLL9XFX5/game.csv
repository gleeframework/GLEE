"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, and I'm offering the product for $975000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
