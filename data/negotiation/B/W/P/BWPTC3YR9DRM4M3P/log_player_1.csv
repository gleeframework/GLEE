Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I know it's worth $80 to you, but I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a standard negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise. 
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the value proposition of the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I create space for negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer and ultimately reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me a solid floor price. If the negotiations with Bob fall through, I have a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a loss. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $120 is too low, it's a good starting point for further negotiation.  Bob has shown interest, and I can likely find a price we both agree on.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Positive Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By countering with $140, I've left room for further negotiation, while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $130 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a loss.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, we're getting closer to a stalemate. Further negotiation may not yield a result significantly higher than $130.
* **John Provides a Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may result in a lower price. 

Given these factors, selling to John is the most logical choice."
