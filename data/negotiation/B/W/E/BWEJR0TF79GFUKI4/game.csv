"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our initial offers.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
