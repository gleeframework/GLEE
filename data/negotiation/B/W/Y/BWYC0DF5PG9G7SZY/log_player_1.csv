"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll go above $95. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk a lower offer or further negotiation with Bob."
