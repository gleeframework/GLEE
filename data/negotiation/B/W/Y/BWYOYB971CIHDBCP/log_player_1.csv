Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Flexibility:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  Depending on Bob's response, I'll either continue negotiating or move on to John.
* **Counteroffers:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll consider his price and my minimum value. If it's too low, I'll counter with a new offer, but if it's close, I might accept. 
* **Time limit:**  To avoid getting bogged down in endless negotiation, I'll set a mental time limit for negotiating with Bob. If we haven't reached an agreement by then, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $700,000, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'll continue to be flexible but firm in my negotiations, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and John's offer as a reference point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my minimum:**  $850,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at a major loss.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and reason.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while also signaling my boundaries. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John.
* **Time limit:**  I'll keep a mental time limit on this negotiation.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, I'll need to make a decision based on how much time I have and how much risk I'm willing to take."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $780,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired range, $780,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There is still a gap between our desired prices. However, I feel like I can push for a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a good fallback:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe and secure option, but I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a bit longer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I might suggest a price between $800,000 and $850,000, depending on how confident I am in Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'll continue to be flexible but firm in my negotiations, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and John's offer as a reference point.  I'll also consider factors like how much time I'm willing to spend negotiating and how confident I feel in Bob's ability to come up with a more acceptable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go as low as $780,000. How about we meet in the middle at $820,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make this deal work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $780,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the ""fair price"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to see the value in my offer.
* **Finality:** While I'm open to further negotiation, I'm starting to feel this is my final offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid further back and forth. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction. If he accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counter again, or finally move on to John. 
* **John as a backup:**  John's offer remains my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Time:** I'll keep a close eye on time and decide how long I'm willing to negotiate with Bob before moving on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I've found a better offer from another seller, and I think it's in my best interest to go with that one. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and that's the price I'm willing to pay. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has raised his offer, $800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Bob is not willing to meet my price. Further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and may not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's offer is a secure alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my desired price and eliminates any further risk of negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting John's offer:** I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him.  This ensures I get the best possible price and avoids further uncertainty with Bob."
