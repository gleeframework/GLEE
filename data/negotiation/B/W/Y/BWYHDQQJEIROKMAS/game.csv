"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'd be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate you working with me, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $100, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to take it.",100.0,Bob,6,
