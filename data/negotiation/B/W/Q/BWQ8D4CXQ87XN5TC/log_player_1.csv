Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $40.
* **It's below Bob's value:** He has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for bargaining:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price up or down based on his counteroffer.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still leaving Bob with a feeling of getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is still above your minimum of $80, it's significantly lower than your initial offer. You can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
