"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $180? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $180 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $120? That feels like a fair price to me.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $160, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",160.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle at $145.",145.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $142, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. Let's see if we can make it work at this price.",142.0,Alice,9,
