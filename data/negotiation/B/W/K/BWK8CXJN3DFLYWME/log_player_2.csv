Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,500.  How about $9,400? This is a small compromise on my end, and it's a good price for a product of this quality.  I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
