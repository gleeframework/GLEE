"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 still doesn't reflect the full value of the product for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's go with $1,187,500. This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. What do you say?",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $1,156,250? That's halfway between our last offers and should be a fair deal for both of us.",1156250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to drop my price just a bit more to $1,171,875. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. Let's make it happen!",1171875.0,Alice,7,
