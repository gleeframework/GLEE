"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth more than $80 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $95. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth up to $100 to me.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering $95, which is close to my maximum value.
* **Negotiation strategy:** It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, so there's time to see if I can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you consider $85? I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $87.50 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $87.50 is a good compromise, especially since I'm at the halfway point of negotiations.
* **Value to me:** I'm still within my budget, and I've already lowered the price from Alice's initial offer.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and I'll be forced to buy from John at $100. Accepting this offer is a good risk-reward balance."
