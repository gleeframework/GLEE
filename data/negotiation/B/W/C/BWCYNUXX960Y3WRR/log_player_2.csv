"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a better deal than John's $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, and leaves room for further negotiation.  The message also shows that Bob is interested in the product and is open to discussing a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by making another counteroffer.  He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's serious about buying the product.  However, he's still offering a price significantly lower than Alice's last offer, leaving room for further discussion.  The message is also positive and emphasizes the potential for a successful deal."
