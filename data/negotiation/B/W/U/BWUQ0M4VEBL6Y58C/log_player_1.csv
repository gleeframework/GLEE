Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer:**  The fact that John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $9,500? This would give us both a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a new price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""fair outcome"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, so I'm not risking a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've gone through multiple rounds, and it's possible Bob won't budge further.
* **John's offer:**  John is willing to pay $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer. 

Given these factors, I'm choosing to sell the product to John to maximize my profit."
