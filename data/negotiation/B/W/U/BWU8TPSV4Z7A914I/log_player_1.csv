"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,600,000? This would give us both a fair return on the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and is a good deal for both of us.  I'll take it!"
