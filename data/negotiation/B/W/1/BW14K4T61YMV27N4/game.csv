"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. Can you consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $20,000? That's a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,500. Can you consider that?",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $17,500 is close, but I need to get at least $19,000 for this.  Do you think that would work for you?",19000.0,Alice,5,
