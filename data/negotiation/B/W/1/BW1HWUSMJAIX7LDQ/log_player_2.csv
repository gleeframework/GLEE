"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true worth and keeps it beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  $1,025,000 is significantly lower than Bob's alternative price from John ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** While Alice is willing to compromise, it's likely she'll be reluctant to go much lower.  Further negotiation could drag on and may not result in a significantly better price. 
* **Time and risk:**  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without the risk of Alice backing out entirely or the negotiation taking longer."
