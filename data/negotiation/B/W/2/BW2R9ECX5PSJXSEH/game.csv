"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position on the budget. However, the value of this product goes beyond the $1,200,000 mark. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far apart from $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,280,000? I'm confident we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
