"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000? I believe we might be able to reach an agreement closer to that amount.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. This still represents a premium over your initial asking price, but it is closer to what I am comfortable spending.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
