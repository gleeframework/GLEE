"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that this product is worth every penny.",800000.0,Alice,5,
