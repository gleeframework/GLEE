,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. It's a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and quality.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $135 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $137.50. It's a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and quality.",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll make a counteroffer of $129.50. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle.",129.5,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $129.50. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $132.50.

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to lose patience, Alice. I've made several offers and you've countered each one, but we're still not close to a deal. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $128. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to think that I can find a better deal elsewhere. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away.",128.0,Bob,10,
