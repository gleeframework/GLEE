"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high, though. I'm more interested in a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,600,000 wouldn't be worth my while. I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value, even at that price.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position, but $1,600,000 is simply too high for me to consider. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand.",800000.0,Bob,6,
