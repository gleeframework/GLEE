"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong initial offer significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance on the product's worth. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer acknowledges that Bob will likely negotiate. This strategy allows you to make concessions in later rounds while still striving for a final price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high, though. I'm more interested in a price closer to $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his counteroffer was aggressive, it shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We're making a substantial reduction from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to move towards Bob's range, but not too drastically.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes the ""true potential"" and ""inherent value"" to remind Bob of the product's worth, justifying the still-high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility. Will he respond to a significant concession from our side, or is he fixed on a much lower price point? This information will guide our strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increased slightly to $700,000, showing some movement but still far below your $1,500,000 minimum. It's too early to settle, especially with John as a backup option. We'll continue negotiating to explore if Bob is willing to make a more significant jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,600,000 wouldn't be worth my while. I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value, even at that price.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Firmer Tone:**  We're shifting the negotiation dynamic by being more transparent about your minimum acceptable price. This conveys seriousness and sets a clear expectation.
* **Justification:**  We're not just stating a number; we're linking it to your potential losses and reiterating the product's value for Bob.
* **Encouraging a Decisive Response:** By revealing more of your position, you're prompting Bob to make a more significant move if he's truly interested. This will help you decide whether to continue negotiating or move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position, but $1,600,000 is simply too high for me to consider. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute limit at $800,000. This is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to close this gap. Selling to John guarantees you your desired price and avoids further negotiation with no promise of a better outcome."
