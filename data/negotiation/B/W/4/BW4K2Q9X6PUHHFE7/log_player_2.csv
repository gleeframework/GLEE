Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high, though. I'm more interested in a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,600,000 wouldn't be worth my while. I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value, even at that price.  What are your thoughts?
