"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,900. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit.
