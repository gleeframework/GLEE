Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By offering a price less than Bob's potential value, you signal that you're open to discussion.

This approach allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's value while still securing a good price for yourself.  Be prepared to counter if Bob rejects your offer, and remember you have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you have already shown willingness to negotiate and know that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still room to negotiate.  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer.
* **Show Determination:** Rejecting his offer shows that you're not settling for the minimum. This can encourage Bob to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than your initial offer of $14,000. This demonstrates your flexibility while still working towards a favorable price."
