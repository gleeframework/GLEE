"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  I believe this product will bring you a lot of value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,500?  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
