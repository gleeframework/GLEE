Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

It's clear Bob is unlikely to meet the $12,000 threshold.  It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
