Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the value the product will bring to my business, while also being more in line with my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,225,000 is a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm proposing $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offers continually decreasing, the risk of ending up with an even lower price is high.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, even if it's not my ideal outcome.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
