Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum selling price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down if he wants, potentially landing on a price still above my minimum.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing out. I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. 

By offering the product at $11,500, I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
