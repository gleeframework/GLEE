"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $850,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  This will allow me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers.  I'm also emphasizing the value to him, hoping to make the offer seem more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. I would like to propose an offer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still within a reasonable range. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $850,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not willing to settle for $750,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
