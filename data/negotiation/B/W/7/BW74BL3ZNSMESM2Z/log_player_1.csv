Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more. Aiming slightly below your guaranteed price might secure a quicker sale and slightly higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,999 is a common pricing tactic that makes the offer feel more appealing than a round $12,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially meet in the middle. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes a quick and straightforward transaction with John is guaranteed. If there's any risk of that deal falling through, it might be wiser to offer a lower price to Bob to ensure a sale."
