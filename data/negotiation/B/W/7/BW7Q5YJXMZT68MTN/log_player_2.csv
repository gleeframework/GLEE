"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price or choose the alternative option of buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is too low for me.  Could you do $160? I'm willing to be flexible if we can reach a fair price.

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum of $100. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
