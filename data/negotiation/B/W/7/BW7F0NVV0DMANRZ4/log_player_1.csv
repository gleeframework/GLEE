"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that you're serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  There's room to negotiate further.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to try and get closer to a price that reflects the true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving slightly closer to Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. I believe this offer is fair considering the value to Bob and the potential to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below the product's worth to him and my minimum acceptable price.  With 6 rounds remaining, I am willing to risk continuing negotiations to see if I can get a higher price.  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to go higher, especially if he wants to secure the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to secure a price that's closer to the value of the product to him. With 5 rounds left, I think this is a reasonable counteroffer that shows I'm flexible while also trying to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is now only $20,000 less than my previous counteroffer. This means we are very close to a deal. Furthermore, accepting his offer will result in a higher profit than selling to John.  It's more profitable to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
