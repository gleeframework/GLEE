"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's budget and his goal is to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's budget:** $875,000 is only $75,000 above Bob's maximum price of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:**  It's possible that Alice won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate might just waste time. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not be willing to negotiate further. This could force Bob to buy from John, which wouldn't save him as much money.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a good deal, and it's unlikely he can get a significantly better price through further negotiation."
