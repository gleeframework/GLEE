Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which still leaves a good profit margin for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
