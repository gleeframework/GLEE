"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which still leaves a good profit margin for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
