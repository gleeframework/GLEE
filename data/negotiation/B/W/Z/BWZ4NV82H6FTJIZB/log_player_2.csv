Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and leaves you with a significant profit margin.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially leading to a deal with John at a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for you."
