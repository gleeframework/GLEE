"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay.  John offers the product at your maximum price, so it makes the most sense to buy from him."
