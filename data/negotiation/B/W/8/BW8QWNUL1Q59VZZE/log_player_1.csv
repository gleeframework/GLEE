"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using a question to make it clear that I'm open to negotiating. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($100) as possible while still keeping Bob engaged. I'll adjust my offers based on his responses, but I'll always have the option to sell to John if the negotiation stalls or I feel I can't get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum value of $100. Accepting this offer would mean taking a loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price with further rounds.
* **John is a Backup Option:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, John is a reliable alternative if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving halfway from my previous offer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the new price and the value Bob will receive.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I'm reiterating my belief in the product's value to keep Bob engaged. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm hoping to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to negotiate in the next round, but I'll be prepared to adjust my offer again to reach an agreement. I'll also continue to keep John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While it's closer, accepting would mean selling at a loss.
* **Further Negotiation Possible:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and is showing a strong interest in the product. There's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us.
* **John is a Safe Backup:**  I'm comfortable holding out for a better price, knowing I can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. I will continue to assess Bob's commitment and willingness to negotiate while keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I really want to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. How about $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can comfortably afford.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Urgency and Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the need to ""close this deal"" and framing the offer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I'm reiterating my belief in the value of the product, but also acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.

**Strategy:** 

I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. However, I'm still prepared to continue negotiating in the next rounds if necessary.  John's offer remains my fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down."
