{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $120 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $110 is still a good deal for Bob, and I think I can push a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $112? It's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. How about we meet at $108? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $108 is still above my minimum of $100 and  getting closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer completely."
