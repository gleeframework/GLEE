"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. There's no harm in rejecting her initial offer and seeing if she's willing to lower her price. You have 9 more rounds to try and get a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I hope this will encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial position, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, as I have more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my target. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and I hope this will encourage her to accept."
