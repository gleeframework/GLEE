"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Bob,4,
