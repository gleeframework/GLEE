Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is a good compromise between my minimum price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Negotiation space:**  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection from Bob. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage and prevents me from accepting offers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have a chance to improve the price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer:** I can still sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:** $10,500 is still above my minimum price of $12,000, and it's closer to my initial assessment of the product's worth.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not giving away too much, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.  I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if this counteroffer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,800 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further price reductions, which I'm not willing to accept.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is my minimum requirement.

By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob and ensure I achieve my desired profit."
