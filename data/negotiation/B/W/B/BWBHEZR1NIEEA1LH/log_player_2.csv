"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  $120 (Alice's price) is less than $150 (John's price).
* **It's still within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $150, so $120 is a good deal."
