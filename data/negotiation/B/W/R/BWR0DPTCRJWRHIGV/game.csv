"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a compromise to close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to see a price closer to $1600000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1600000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
