Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $800000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $750000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $820000. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $820000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $780000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my limit, Alice. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $795000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000",795000.0,Bob,10,
