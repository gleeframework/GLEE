"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive to Bob while allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell immediately for that price. There's a chance I can get closer to my initial offer or at least get a better deal in the next rounds.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of the product for you, I'm willing to go down to $13,500. Let's find a middle ground and make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. How about $13,000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $13,000 is still a bit too high. How about $12,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds.  It's likely I won't get a better offer, and accepting this offer is a good compromise."
