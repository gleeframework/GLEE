"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $500,000 is far too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount from what I value the product at.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
