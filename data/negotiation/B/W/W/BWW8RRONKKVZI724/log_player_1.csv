Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on the price."", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but slightly below your guaranteed price gives the impression the product is valuable while leaving a small window for Bob to negotiate (which he won't do, knowing his maximum is much lower).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $15,000. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer appear appealing."
