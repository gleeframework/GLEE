"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $11,200?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,200, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Bob,4,
