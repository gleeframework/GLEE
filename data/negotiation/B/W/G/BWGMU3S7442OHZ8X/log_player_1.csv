Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is high but still leaves room for potential compromise. It is above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's a good chance he'll consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only $1,000 below your initial price. It's still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and further negotiation may not lead to a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit."
