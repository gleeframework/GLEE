"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we begin, I'd like to make an offer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering the market value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a discount.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits I can get from the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits you'll get from the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
