"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
