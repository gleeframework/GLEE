Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my maximum budget, let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
