"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my maximum budget, let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my position requires me to aim for a higher price point.  Could you consider $1,600,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns on your investment.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my genuine interest, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering both our needs. Let's bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be candid, I'm facing pressure to close this deal quickly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with the best option for my business. ",1550000.0,Alice,5,
