"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm very interested in the product, $1,000,000 is quite steep.  Would you consider $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also establishes a starting point that's closer to your target budget.
* **Polite and Positive:** The message aims to maintain a good negotiating relationship by being appreciative and expressing continued interest. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't reveal your absolute maximum budget, leaving you flexibility for future counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  It's a very valuable item, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving you a significant discount.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $850,000 is still above both your target price and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to bring the price down further. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John's offer as a backup gives you a strong position to push back on Alice's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? This offer represents a significant investment on my part and a fair compromise between our positions."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to meet Alice closer to the middle ground between her last offer ($850,000) and your previous offer ($650,000). 
* **Budget-Conscious but Serious:**  You're still emphasizing your budget limitations, but the message conveys your seriousness about purchasing the product. 
* **Leaving Room to Maneuver:** This counteroffer leaves you with some room to potentially increase your offer slightly, while still staying below John's price if needed."
