I would like to propose an alternative that might work for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $1100000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still showing appreciation for the value you're offering.

However, I notice that the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price is decreasing, and I want to try to close the deal. I will make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price.
