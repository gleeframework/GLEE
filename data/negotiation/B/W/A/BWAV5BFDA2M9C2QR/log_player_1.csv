{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a starting point that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I get a decent profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving the decision to Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high offer to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then counteroffer based on his response.  If the negotiations stall or become unproductive, I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value it brings to me. Let me know if you're open to discussing this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to get the best deal possible, I'm not willing to sacrifice my minimum price point. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price that's still within a reasonable range, keeping the negotiations open. This allows me to explore if there's any room for compromise while protecting my minimum profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go below $950,000 for the product. It's still a significant discount from my initial price, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $950,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a price that's still profitable for me but might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Message:** The message is firm yet conciliatory, acknowledging Bob's position but emphasizing the value proposition and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that meets my minimum requirements. This strategy aims to keep the negotiations open while increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your position, $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the point where I'm comfortable selling.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a middle ground, but I won't accept an offer below $1,000,000 at this point. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John.  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about finding a fair price but also that I'm not willing to settle for anything less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $925,000 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer but still significantly below my initial price. This offers a compromise and signals my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is positive and focused on reaching a mutually agreeable solution. It emphasizes the value of the product and highlights the benefit of closing the deal.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer closer to Bob's last offer, I'm showing that I'm willing to be flexible. This strategy aims to close the gap and potentially secure a deal without sacrificing too much of my desired profit. However, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable."
