Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. 
    * Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its value to him.
    * You make a $150,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
