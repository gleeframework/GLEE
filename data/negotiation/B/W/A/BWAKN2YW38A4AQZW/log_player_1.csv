Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but $950,000 is simply not enough. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the flexibility shown. However, based on my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1,025,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which I believe is closer to the value you place on the product and within my budget range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's a fair price for the product.  Selling to John would result in the same price, but I want to give Bob the opportunity to purchase the product."
