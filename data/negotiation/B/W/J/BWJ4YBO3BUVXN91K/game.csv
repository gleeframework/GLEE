"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,250.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
