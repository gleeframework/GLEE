Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the price is getting closer to his target, and there's a risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and potentially raising the price."
