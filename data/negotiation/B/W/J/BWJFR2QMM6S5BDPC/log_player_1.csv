"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105, but I'd really like to get it for less than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105, but I'd really like to get it for $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

At this point, Bob is unwilling to meet above your minimum price. There's no guarantee further negotiation will get you a better offer, and it's not worth the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers.  Selling to John guarantees you meet your minimum acceptable price."
