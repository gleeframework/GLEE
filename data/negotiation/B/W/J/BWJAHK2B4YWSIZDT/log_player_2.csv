Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet at $14,000?

We're getting closer, but I think there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with, and I think we're getting close. To seal the deal, how about we settle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($14,000) and my previous counteroffer ($12,000). It shows a willingness to compromise but also holds firm on seeking a significant discount.
* **Sense of urgency:**  By phrasing it as ""to seal the deal,""  I'm implying I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer if we can't agree soon.
* **Respectful tone:** Maintaining a positive and appreciative tone encourages continued negotiation."
