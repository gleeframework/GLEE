Round 2

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it still leaves room for you to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.
