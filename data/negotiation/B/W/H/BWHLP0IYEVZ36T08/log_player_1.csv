Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. If Bob is genuinely interested, he should be willing to negotiate from here. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue the negotiation or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'd prefer to avoid selling to John, his offer is still within my acceptable range.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his.  I'm still above my minimum value, and I believe this offer is fair considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation.  I don't want to risk him continuing to lowball me.  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is not ideal, it's the most reliable option at this point to ensure I don't lose out on a profitable sale."
