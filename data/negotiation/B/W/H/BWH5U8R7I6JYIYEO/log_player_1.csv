Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, though...

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly signaling he has a firm ceiling and is considering alternatives. Accepting $1,500,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
