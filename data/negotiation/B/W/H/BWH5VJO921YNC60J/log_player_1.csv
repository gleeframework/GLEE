"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, and my minimum is $1,000,000, starting significantly above both allows room for negotiation. It also establishes a strong initial position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option (John):**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I won't settle for anything less than that.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while remaining realistic and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting now would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob didn't meet my initial ask, his counter-offer shows he's serious and willing to negotiate.  There are still 8 rounds left to try and bridge the gap. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have John's offer gives me the confidence to decline and propose a counter-offer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $150,000, which shows flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This counter-offer keeps me well above my $1,000,000 minimum and sets a strong position for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a strong position and reminding Bob of the product's inherent worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while still staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 remains below my $1,000,000 threshold. Accepting now would still result in a loss compared to selling to John.
* **Positive Negotiation Trajectory:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating his strong interest in the product. This suggests further negotiation could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Remaining:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's still reasonable time to try and bridge the gap between our positions. 

I'll aim to counter-offer close to my minimum, but leave some room for a final round of negotiation if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to see a fair return on this valuable product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** This counter-offer is strategically placed just slightly above my $1,000,000 minimum. It aims to maximize my profit while still offering Bob a seemingly attractive deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is my final offer, I introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce that my price is justified, even though it's slightly above his previous offer.

This approach aims to either close the deal at a profitable price or prompt Bob to reveal how much he's truly willing to pay. It also leaves me the option to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer remains below my $1,000,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a loss compared to John's offer.
* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is negotiating, his increments are small, and he's consistently staying below my minimum. This suggests it's unlikely he'll meet my price even with more rounds.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's offer now would be a financial mistake, risking a lower profit for a small chance of a slightly higher offer.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob.  The guaranteed sale to John ensures I meet my financial goals without further risk or negotiation."
