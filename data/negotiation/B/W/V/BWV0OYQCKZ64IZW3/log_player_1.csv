"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1,350,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $1,360,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my counteroffer and is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Given that we are already in round 4 and there's no guarantee I can get a better price, I will accept Bob's offer."
