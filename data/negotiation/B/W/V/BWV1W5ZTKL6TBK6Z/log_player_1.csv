"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Selling to John right now would net me the same amount, but there's a chance of getting a higher price if I accept Bob's offer."
