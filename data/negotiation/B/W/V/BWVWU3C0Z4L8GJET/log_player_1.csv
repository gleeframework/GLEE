Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I want to see if he's serious about the product and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal without going through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $1,400,000 is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  John is offering me my minimum, and I'm confident I can secure a quick sale with him."
