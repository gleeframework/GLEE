"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to go one step further and offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
