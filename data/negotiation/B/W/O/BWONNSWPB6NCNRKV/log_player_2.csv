"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
I will reject the offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can get it for even less.  Alice starting below her value suggests there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is moving closer to her bottom line, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to go one step further and offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and $825,000 is a good price â€“ a $175,000 savings compared to John. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
