"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a balance between value and budget.  While $1,250,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still seeking a slightly higher number. Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000?  This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,262,500. This is my final counteroffer.",1262500.0,Bob,6,
