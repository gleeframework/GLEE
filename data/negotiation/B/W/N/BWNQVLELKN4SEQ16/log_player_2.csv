"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You value the product at $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,000, saving you $1,000.
* **It's worth accepting even if you could get it for slightly less.**  While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of her pulling back the offer or you missing out on the product altogether is too high."
