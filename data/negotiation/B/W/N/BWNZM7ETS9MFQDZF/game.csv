"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about $16,500? This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,
