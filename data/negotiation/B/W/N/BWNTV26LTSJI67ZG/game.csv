"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, as that's the most I can afford right now.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can meet you halfway at $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to pay $10,250.  I really want to purchase this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,500, which is closer to my minimum price, but still a good deal for you. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $11,400. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",11400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,400 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering your last offer, and it allows me to finalize the purchase without exceeding my budget.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,400, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. This is the best I can do, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,9,
