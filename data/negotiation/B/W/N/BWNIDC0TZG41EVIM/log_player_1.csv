Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is far too low. It makes sense to counter and see if we can reach a price closer to his perceived value."

We are getting closer, but $70 is still below my minimum. One more counter offer is worth trying."
