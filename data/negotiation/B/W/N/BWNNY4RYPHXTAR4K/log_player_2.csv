"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate downwards and should try to get closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give us room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Aiming Below Value:** Our goal is to get the product for less than Alice values it. Starting low increases the chances of a deal closer to $8,000.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves space for counteroffers and a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room:** Alice moved significantly closer to her perceived value, which is good. However, there's still room for negotiation as $8,500 is above her value.
* **Time Advantage:** We have plenty of rounds left. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive and gives us a chance to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more affordable. Would you be willing to do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We are increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to move, but we're keeping it significantly below her $8,500 counteroffer.
* **Target Zone:** $7,000 keeps us in a zone where a deal is potentially beneficial for both parties. Alice might be willing to accept a price slightly above her perceived value, and it's a good price for us. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not jumping to her price, we maintain some pressure and keep the negotiation moving in our favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,500. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Alice is now very close to her perceived value of $8,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Good Deal:** $7,500 is a great price for us, saving us $4,500 from our maximum and $500 from Alice's perceived value.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If we push further and Alice becomes frustrated, she might break off negotiations, forcing us to buy from John at $12,000."
