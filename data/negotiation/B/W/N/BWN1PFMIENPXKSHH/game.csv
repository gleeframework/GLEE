"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $82.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
