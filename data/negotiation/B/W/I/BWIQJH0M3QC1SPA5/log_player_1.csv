Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a fair agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **""Fair Agreement""**: This wording emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation and want a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **John as a backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can use John's offer as a baseline for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I'm not desperate for a quick sale and have John as a backup. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a new price.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is $1,500 higher than Bob's offer, but $2,000 lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering we're both looking to make a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is still below my initial goal, it's getting closer. I've already rejected Bob's previous offer and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer now is a good compromise and ensures a sale.  I can always try to get a better price from another buyer in the future."
