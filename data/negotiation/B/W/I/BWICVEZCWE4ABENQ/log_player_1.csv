"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see Bob's initial interest and potentially get a higher price. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation in the message, which can help build rapport and create a more positive environment for the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I will reject it and counteroffer. I still have a lot of room to negotiate and don't want to settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130? It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price, but not too drastically. This shows flexibility while still maintaining my minimum requirement. I also reiterate the value of the product for Bob, hoping to persuade him to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again. I believe I can still get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget.  Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's only $5 away from my minimum. This shows that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm also reminding Bob that this price is fair for both of us, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $120 for the product.  Let's try to work out a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get more in the remaining rounds.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the deal."
