"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is still too high. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and her offer of $10,000 is within your budget.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John for a higher price."
