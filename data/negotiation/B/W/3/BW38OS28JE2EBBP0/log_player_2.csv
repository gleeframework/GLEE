# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's a slightly lower price than what Alice values the product at, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can get the same product from John for $10,000, saving him $1,999."
