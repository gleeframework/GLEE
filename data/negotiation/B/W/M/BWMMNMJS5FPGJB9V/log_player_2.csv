"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $95 is still a bit more than you'd like to pay, but you could potentially get it for closer to your ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I'm really interested in this product, so I'd love to work something out."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down a bit, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit high. You can likely get a better deal if you counteroffer again. You're still saving money compared to buying from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still interested in the product but $90 is still a little out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
