"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I'm really interested in this product, so I'd love to work something out.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down a bit, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still interested in the product but $90 is still a little out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
