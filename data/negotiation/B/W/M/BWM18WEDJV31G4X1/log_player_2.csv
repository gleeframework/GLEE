"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer.  Let me know if you're interested. If you're not, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
