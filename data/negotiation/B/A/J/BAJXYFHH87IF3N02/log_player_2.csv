"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob is offering $12,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's offer but is within his budget.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's first offer, it's still too high. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob is offering $13,500, which is a reasonable compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It shows that he's willing to negotiate but also sets a clear limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,000 is tempting and close to his budget, it's worth seeing if he can get a better price.  Bob has already shown Alice that he's willing to negotiate and could potentially get closer to his desired price of $10,000 with another round of counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

Bob is offering $14,500, which is a good compromise, as it's a significant increase from his previous offer but still less than Alice's latest offer.  This shows he is serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's latest offer is still too high, and it's unlikely she'll budge much further. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it's the most sensible choice to buy from him and save money."
