"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not drastically so.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to move if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable value.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet.  There's still room for compromise and I'm confident I can get a better price than $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000.  This is a compromise,  coming down from my initial offer of $1,700,000, but still above Bob's current offer.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss from my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to reach a middle ground.  While I could sell to John now, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before doing so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm countering with $1,550,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's also still above Bob's current offer, suggesting I'm open to negotiation but not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to run out of room to negotiate.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I meet my minimum acceptable value.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that he might eventually reject my offers altogether, leaving me with no deal.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a sale with John."
