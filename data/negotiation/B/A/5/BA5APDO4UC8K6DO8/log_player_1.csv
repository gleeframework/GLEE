Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial value, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $15,000 and closer to what I was hoping for.  It's a good compromise and I'm happy to accept it."
