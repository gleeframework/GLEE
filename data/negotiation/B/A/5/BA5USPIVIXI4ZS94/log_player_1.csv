"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation, but it's still below Bob's perceived value, incentivizing him to accept. It also establishes a positive and professional tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It is  worth continuing to negotiate, as you have 8 rounds remaining, and you know the product is worth significantly more to Bob.  

You can try to meet Bob halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to secure a better deal.  It's important to remember that you still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. I believe this price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer strikes a balance between your desire to earn more and the need to keep Bob engaged. It offers a price higher than Bob's last offer, showing flexibility, but still above your minimum acceptable price, protecting your interests.  The message also reinforces the potential benefits of the deal for both parties, promoting a sense of collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You are now in round 4 and have 6 rounds remaining.  It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  At this point, you have a good understanding of what Bob is willing to pay.  If his next offer isn't closer to your desired price, you can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I appreciate your offer, it's still slightly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer you the product for $1,275,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:** You're now getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, but there's still room to negotiate further.
* **Showing Flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still holding a firm stance on your price.
* **Motivating Bob:** You're highlighting the value of the product for both parties to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Maintaining Options:**  You're not at your minimum yet, so you still have the option to sell to John if needed.

This counteroffer is a good starting point for the next round.  You'll have to see how Bob responds, but you are in a good position to close the deal at a price that is acceptable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit more. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1240000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It seems that Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  While you could continue to negotiate, there is no guarantee that Bob will agree to your price.  

Given that you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price, it's prudent to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  You don't want to risk reaching the end of the 10 rounds without a deal."
