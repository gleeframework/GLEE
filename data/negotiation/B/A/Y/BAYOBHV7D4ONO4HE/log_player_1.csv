{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob means you need to offer a price that gives him a perceived gain. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $150.

**Why this offer?**

This offer positions the product as slightly more valuable than Bob's perceived value while still giving you a significant profit margin. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
