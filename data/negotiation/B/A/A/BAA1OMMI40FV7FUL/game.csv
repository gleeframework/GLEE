"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it'll benefit your business.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This gives you a good price and ensures I can still make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11500 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
