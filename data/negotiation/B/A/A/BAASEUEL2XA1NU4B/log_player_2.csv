"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset with significant upside. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000. However, you know the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice. There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice by rejecting this initial offer."
