"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum desired price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise that is closer to my initial offer but still below Bob's maximum price.  It shows I am willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
