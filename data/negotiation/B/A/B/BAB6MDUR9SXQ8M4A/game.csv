"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still lower than what I could get from John.  Let's make a deal!",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
