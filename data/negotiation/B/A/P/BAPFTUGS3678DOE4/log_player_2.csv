"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you're taking a calculated risk. Alice might be bluffing about another buyer, or she might be willing to lower her price in a counter-offer.  Even if she doesn't budge, you're guaranteed to buy it for $250,000 less from John."
