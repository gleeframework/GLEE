"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm unfortunately unable to meet your price point at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,250,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1,380,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
