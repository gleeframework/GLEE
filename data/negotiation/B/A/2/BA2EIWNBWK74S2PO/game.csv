,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,500 is still a little steep for my budget.  Could we possibly settle around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I can accept, but I'm willing to come down to $8,750 if we can close the deal this round.",8750.0,Alice,5,
