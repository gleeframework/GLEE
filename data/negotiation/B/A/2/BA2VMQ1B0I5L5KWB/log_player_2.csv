Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $15,500.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $15,000 than to risk Alice not budging further."
