"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential and value in the market, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves ample room for negotiation, allowing you to strategically lower the price over subsequent rounds.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close to your guaranteed sale price with John, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal with Bob.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since he seems genuinely interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering.  While I recognize your perspective on the price,  the value this product brings, especially to your specific needs, is considerable. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my understanding of its worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You are making a significant concession from your initial price, signaling flexibility. However, the decrease is not so drastic that it undermines the product's perceived value.
* **Justification:** You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's tailored benefits, attempting to justify the still-high price. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While moving closer to Bob's offer, you are still aiming for a price significantly above his initial offer and your guaranteed sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John. While you could continue negotiating and try to get closer to your initial asking price, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above your minimum."
