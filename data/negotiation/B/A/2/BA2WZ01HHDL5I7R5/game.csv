"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is still within the range of what I believe is fair, given the value I see in it. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our two previous offers. Let's say $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement soon.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I believe my product delivers exceptional value.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to consider $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
