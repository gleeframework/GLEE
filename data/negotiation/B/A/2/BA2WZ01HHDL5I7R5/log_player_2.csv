"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You want to save as much money as possible, and you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is still within the range of what I believe is fair, given the value I see in it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our two previous offers. Let's say $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay at this point.  You want to save as much money as possible and see if you can get closer to your target price.  By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I believe my product delivers exceptional value.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to consider $1,200,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While you'd prefer a lower price, you're running out of time and rounds.  Accepting the offer at $1,200,000 still saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
