"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a deal where you can purchase it for $95. This is an excellent opportunity to get a great product at a reasonable price. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is overselling:**  Alice claims the product is valued at $100 to you, but you know it's only worth $80 to her and you're willing to pay up to $100. This suggests she's inflating the value.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  She might be willing to lower the price closer to her own valuation. 
* **John is your backup:** You have the security of buying from John at $100. This gives you leverage in negotiating with Alice."
