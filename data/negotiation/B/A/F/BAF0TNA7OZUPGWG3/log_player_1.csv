{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more than $110, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
