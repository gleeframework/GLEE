"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. This is my maximum price point. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum price point, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1000000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
