I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item for a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000.,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this item, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $14500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,5,
