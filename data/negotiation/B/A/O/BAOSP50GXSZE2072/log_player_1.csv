Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob is still likely to accept. Here's why:

* **For me:** This price is significantly higher than the $1,000,000 I would get from John, so it's a very good deal for me.
* **For Bob:** This price is lower than the $1,500,000 value he places on the product, meaning he still gets a good deal and is likely to accept. 

There is always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm confident this offer is attractive enough for him to accept."
