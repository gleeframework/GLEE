"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for a lower price, and it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I think it has potential. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value to you. Considering your initial enthusiasm, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the price is now very close to his target, and he risks losing the deal altogether if he keeps pushing.  It's a good deal for him, and the potential for further negotiation is unlikely to make a significant difference."
