Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially getting us closer to $120.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob doesn't negotiate, $115 is a significant profit over John's offer of $100, ensuring we get a good deal regardless."
