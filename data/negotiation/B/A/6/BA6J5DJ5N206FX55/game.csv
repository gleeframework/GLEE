"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower than that.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,750. Can we try again?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit far from my target price, but I'm willing to make a final compromise. How about $12,000? This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
