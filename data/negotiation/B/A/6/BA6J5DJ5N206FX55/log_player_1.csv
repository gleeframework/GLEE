Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's too low for me, and I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my target price with him.  I'm going to try to counteroffer him and see if we can find common ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit far from my target price, but I'm willing to make a final compromise. How about $12,000? This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
