"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still a bit high. You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is still a good deal for Alice as it's above her valuation of $100. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. Rejecting this offer allows for another round of negotiation and potentially a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, so I'm increasing my counteroffer to $115. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's significantly above her valuation of $100, but it also moves us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. There are 5 rounds remaining, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price of $105. Rejecting this offer allows for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps coming back with offers higher than my target price. I'm increasing my counteroffer to $120, which is still a good deal for Alice as it's significantly higher than her valuation. However, it's also a price I'm more comfortable with.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm trying to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price and getting closer to the price John is offering. I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better price. 

* There are only three rounds left, so the pressure is on to get a better price before I'm forced to buy from John.
* I'm confident that I can negotiate a lower price with Alice, but I need to be strategic. 
* Rejecting this offer allows me to send another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price. I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $125. This is still a good deal for Alice, and it moves us closer to a mutually acceptable price. With only two rounds left, I need to be aggressive but also realistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to John's price, and with only one round remaining, I'm likely to lose out on a better deal. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $150."
