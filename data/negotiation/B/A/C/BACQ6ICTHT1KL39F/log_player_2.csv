(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm offering $750,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to Alice."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

While $850,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm offering $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering my budget and Alice's need to sell the product. If she rejects, I can go with John's offer immediately."

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and I've already made my final offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll take the product from John for $800,000."
