**Reasoning:**

Bob has been incredibly stubborn in his valuation of the product.  While he has increased his offer slightly, he is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll drastically change his position in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob remaining inflexible."
