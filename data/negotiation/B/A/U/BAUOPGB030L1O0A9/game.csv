"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $10,750. Let's try to find a compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. $10,750 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to close the deal at $10,900. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",10900.0,Alice,5,
