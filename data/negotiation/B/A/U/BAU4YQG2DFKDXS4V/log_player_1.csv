Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him to John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $115 leaves some room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) but still secures a significant profit above my minimum ($100). 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and emphasizes the product's value to Bob. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob, who is the more profitable customer."
