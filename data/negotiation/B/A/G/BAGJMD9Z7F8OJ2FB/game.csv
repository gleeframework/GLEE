"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,350,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is certainly attractive, I believe this product holds even greater value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I value your willingness to find common ground. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm prepared to accept $1,390,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1390000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,390,000. However, to demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,380,000. It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1380000.0,Bob,6,
