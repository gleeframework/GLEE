Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,350,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,390,000. However, to demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,380,000. It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,380,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still securing a profit of $180,000 over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out the negotiation could lead to frustration and potentially make Bob walk away.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate means potentially losing out on a sure $1,380,000. Accepting now allows me to move on to other business opportunities. 

Accepting this offer represents a solid win-win scenario."
