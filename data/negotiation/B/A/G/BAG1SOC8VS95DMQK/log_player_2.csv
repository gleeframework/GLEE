# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is at that exact price, there's no immediate advantage to accepting. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can use the counteroffer to gauge her willingness to negotiate. If she's not willing to budge, you can then switch to John."
