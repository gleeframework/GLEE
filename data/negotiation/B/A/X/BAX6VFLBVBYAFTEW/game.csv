"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. However, $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my target price.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm only able to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
