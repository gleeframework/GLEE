"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm not interested in paying $149. That's still too expensive for me. I'll reject Alice's offer and see what else is out there.
