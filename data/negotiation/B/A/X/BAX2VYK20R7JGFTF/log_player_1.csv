{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This price is fair considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer is a strong starting point. It's above your minimum, but leaves significant room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to accept. If he rejects, you'll have more information to work with for your counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you believe the product is worth. You have the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price, as Bob clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects a good deal for you, as the product is worth much more to you than this. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still willing to pay a premium for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
