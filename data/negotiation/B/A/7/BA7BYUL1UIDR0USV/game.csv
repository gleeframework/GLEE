"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. Can you consider that?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,200 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is my final offer, can you accept it?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500, but it's still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,7,
