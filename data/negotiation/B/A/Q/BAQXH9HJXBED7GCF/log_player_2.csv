Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $85. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Would you be willing to meet me at $82?

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $80. It makes more sense to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $80 rather than risk Alice rejecting further offers and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
