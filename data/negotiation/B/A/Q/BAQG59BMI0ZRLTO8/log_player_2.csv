It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price. You have a better option with John, so there's no need to settle for $1,000,000 right away."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your target.  You can try to negotiate further with Alice or you can go with John.  It is worth trying to get a better price from Alice, especially since you have a solid alternative with John."

# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale.

Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's still above your target.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, which is your limit. There's a risk that Alice will continue to counteroffer and you'll end up paying more than with John.  It's best to take the sure thing with John."
