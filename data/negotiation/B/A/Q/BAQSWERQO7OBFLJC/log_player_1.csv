Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $9,500. While I want to make a deal, it's far below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $10,000? I really think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $10,000 is a fair compromise and meets my minimum value. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
