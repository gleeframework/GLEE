"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than your initial assessment. I am willing to sell it to you for $140. This price reflects its true worth and ensures we both benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging its value to me. However, $140 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair price considering both our perspectives.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. This price is higher than my initial offer but lower than your proposal, aiming to find a middle ground that respects the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice has lowered her price, $135 is still above Bob's initial counteroffer of $130.  There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping to reach a final price of $132. This reflects a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding the price more acceptable, Bob. Considering your feedback, I propose a price of $133 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to meet somewhere between your proposal and mine. Let's hope we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would ideally prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $133 is very close to his desired $132.  There are only 5 rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate may not yield a significantly better price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price, especially since John's price is significantly higher."
