"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than your initial assessment. I am willing to sell it to you for $140. This price reflects its true worth and ensures we both benefit from the transaction.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging its value to me. However, $140 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair price considering both our perspectives.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. This price is higher than my initial offer but lower than your proposal, aiming to find a middle ground that respects the product's value and your budget.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping to reach a final price of $132. This reflects a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",132.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're finding the price more acceptable, Bob. Considering your feedback, I propose a price of $133 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to meet somewhere between your proposal and mine. Let's hope we can finalize this transaction.",133.0,Alice,5,
