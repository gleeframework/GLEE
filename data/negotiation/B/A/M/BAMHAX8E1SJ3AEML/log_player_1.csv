Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your fallback position.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at his valuation.

**Strategy**

Your goal is to offer a price that is appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale, you can afford to be slightly bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment. "", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** Starting significantly above Bob's valuation creates room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more to him. 
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential return"" attempts to anchor the high price without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might want to lower the initial offer slightly. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob will likely counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, you always have John as a backup.

**Disclaimer:** This is a single-round offer. In a real negotiation, there would be back-and-forth communication."
