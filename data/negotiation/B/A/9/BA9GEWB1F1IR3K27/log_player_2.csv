"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try negotiating a lower price or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) than Alice's initial price ($90). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and direct:** The message is courteous but clear about my budget limitations.
* **Strategic positioning:**  While $65 is a lowball offer, it's important to remember I have John's offer of $80 as a backup. This gives me some leverage during the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $65 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $75? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still not quite there. I'm sticking to my goal of spending no more than $80, and John's offer ensures that outcome. I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a deal I can feel good about."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Alice came down to $75, I'm countering at $70, essentially splitting the difference. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for my target price. 
* **Final offer (almost):** This counteroffer implies that $70 is my bottom line. If Alice rejects it, I'll likely go with John's offer unless she makes a surprisingly good counter.
* **Positive language:**  Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone throughout the negotiation can be beneficial."
