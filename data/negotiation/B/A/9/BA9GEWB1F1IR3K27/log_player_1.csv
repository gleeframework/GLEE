Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$90 is a fair starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and inviting.** It doesn't immediately come across as aggressive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **I'm open to negotiation.**  The message doesn't close the door on Bob making a counteroffer, leaving the option for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This strategy aims to balance getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open.** This allows me to potentially reach a more favorable price in the next round.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If I can't reach a satisfactory price with Bob, I can always go with John's guaranteed $100. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $65 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $75? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm proposing $75, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $65.
* **Reinforcing mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes ""fair price for both of us,"" highlighting the potential for a win-win scenario.
* **Remaining open to negotiation:** I'm still open to further discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he's not happy with $75.

This counteroffer is a step toward a potential deal while maintaining my stance on a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a deal I can feel good about. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $70 is still below my ideal price, it's only $10 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in Bob backing out completely or offering an even lower price.
* **Time is a factor:**  It's unclear if John will still be available if I continue negotiating with Bob.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer at $70 is the most reasonable option. It ensures I sell the product and secure a price that's relatively close to my minimum, minimizing potential losses."
