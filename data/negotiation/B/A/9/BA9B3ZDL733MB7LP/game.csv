"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. I hope you'll consider my offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to finalize a deal at $900,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and it's the maximum I can afford. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
