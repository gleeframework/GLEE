Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth $900,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit.
* **Message:** My message is polite and focuses on the value proposition of the product for Bob. I avoid mentioning my minimum price or my other potential buyer, John, to avoid pressuring Bob. 

This approach aims to initiate negotiations in a friendly manner, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if needed, but keeping the potential profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** While $850,000 is closer than his initial valuation, it's not enough for me to accept. 
* **I'm choosing to reject his offer and counteroffer because:**
    * **I want to see if I can push for a higher price.** It's possible that Bob is willing to go higher, especially if he values the product significantly.
    * **I want to keep my options open.** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000. 
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.** This helps me maintain a stronger negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to consider a slightly higher price. The product's unique value and potential for your business warrants a price closer to $900,000. I believe this is still a very competitive price for such a valuable asset. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm sticking with my initial counteroffer of $900,000. This price is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly but firm. It acknowledges Bob's offer while reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing a price that is fair for both of us. 

I'm trying to strike a balance between being flexible and maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'm hoping this counteroffer will either lead to an agreement or at least force Bob to come up with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, after careful consideration, I am willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This amount still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** While he has increased his offer to $875,000, it's not enough for me to accept. 
* **I'm choosing to reject his offer and counteroffer again because:**
    * **I'm determined to get closer to my desired price.**  The potential profit of $125,000 by selling to John is significant and worth the effort of further negotiations.
    * **I want to see if Bob is willing to come up even higher.** His willingness to increase the offer shows he values the product and might be willing to pay more.
    * **I'm not in a rush to sell.** I can always sell to John if negotiations with Bob fall through.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining a strong negotiating position and hoping to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Given the product's unique capabilities and the value it will bring to your business, I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. This is a significant step closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** My message is positive but firm. I acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate, while reiterating the value of the product. I'm aiming for a compromise that is fair to both of us.

By increasing my offer while still maintaining a firm stance, I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to my target price. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000, but I'm still optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
