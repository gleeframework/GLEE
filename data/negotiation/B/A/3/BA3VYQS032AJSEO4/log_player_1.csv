Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value but also leaves room for negotiation. It is likely to be appealing to Bob while still leaving me substantial profit.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my ideal price.  While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I will counteroffer to try and close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want to secure a good price for the product. This counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's offer, but it still leaves me with a profit much higher than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, so I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

This counteroffer further compromises my initial asking price but still ensures a profit significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, hoping to close the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Negotiating with Bob has reached a stalemate, and his final offer is still below my desired price point.  While I would prefer a higher price, selling to John ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
