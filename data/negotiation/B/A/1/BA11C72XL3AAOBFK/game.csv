"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and provide a lot of value. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000 to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $9,500 is significantly below its value.  To be fair, how about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original target of $8,000. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go as low as $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? It's a compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $13,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
