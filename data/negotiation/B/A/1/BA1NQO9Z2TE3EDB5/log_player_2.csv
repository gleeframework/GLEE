Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial interest.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand that's your final offer and you're firm on the price, however, I'm afraid $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I could stretch to $12,500 as my absolute maximum.
