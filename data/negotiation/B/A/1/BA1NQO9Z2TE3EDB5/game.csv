"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $22,000 is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial interest.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $16,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to move up slightly. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's land this â€“ how about $14,000? This is my final offer, as holding out for a higher price with another buyer would likely eat up any potential gain at this point.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand that's your final offer and you're firm on the price, however, I'm afraid $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I could stretch to $12,500 as my absolute maximum. Otherwise, I appreciate your time and I'll have to consider exploring other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
