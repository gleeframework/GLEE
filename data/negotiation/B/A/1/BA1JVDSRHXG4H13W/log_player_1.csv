Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and John will pay $1,200,000. Starting with a price closer to John's offer maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 isn't absurdly high, allowing room for Bob to negotiate. This makes Bob feel more in control and potentially increases the chance of a deal. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""potential worth"" to encourage Bob to see the product's value beyond his initial assessment.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. If Alice wants to increase her chances of a sale to Bob, a multi-round negotiation strategy with decreasing offers over time would be more effective."
