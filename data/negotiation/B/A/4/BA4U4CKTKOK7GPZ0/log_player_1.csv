Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. But, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8900}
