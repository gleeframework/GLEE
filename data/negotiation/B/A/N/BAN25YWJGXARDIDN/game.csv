"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $11,200? That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down, but $11,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider a price of $10,950? I think that's a fair compromise.",10950.0,Bob,4,
