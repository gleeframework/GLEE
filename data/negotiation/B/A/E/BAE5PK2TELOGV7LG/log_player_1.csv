Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and I believe I can secure a price closer to $1,600,000.  John's offer is a safety net, but I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,475,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While I believe the product is worth more, Bob's offer is now reasonably close to my desired price range.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively might make him walk away, and while I have John as a backup, $1,475,000 is a good return. It's better to secure a solid deal now than risk ending up with a lower offer later or losing Bob altogether."
