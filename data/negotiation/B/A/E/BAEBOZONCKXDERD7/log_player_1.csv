Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  $8,500 is still too low for me, and I think I can get a better price.  I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $8,200 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,200 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $8,700 for this to make sense.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 8700}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,700. How about we meet at $8,400? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at that price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,400 is getting closer, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm starting to get a little worried about running out of time, but I'm hoping I can get a better price if I hold out for a few more rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've been pushing Bob as hard as I can, but it's clear we're not going to be able to reach a mutually acceptable price.  John's offer is much closer to my value for the product, and it's time to move on."
