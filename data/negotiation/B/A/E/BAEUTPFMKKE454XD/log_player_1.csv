"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob since it's lower than his maximum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's high value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to John's offer, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counteroffer with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value and could be a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer and significantly higher than selling to John. There's a good chance that Bob won't budge further, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely."
