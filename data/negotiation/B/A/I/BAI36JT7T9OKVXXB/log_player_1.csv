"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price, and I believe I can get closer to my target with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,500 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,200 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I believe I can get closer to my target with further negotiation. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,800. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can push for a higher price. There are still 4 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can reach a better agreement. I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm going to counter with $7,600.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this is the final offer I'll make. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7600}
