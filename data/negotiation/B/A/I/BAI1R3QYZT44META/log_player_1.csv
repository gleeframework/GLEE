"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me. It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to be flexible and meet him halfway.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to run out of time,  I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90.  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
