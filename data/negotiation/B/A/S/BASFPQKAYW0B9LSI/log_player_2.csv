Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking $925,000 is a more realistic price for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about my minimum price. I'm thinking $915,000 is the lowest I can go. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to you and the minimum I need to make on the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my limit. While I would prefer to pay less, I've reached a point where the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of pushing for a lower price. I'm better off accepting this offer and securing the product."
