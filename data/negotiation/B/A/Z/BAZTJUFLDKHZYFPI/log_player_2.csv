"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which holds significant value at $12,000 to you. I am offering this exceptional item to you at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, as it represents a substantial savings compared to its true worth. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this transaction with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000, you know you have an alternative option with John.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your maximum price from John."
