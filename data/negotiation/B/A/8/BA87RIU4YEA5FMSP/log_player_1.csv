Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we can start negotiations high.
* **Targeting Bob's perceived value:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 is significantly lower than John's offer and still provides a substantial profit margin. This price point aims to entice Bob while maximizing potential profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite discussion and potential counteroffers from Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring we don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
