"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $9000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $8750 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value to me and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8800. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
