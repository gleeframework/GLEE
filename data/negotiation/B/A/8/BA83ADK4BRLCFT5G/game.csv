"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob. However, I have to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the quality and benefits this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'm ready to commit to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
