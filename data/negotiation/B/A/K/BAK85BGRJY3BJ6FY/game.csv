,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to pay $92 for the product?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $92 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $88? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",95.0,Alice,5,
