"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in this product but $100 is a little out of my range.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $85 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $92.50. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $87.50.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to buy if you accept.",87.5,Bob,4,
