{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you won't be selling below your own threshold.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** A $20 difference is a good space to start negotiations. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in this product but $100 is a little out of my range.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $85 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $92.50. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and might make Bob more willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $87.50.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to buy if you accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob's final offer is still below my acceptable threshold. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $120.  It's a better financial outcome for me, and I don't want to risk losing even more time and energy with Bob."
