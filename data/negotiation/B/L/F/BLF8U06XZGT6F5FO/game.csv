"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit closer to $700,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to get a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you at a price of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get this product closer to my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $775,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
