"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price. There's still a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still aiming for a profit. I believe $1,500,000 is a fair compromise,  considering Bob's initial low offer.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant improvement from his initial offer and gets me closer to my desired profit. It's a good deal considering I have limited rounds left and selling to John would only net me $1,200,000.  I'll accept this offer to secure the sale."
