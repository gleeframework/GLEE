"Alice,  $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the potential we both see in it. Let's work together to make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still above my target.  I'm ready to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a good compromise and allows us both to close the deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $950000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop my price to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the potential benefits it brings. It's also a price that allows me to achieve my target while still giving you a great deal.
