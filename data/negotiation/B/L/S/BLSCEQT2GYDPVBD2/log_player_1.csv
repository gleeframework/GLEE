"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than the minimum I'd accept, but still within a range that Bob might consider given his own valuation. I've also included a friendly message to encourage him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can push for a better deal, especially with 8 rounds left and the possibility of selling to John as a backup option. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the potential we both see in it. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still above my target.  I'm ready to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a good compromise and allows us both to close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than my minimum.  I have several rounds left and a guaranteed sale to John as a backup, so I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the potential benefits it brings. It's also a price that allows me to achieve my target while still giving you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
