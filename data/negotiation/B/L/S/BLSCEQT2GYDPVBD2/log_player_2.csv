Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $950000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop my price to $1000000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached $1,000,000, which is the same price John is offering.  It's not ideal to pay the full amount, but there's a high chance I'll never get Alice to go lower. It's time to take the safe route and buy from John to ensure I get the product within the allotted rounds."
