"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, given its features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $100 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still negotiate lower.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives Bob another chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $105. I'm confident that's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 105}
