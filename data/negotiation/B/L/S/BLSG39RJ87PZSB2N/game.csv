"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to compromise, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than that, considering the potential benefits you've mentioned.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
