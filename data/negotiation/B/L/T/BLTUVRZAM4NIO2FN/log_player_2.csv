"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  $13,000 is still above Alice's value of $10,000, so there is room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer and is still within a reasonable range considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his ideal price. He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price."
