"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer and is still within a reasonable range considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",11750.0,Bob,4,
