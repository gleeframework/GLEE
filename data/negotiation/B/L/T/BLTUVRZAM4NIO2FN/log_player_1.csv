Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's worth to Bob, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not asking for the full $15,000, which would likely result in an immediate rejection. 
* **Maintaining my minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum of $10,000. 

By starting with a strong offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a favorable deal. However, I'm prepared to counter his offers if necessary, and ultimately have the option of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price. He has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer and is still within a reasonable range considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer immediately, as I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Compromising, but not too much:**  My counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise by reducing my price, but it's not a drastic reduction. 
* **High-value justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce the reasoning behind my price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and open to finding a mutually agreeable solution.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum price and potentially securing a deal close to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is just $250 away from my target of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Although I could make a counter-offer, the potential for further negotiation is limited. There's a chance Bob might reject my counter-offer, forcing me to sell to John.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Selling to Bob at this price guarantees a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 

Considering the potential for further back-and-forth, I believe accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a higher profit than selling to John."
