{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive since it's less than its worth to him. If he rejects, I can then use John's offer of $10,000 as a baseline for my counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. I can still get a better price by negotiating further. Since John is willing to pay $10,000, I can use that as my floor for counteroffers. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500 with a bit more back and forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still not ideal, it's only $250 less than my previous counteroffer.  At this point, I'm more likely to secure a sale with Bob than continue the negotiation and risk losing him altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
