"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $1,500,000 and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This means you'll save $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  Alice's offer is below your maximum price, so you're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. 

While Alice might be trying to push for a higher price, it's in your best interest to take advantage of this deal."
