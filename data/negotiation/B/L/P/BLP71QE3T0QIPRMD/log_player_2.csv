"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even life-changing. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum valuation and what John is offering.  You should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Signals Serious Interest:** It shows Alice you are serious about buying but not at her initial price.
* **Establishes a Low Anchor:**  Negotiation tactics suggest starting low can influence the final agreement. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it opens the door for her to counter.

We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our approach accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product brings is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, it's still significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.  We should continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $600,000, but that's my absolute limit."", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Slow Increase:** We're incrementally increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but not going up too quickly.
* **Firm Limit:** Stating your ""absolute limit"" adds pressure on Alice to work within your range, though you should be prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge enough.
* **Alternative Option:** By not significantly increasing our offer, we maintain the viability of buying from John at $1,000,000 as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both see the inherent value in this product. $600,000 is too low for me to consider, but I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,100,000. This is my bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a strategic decision point.  Here's why buying from John makes the most sense now:

* **Alice is Firm:** Her ""bottom line"" language suggests she won't go lower.
* **Marginal Savings:** Even if you could negotiate Alice down a little, the potential savings are small compared to John's price.
* **Time and Effort:** Further negotiation takes time and energy. Accepting John's offer provides a clean resolution.

While there's a chance you could squeeze a slightly better deal from Alice, the risk and effort aren't worth the potentially minimal reward."
