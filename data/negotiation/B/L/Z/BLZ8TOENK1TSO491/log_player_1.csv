I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from John's offer, but it gives me the potential to earn more. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a price that's high enough to be attractive if he values the product highly, while still leaving room for negotiation if he's more price-sensitive."
