"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your limit.** You're willing to pay $100, but you want to see if you can get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and haggle.  
* **John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable reduction:**  A $10 discount is a good starting point.  It's a significant reduction, but not so drastic that Alice is likely to instantly reject it.
* **Be prepared for a counter-counteroffer:**  Alice might not accept this offer immediately, so be prepared to make further adjustments.
* **John is still a backup:** The fallback option with John provides flexibility and confidence to negotiate aggressively."
