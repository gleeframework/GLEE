"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a truly unique and valuable item that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $1700000? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1600000 is not a good starting point, but $1650000 is a bit more reasonable for me. Can you consider that?",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. How about we compromise at $1675000? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done.",1675000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1675000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1650000 is not a good starting point, but $1660000 is a bit more reasonable for me. Can you consider that?",1660000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we compromise at $1680000? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. This is my final offer.",1680000.0,Alice,7,
