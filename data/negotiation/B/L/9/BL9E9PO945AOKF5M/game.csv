"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's work towards a deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest,  $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. How about we settle at $825,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate you working with me. While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming to keep my expenses below $800,000.  Would you consider $780,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for us both.",780000.0,Bob,6,
