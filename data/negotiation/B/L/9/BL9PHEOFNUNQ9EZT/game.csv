"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $140?  This would still give me some room to make a profit.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  I'm really keen on getting this product and that's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
