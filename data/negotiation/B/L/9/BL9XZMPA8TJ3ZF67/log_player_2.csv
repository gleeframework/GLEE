# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850000. Considering its value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

While $900,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, you still have the option of getting the product for $800,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue negotiating for a lower price, potentially closer to your desired $800,000."

Alice is coming down in price, but not enough.  You're still $87,500 above your target price.  At this point, it's better to go with John's guaranteed price of $800,000. You've saved $87,500 by going with John."
