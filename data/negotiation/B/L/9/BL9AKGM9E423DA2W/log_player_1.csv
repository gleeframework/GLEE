"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate from there.  It's important to leave room for bargaining, but I want to establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his initial rejection, but it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to accept that amount yet. I'm going to try to counter-offer and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,400,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise and could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, and I'm not sure how much higher he'll go.  While I would have preferred more,  $1,250,000 is a solid profit and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely."
