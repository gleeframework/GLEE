Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it slightly below that at $14,500 gives him a good deal while maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 
* **Backup Option:**  You have the security of John's offer ($10,000) if Bob rejects your proposal, so there's less pressure to settle for a lower price."
