"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to signal that you're serious about the negotiation but won't accept a price that's over your limit. By rejecting and countering, we can start working towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Strong:** Going straight to my maximum budget sends a clear message. It tells Alice I'm serious but have a firm limit.
* **Gauge Her Reaction:** Her response will be telling. If she's completely unwilling to budge, it might be time to consider John.  However, there's a chance she'll be open to negotiation now that she sees my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the benefits it brings.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved a bit, it's not enough.  She's still significantly overpriced. I need to show I'm willing to walk away if necessary to keep the negotiation moving in the right direction.  We have time, and John is a good backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can do $12,000, which I think is a fair offer considering the market value.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by bumping my offer by a decent amount. 
* **""Fair Offer"" Language:**  Subtly implies I've researched and this is reasonable, putting a bit of pressure on her.
* **Still Room to Maneuver:** I'm still below my absolute limit, leaving space for a potential counter-offer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is trying to pressure me, but I still have time and John's option. Calling it her ""final offer"" doesn't mean it's over.
* **Slow Progress:** The price is coming down, but very slowly.  By rejecting again, I'm communicating that this isn't moving fast enough.
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm willing to risk one more round. If she doesn't budge significantly in the next offer, I'll take John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I have to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to go to $13,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  It's a strong offer, and I need a decision so I can explore other options if we can't agree."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith but making it clear this is the absolute ceiling.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding her about John and that time is running out.
* **Decision Point:** This offer is designed to prompt a decisive response from Alice.  Based on her next move, I'll know whether to continue or go with John."
