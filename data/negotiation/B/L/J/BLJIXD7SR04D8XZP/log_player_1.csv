"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to move from my initial price. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's true worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger stretch than I can make right now.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $800,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to accept $975,000 - it's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right this product has potential, but that final offer is still a bit too rich for me.  I could go up to $850,000 to get this done today.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is steadily increasing his offer. It's too early to settle for $850,000 when we have room to push for a better price.  We'll aim for a price closer to $900,000 in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a figure we both find agreeable. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $925,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I think we are very close. To get this across the finish line today, how about $875,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are getting close, and Bob is clearly signaling his eagerness to close. He's incrementally increasing his offer each round. Holding firm now might push him closer to the $900,000 mark. There's still a decent chance to secure a better deal than $875,000, and the risk of losing the deal entirely by rejecting is relatively low at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're very close. Let's wrap this up â€“ $900,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to signal we're nearing the end of our negotiating. This offer is a strong compromise, and by stating ""we have a deal,"" we create a sense of urgency and finality, encouraging Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling apart."
