"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, as it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me.  This price allows you a significant profit margin, while still giving me a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
