"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so this is a significant gap. I'm hoping to get him to negotiate upwards, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I want.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm offering the product for $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the price John is willing to pay.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering the value he places on the product."
