"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $900,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price considering our both our needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $980,000. It's a small step up from $900,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $980,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $990,000. It's a small step up from $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.
