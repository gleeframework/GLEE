"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the negotiation with a fair price, but I'm willing to be flexible.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to close this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. How about $1,100,000? This allows us both to secure a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value of the product to me and still allows you to make a good profit. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000? This ensures both of us get a fair outcome. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
