"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the negotiation with a fair price, but I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer and setting the stage for negotiation.  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to close this deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. How about $1,100,000? This allows us both to secure a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, it's closer than her initial offer, and it shows she is willing to negotiate.  You should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to your target. You have plenty of rounds left to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value of the product to me and still allows you to make a good profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000? This ensures both of us get a fair outcome. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  However, it's the closest she's come to your target price. You should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to your target, but keep in mind that buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
