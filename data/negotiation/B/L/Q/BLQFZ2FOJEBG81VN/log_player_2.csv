"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value.** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking for $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** While John's price is your limit, it's good to have a backup plan if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $90? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
