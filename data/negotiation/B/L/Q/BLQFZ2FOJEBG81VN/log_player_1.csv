{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It sets the stage for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter, and you can then decide if you want to accept his offer or counter back.

This approach allows you to potentially get a higher price, but also provides a way to exit the negotiation if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $90? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
