"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000 to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $725,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $710,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good one.",710000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price. Let's make this our final exchange - I'll offer $705,000.  It's a strong offer, and it saves us both from dragging this out further.",705000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on the extra $20,000. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000, which is still a compromise from my original price. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",715000.0,Alice,7,
