Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than your minimum.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases the likelihood of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Confident:** The message is direct and positions the product as valuable.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""its worth to you,"" you subtly acknowledge his higher valuation, making the price more palatable.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, incentivizing him while netting you a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is an art. There's always a chance Bob might counter-offer or reject. However, this offer maximizes your potential gain while minimizing the risk of losing out to your guaranteed sale to John."
