"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's more than Alice values the product for, accepting Alice's offer at $1,450,000 is the best choice for Bob. It's still under his maximum budget and saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John."
