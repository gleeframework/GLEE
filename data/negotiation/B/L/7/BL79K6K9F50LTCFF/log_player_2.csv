"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for a competitive price of $950,000.  I believe this represents excellent value considering the significant worth it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting Alice's initial offer."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you and allows me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  Let's get this done.
