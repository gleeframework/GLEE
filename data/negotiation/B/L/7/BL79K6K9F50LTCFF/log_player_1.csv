"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves some room for us both to benefit.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I want to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you and allows me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price if we keep negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This would represent a significant saving for you, and a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to go up to $870,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, time is running out and Bob's offer is only $30,000 less than my fallback option with John. It's better to close the deal now and avoid the risk of losing a sale entirely."
