"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. My asking price is $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than $80 from John, it's still below your desired profit margin. There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $85? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to make a decision at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a significant improvement over John's offer, it's still below your minimum.  You have more room to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance you can get closer to your desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to accept that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  You've been able to get a price closer to your desired profit margin, and it's likely that further negotiation will only decrease the price further.  Additionally, with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price is increasing."
