"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested,  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still give you a good price, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900 as a final offer.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",8900.0,Alice,5,
