"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let's get started with an initial offer of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let's try again at $875,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit more for the product. Let's try $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and we're getting very close. However,  $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll accept it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
