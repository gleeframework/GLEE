Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my minimum value:** This ensures I don't immediately lose out on a significant amount of money. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer. I'll keep in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer. I believe I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** Showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:**  I'm not giving up too much.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my next move, keeping in mind that John's offer is always a fallback option."
