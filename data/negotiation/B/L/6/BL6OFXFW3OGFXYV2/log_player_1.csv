"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me ($800,000) and to Bob ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm posing a question to initiate a conversation and make it clear I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy balances a desire for a high price with the need to be flexible enough to reach a deal, but it also sets a clear starting point to ensure I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob's counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, it still leaves room for negotiation.  There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John at $800,000 would be a secure option, but I have 10 rounds to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still represents a fair value for this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Fair Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  I explicitly state my desire to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to meet me halfway.

This counteroffer is a measured step towards Bob's price, keeping the negotiation open while minimizing my potential losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $800,000. I want to maximize my profit.
* **Potential for better:** I still have 6 rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially achieve a better price.
* **John's offer:** Selling to John is a safe option, but I believe I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $812,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):** I'm offering to split the difference between my last offer ($850,000) and Bob's offer ($775,000). This shows a genuine effort to find a compromise.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price would be good for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Confidence in closing:** I express confidence that this counteroffer can lead to a finalized sale, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

This counteroffer is a strategic compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a price close to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I was originally considering. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. This means I won't lose money on the deal.
* **No room for improvement:**  While I might prefer a higher price, there's no guarantee I can get it in the remaining rounds. Bob might not budge further.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases. Selling to John is a secure option, but I'm satisfied with this price.

**Conclusion:**  This offer is a good outcome, securing a price that meets my minimum requirement and avoids further risk."
