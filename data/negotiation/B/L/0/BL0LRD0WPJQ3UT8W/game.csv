"I'm really interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,600,000.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll propose $1,300,000. Can we find a mutually beneficial price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price is still fair to both of us, and it ensures a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
