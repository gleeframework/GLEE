{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""discount"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard limit, leaving space for Bob to counter and potentially find a middle ground.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** This offer is still significantly higher than what John would offer, providing me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below my Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is better than his initial value assessment, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. I'm willing to take the risk of another round.
* **John's Offer:** I'm confident that I can get a better deal than $850,000, but I'm also aware that John's offer of $1,000,000 is a solid backup option. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore a potential counteroffer that might be closer to my desired price point."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still hold some ground.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the significant discount he's getting from my initial asking price to highlight the value of this offer.
* **Openness to Finalize:** I'm signaling my desire to finalize a deal by expressing confidence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** I'm still above John's offer, ensuring a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer, while slightly higher, is still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe I can still secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my target.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to take a calculated risk in pursuing a potentially better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a final counteroffer to try and bridge the gap between our desired prices."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $845,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to make it work.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Bob's offer of $845,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob if he's unwilling to come closer to my desired price point.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is a solid backup option and guarantees that I will not lose money on this sale.

It's time to end negotiations with Bob and accept John's offer, ensuring a safe and profitable outcome."
