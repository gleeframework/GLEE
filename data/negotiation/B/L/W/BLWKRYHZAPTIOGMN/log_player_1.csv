Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering what you could gain. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" we subtly imply he might miss out if he hesitates. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging the safety net of John's offer."
