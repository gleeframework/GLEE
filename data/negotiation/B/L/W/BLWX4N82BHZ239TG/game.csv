"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10000 right now. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's a great compromise, considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $11500 is getting closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about $10500?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
