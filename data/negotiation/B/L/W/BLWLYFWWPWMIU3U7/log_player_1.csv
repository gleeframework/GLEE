Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without being so aggressive that Bob walks away. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum value.
2. **Justification:** Provide a vague but plausible reason for the high price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm valuing it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique features"" and ""market potential"" creates perceived value without revealing specifics.
* **Confidence:**  The tone is confident and suggests the price is justified, not arbitrary.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can gradually decrease your price, but don't go below your $1,000,000 safety net.
* **Alternatives:**  If Bob seems completely unwilling to negotiate near your desired range, remember you have John as a backup."
