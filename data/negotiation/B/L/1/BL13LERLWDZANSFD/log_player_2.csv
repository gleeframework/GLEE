"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's priced fairly given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price. There are 9 rounds left, so you have ample time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The counteroffer is below your maximum budget,  allowing you to potentially go higher if needed.
* **Clear Justification:**  The message explains your reasoning for the lower price, making it less likely that Alice will immediately reject the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value, I'd be willing to come down to $900000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction, you're still in a strong negotiating position.  You have several rounds left, and there's potential for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a good compromise and shows my commitment to this deal. Let's try to close this gap. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The counteroffer is a compromise, going halfway between your previous offer and Alice's latest price. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Commitment:** Emphasizing ""commitment to the deal"" reinforces that you're serious about acquiring the product.
* **Keeping the Pressure On:**  The message subtly implies that you're willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down further, motivating Alice to be more flexible."
