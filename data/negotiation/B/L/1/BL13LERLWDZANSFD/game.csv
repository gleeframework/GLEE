"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is a bit outside my budget right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value, I'd be willing to come down to $900000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a good compromise and shows my commitment to this deal. Let's try to close this gap. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
