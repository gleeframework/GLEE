"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to considering a price of $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is my best compromise at this point.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000? This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is still a compromise from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit on this sale. This is my final offer at this price point.",11250.0,Alice,5,
