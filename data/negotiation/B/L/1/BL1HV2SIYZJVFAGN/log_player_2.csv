"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle, I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm on a tight budget. I can increase my offer to $700,000. That's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still too far below the product's real worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $850,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It's better to secure the deal now than risk Alice not budging further."
