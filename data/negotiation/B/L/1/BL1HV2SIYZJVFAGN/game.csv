"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle, I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm on a tight budget. I can increase my offer to $700,000. That's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still too far below the product's real worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $850,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
