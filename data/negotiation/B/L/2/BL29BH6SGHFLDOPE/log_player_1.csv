Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. I'm really interested in this product, but that price point makes more sense for my budget.  Would you be willing to negotiate a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
