"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. I'm really interested in this product, but that price point makes more sense for my budget.  Would you be willing to negotiate a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is only willing to go down to $9,000, which is still higher than John's offer of $8,000.  Bob can save $1,000 by going with John."
