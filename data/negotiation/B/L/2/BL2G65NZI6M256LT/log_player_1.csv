Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Alternative:**  Bob knows if he doesn't take the deal, you're not desperate, making him potentially more willing to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always move closer to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 during the negotiation process."
