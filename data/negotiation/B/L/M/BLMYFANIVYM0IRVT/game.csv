"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $9,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,800 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
