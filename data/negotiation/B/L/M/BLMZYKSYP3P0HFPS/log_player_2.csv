"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  While Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's $100, you can still save $10 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
