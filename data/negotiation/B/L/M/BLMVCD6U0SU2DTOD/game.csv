"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,325,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and I hope you'll reconsider. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,330,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",1330000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While I understand your position, $1,330,000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to go. I'm willing to pay $1,310,000 for the product, which is a very fair price considering its value and the progress we've made. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
