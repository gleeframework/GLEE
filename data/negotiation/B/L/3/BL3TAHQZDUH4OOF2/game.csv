"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
