Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $80. I'd be willing to meet you at $80, which is the price I've already found from another seller. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to budge above his valuation, and matching it negates any potential profit.  It's wiser to take the guaranteed $80 from John at this point."
