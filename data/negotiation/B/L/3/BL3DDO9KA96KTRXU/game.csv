"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer, let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm offering $1,275,000. Can you consider this offer?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,312,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to lose this opportunity. Let's make this happen!",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,312,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,290,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,290,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,300,000 is my absolute bottom line. Let's close this deal, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can consider it.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
