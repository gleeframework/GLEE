Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,500,000 as possible without pushing Bob away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  Starting high shows you value the product and sets a strong tone.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob of why it's worth so much to him.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and ""other interested parties"" create a sense of scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach. Depending on your desired negotiation style (e.g., more aggressive or more collaborative), you could adjust the price and messaging accordingly."
