{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a discount:**  It's lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down based on Bob's response.
* **Doesn't immediately sell to John:** This gives you a chance to see if you can get a better price from Bob."
