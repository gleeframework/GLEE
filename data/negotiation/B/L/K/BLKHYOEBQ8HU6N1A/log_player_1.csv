"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for your business. My initial asking price is $1,750,000.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is significantly below my asking price, and doesn't reflect the value this product brings. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering the product's potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a substantial discount from my original asking price.  This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We are now in Round 6, and the negotiation seems to be getting stuck. Rather than continue haggling with Bob and risk him walking away, I'm going to take John's offer of $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This guarantees me the best possible outcome."
