Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1050000.  I believe this price is fair, reflecting both our respective valuations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
