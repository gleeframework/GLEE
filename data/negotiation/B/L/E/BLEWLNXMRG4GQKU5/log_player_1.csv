This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good price, but also want to keep the negotiation open. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $12,000, so I'm offering a price slightly higher, but leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and hopefully still works for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Since I'm concerned about potentially ending up selling to John for a lower price, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's the best outcome given the circumstances."
