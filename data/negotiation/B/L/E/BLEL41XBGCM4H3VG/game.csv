"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,175,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
