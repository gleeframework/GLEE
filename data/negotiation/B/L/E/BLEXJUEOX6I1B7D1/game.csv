"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,400,000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $1,175,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the profit margin. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the fact that you're getting a good deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
