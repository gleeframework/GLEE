"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135 as a compromise. It's still above my minimum, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, $130 is a good price. It's above my minimum and leaves me with a decent profit. It's also likely that Bob won't budge further. I'm going to accept his offer."
