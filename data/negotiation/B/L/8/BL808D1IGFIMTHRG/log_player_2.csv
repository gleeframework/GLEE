Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm confident this product is worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  Let's work together to find a solution that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to chip away at the price while demonstrating your willingness to compromise. It also emphasizes the idea of finding a mutually agreeable solution, which could be a persuasive tactic."
