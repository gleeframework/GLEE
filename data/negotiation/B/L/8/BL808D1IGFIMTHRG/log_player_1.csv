"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price is not unreasonable, giving Bob a chance to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open and engaging.  This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is at my minimum acceptable value. While I could accept it, I'm not in a rush to sell and believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I know Bob is interested in the product and willing to pay a significant amount. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a price closer to my initial offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell. This strategy allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm confident this product is worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate my belief in the product's value to justify the price.
* **Urgency (Softly):** ""Let's make this deal happen"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer balances my desire for a higher price with a willingness to find common ground. By remaining firm on a value above Bob's initial offer, I hope to  secure a profitable deal while maintaining the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000.  Let's work together to find a solution that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly closer to my desired price than his previous offers. It's a good compromise, especially considering the time constraints and the potential of selling to John at $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer may open the door for future business with Bob, as he seems like a reasonable and willing negotiator.

**Strategy:**

While I'd like to push for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer secures a profitable deal and keeps the negotiation process positive. This approach is beneficial for both immediate and potential future transactions."
