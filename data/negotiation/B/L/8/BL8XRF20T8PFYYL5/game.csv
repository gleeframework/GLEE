"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start negotiations. I believe this is fair considering my budget.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
