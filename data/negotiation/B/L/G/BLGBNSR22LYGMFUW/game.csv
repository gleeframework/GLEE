"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a more aggressive counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I believe it's worth significantly more than your current offer. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a considerable adjustment, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
