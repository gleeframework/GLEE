"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. This allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $120 is less than $150, so buying from Alice is more economical. 
* **You still get a good deal:** While the product is worth $150 to you, you're getting it for $120, saving $30."
