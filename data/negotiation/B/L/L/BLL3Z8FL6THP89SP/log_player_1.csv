Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you still profit significantly.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It sets the tone for a potential compromise. 

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This reflects the value it brings to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. It's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a good price for you given the value of the product. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair price considering I could buy it for $10,000 from John. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum of $15,000.  It's also important to consider that if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will come up further.  Considering the risk of losing the deal and the time spent negotiating, I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $11,000."
