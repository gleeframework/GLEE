Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,000,000. It's truly one-of-a-kind and worth a lot more than the asking price. I'm sure you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but I'm willing to negotiate.  This gives me room to adjust the price if needed. I also want to emphasize the product's value to pique Bob's interest.  We'll see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for a product this valuable.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get an amazing deal."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $920000, but that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my desired price, $920,000 is a good deal.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
