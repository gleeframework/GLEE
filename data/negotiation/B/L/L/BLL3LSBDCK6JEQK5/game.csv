"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on your product.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $8,750.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I value the product at a higher price,  I'm willing to drop to $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,900 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to close the deal at $8,750 if you're willing to meet me there.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8750.0,Bob,6,
