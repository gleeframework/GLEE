Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified.
* **Time Pressure:**  While not overly aggressive, suggesting you'll list it publicly implies there are other potential buyers, subtly pressuring Bob to act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving you room to negotiate down to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) if needed."
