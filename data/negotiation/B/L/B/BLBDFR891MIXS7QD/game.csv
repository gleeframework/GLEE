"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will more than justify the cost. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at a lower price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
