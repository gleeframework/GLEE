You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount from Alice's initial price. He knows he can always go to John for $12,000 if this negotiation fails.  This counteroffer is a bold move, but it might encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  He's still willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise.  He's still below his maximum budget, but the offer is closer to Alice's last one, indicating he's serious about buying the product.  This could push Alice to consider a deal closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, and it's only slightly higher than his last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product without exceeding his budget and avoids the risk of the negotiation collapsing."
