Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives me some room to negotiate while still getting more than my minimum of $120. I'm confident that Bob will be interested given that the product is worth $120 to him, and he has the option to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
