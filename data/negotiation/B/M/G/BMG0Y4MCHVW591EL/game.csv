"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to acknowledge your interest.  This price still allows me to receive a fair return for this valuable product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
