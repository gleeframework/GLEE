Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,010,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand my position.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has consistently moved closer to my desired price point, and at $1,010,000 the offer is too good to risk losing. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away."
