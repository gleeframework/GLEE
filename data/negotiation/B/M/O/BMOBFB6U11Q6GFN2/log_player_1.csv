"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but not so high as to scare Bob off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it. I want to see if I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate but still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $155. While it's not the highest price I hoped for, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting more likely that I'll end up selling to John for $150 if I keep rejecting offers."
