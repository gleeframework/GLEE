"Alice, your offer is way too high. Considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you putting an offer on the table. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that this product has great value for me, but I need to stay within my financial constraints. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us. I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not able to go higher than this.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your budget considerations and I'm genuinely seeking a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the significant value the product brings while acknowledging your constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can make this work.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from this deal.  I'm confident that this product has significant value for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
