"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is primarily about understanding Bob's willingness to pay and setting the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high. Considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his message aims to be collaborative, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. I'm confident that further negotiation is necessary to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you putting an offer on the table. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've decreased my price by $300,000 to show movement and willingness to negotiate. However, the new offer is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's value, aiming to shift Bob's perception and justify the higher price point.
* **Maintaining Strength:** While flexible, my message conveys that I'm firm on receiving a fair price for the product. I'm testing Bob's willingness to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that this product has great value for me, but I need to stay within my financial constraints. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us. I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not able to go higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, it's still considerably below my minimum acceptable price. His message suggests a firm budget limit, but I'm not convinced it's his final offer. I'll continue negotiating strategically to explore if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budget considerations and I'm genuinely seeking a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the significant value the product brings while acknowledging your constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can make this work."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by another $200,000, demonstrating significant movement to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** The message highlights the concept of ""mutual benefit"" and ""compromise"" to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial offer.
* **Final Offer Signal (Soft):**  While not stating it outright, this offer is getting closer to my walk-away point. The tone suggests seriousness and a desire to close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from this deal.  I'm confident that this product has significant value for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's lack of movement in his offer suggests he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to walk away from this negotiation. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss, and further rounds are unlikely to bridge the substantial gap between our valuations. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation costs."
