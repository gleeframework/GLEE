"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum asking price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a little more on this sale. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000? This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,080,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $1,120,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,120,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,120,000, which would be $1,100,000. Can we agree on that price?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
