"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning the value to Bob makes the offer seem more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on the remaining rounds and my desire to maximize profit.
* If Bob accepts, I've successfully closed the deal.
* If the negotiations become unproductive, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, his willingness to negotiate shows potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer in the next round to push for a higher price while keeping Bob engaged.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point, but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Monitoring Rounds:**  I will closely monitor the remaining rounds and assess whether selling to John for $15,000 is a better option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to achieve a fair price. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer moves towards Bob's price, but still remains above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to compromise while maintaining a fair price. 
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly hints at the possibility of selling to John, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Balancing Price and Time:**  I'll weigh the potential for a higher price with the limited remaining rounds.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob's counteroffers remain too low, I am prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting to reach a profitable deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, suggesting there might be room for a higher offer in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my target price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'll weigh the risk of continuing negotiations against the potential for a better deal versus selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000. 
* **Strategic Communication:** I'll use a  firm but polite message, emphasizing the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, and I'm willing to make one final adjustment to see if we can find a solution.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $13,000. This represents a considerable discount from my initial offer, and it's the closest I can go while still getting a fair price for this valuable product. I truly believe this is a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a significant price reduction, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while protecting my interests.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message explicitly states this is my ""final adjustment,"" putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value again to remind Bob of the benefits he will receive.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  This is a crucial round.  If Bob rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000, as the remaining rounds are limited.
* **Prepared for a Walk Away:** If the negotiations continue to stall, I am prepared to end the negotiations and sell to John to avoid a loss. 
* **Staying Flexible:**  While this is my ""final"" offer, I'll remain open to minor adjustments if Bob presents a strong case."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500? This would allow me to get the product I need while still respecting your need for a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We are down to 4 rounds left, and time is running out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While there is a chance he might budge, the risk of further negotiation is high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Exiting Negotiations:** I will politely inform Bob that I've decided to accept John's offer and end the negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed not to close a deal with Bob, selling to John is the most rational decision at this point. It ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower price or a failed deal altogether."
