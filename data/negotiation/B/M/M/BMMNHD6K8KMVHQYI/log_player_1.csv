Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:**  Using a friendly tone sets a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message implies I'm open to negotiating, but the initial price is a clear indication of what I'm hoping for. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll either negotiate further or move on to John if it seems unlikely to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I can still potentially get a better price than $80 by counteroffering.  
* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $100, so I'm not under pressure to accept a bad offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price somewhere between $80 and $100, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  Would you be willing to pay $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price ($100) and Bob's offer ($80).
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm still maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Specificity:**  I'm proposing a specific price ($90) rather than leaving it open-ended, to keep the negotiation focused. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and be prepared to either accept his offer if it's closer to my target, or to continue negotiating if he still wants a lower price. I also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for More Negotiation:** While I'd prefer $100, there's a chance Bob won't budge further.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **John's Offer:**  While I have John's offer of $100, accepting Bob's offer means a quicker sale and potentially less hassle.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $92.50.  This is a good outcome considering my initial goal of earning at least $100."
