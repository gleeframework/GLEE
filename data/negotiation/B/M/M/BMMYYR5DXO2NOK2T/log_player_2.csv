"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500
* **Your Value:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John. Even though you'd ideally get it for closer to your $12,000 value, it's still a better deal than John's price."
