"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit high, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $120? That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $120 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet at $145? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I understand $145 is as low as you want to go.  I can do $125, but that's my final offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $145. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though. How about I include a free accessory with the product if you're willing to meet me at $145?",145.0,Alice,7,
