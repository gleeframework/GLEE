Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room between your offer and Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This allows for a back and forth without immediately pushing him away.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By making a concrete offer, you're signaling to Bob that you're ready to negotiate and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is still better than selling to John, it's significantly lower than the offer you initially presented.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and can potentially reach a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, I need to make a bit more to make it worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it would be fair for me."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? That's the highest I can go, but I really like the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's close to your minimum, accepting Bob's offer for $9,800 makes sense in this scenario.  Here's why:

* **It's a good profit:**  You're still making a profit of $1,800 over your minimum, which is a good result.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  It's possible that you could counteroffer and get a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away.  You also run the risk of dropping your price too low and ending up with a smaller profit.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and you have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Taking the $9,800 now saves you time and effort."
