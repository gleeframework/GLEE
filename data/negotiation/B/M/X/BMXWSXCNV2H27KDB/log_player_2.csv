While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm also aware that I can always purchase from John if I'm unable to reach an agreement with Alice."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my maximum budget.  It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  At this point, it's best to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $800,000.
