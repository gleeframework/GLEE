# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's in your best interest to buy from John for $800,000 and save the extra money."
