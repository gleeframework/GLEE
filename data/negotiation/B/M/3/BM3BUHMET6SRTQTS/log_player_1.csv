"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. My asking price is $9,500, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $9,500 is still less than my minimum value, allowing for potential compromise without sacrificing too much.
* **Showing Openness:** By mentioning negotiation, I'm signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob, which may make him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,500 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **More rounds available:** I have 9 rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation and potentially a better offer from Bob.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** I'm confident that I can secure a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping the price from $9,500 to $9,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fair nature of my offer.
* **Focusing on a win-win:** I'm framing the deal as mutually beneficial, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $8,750 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **More rounds available:**  I still have 6 rounds left, which provides room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,250? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement, and I believe you'll find the product's value worth this price. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway again:** I'm continuing to compromise by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows persistence and a desire to find common ground.
* **Reframing the offer:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price and highlighting the value of the product. This might persuade Bob to see it as a good investment.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value, indicating that I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited rounds left:** While I only have 4 rounds left, I'm confident I can secure a better deal if I keep negotiating.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, so there's a possibility he'll come closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If I don't reach a suitable agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,900 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,100 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can agree on this, we both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm making a final attempt to meet Bob halfway by offering a price only $100 below my previous offer. This shows a strong commitment to closing the deal while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm reiterating the fairness of the price in relation to the product's value. This could persuade Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm hinting at finality to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have 3 rounds left.
* I'll closely analyze Bob's counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If no satisfactory agreement is reached, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,900 and $9,100, which is $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,000 is still slightly below my desired price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited rounds left:**  I only have 2 rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further.
* **Potential for a better deal is low:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but his offers haven't significantly increased. It's unlikely that I'll get a much better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower profit.
* **Securing a deal is important:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and allows me to avoid the risk of not securing a deal in the remaining rounds.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can close the deal and earn a respectable profit, even if it's not my ideal price. The potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower price outweighs the slight difference in profit."
