"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a very worthwhile investment. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather see this go to someone who can truly maximize its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
