"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,075,000.  Would that be feasible?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go down to $1,087,500. This offers a good deal for both of us and allows us to close this transaction.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
