"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. Based on our previous discussion, I propose we meet somewhere between our initial offers. How about $9,250 for the product?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,250 is getting closer, but I'm still a little too high.  How about we split the difference and agree on $9,125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9125.0,Bob,4,
