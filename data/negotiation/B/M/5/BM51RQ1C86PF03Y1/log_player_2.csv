"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $12,000 to us, but we're willing to negotiate. Considering its value to you, how about we start at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is slightly above your max price.**  You want to pay less than $10,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to push for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** You have a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. Based on our previous discussion, I propose we meet somewhere between our initial offers. How about $9,250 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still above your target.**  $9,250 is better than her first offer, but you're still aiming for under $10,000. 
* **You have room for one or two more rounds.**  Continuing to negotiate could get you closer to your ideal price.
* **Buying from John is still a good backup.**  If the negotiation falls apart, you have a safe option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,250 is getting closer, but I'm still a little too high.  How about we split the difference and agree on $9,125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9125}
