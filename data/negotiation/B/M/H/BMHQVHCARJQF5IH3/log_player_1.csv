Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter-offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price point, and it's  above my minimum value.  While I could try to push for a higher price, I risk him backing out completely and leaving me with only John's lower offer. It's better to secure the sale at a decent price than to risk losing the deal entirely."
