"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to get a better deal. $105 is too close to our fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and make it $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $102.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is clearly not going to budge much more. It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly better than $102.50, and at this point, the difference isn't worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $100 guarantees us the best possible price."
