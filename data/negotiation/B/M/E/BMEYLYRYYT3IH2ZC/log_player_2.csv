"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100 and John's offer of $100.  It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($70) allows room for negotiation. It's a common tactic in bargaining to start low and work your way up. This approach aims to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price while staying well below your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to your budget, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $100.  There's room for further negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $90? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between your previous offer ($70) and Alice's current offer ($110). 
* **Staying below John's price:** It's important to remain below John's offer of $100 to make the negotiation with Alice worthwhile.
* **Testing the waters:** Offering $90 gauges Alice's willingness to go lower while still providing some room for a potential final compromise."
