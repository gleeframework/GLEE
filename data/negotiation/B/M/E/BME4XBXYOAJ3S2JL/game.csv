"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  There's clearly value in this product for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
