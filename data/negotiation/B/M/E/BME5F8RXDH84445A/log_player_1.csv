"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start high in a negotiation.  This gives us room to maneuver down if necessary. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $1,500,000 is a significant markup from our minimum value, but it's not unrealistic, especially if the product has potential for high value to Bob.
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes our belief in the product's value and invites Bob to share his thoughts. This creates a more collaborative tone and can lead to a smoother negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. While I appreciate its uniqueness, my budget allows me to pay up to $1400000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  While $1,400,000 is close to our minimum, we have 8 rounds left and the potential to get closer to our desired price. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, we show him that we're not desperate to sell and that we believe the product is worth more. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** We can use the next round to counter with a number slightly lower than our initial offer, showing flexibility while still trying to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,450,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're showing a willingness to negotiate by dropping our price slightly from the initial offer.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than our minimum, demonstrating our belief in the product's worth.
* **Frame it Positively:**  We're emphasizing the benefit of reaching a deal (""allows me to move forward"") and framing it as a ""fair compromise"" to make the counteroffer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I'd like to propose a price of $1425000. I hope this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  While $1,425,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we're still within a reasonable range to potentially get a better price. 
* **Strategic Delay:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to continue the negotiation and see if we can push for a higher price. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  There are still 6 rounds left. It's possible that by continuing to negotiate, we might be able to reach an agreement closer to our desired $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,437,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1437500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** We're proposing a price exactly in the middle of our previous offer and Bob's latest offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reinforce Value:**  We remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize why we're holding firm on our price.
* **Focus on Shared Benefit:**  We frame our counteroffer as a win-win situation (""benefits us both""), making it more appealing and encouraging a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm willing to consider $1430000 as a fair price for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,430,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,430,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Bob's offer is only $7,500 lower than our last counteroffer, and we are nearing our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming more risky to continue negotiating. 
* **Securing a Profit:**  $1,430,000 is a significant profit, and we don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice, as it allows us to secure a good price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
