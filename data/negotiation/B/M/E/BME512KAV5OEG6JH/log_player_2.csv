"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $140.  It's worth rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we settle at $130?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $128. It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both agree to that."", ""product_price"": 128}
