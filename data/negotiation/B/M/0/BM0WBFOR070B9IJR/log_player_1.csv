"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go to $11,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

At this point, Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 less than John's guaranteed offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely.
