"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering my budget. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 was a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $135. It's a great compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go as high as $130.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're willing to commit to buying at $135, I'm willing to make a deal. If not, I'm open to continuing the negotiation.",135.0,Alice,5,
