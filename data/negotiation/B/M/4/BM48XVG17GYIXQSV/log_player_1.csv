"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also trying to build rapport by being positive and highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit. "", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a compromise, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range while still being reasonable for Bob.  I'm also reiterating my willingness to negotiate to show I'm flexible."
