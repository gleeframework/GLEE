Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation Isn't Realistic:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's true maximum valuation. This offer starts high to test Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $19,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely you'll end up with a price closer to your desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, creating a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Worst case scenario, you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob."
