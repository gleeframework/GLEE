Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $1,325,000 is still a good deal for me and secures the sale. It's important to consider that continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or the deal falling apart completely."
