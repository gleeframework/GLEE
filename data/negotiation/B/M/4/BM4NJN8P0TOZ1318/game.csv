"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really close to my limit, but I can offer $100.  If you're willing to go that low, I'm happy to buy it.  If not, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
