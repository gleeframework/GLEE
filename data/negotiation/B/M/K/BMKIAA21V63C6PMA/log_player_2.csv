"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can potentially get the product for a lower price. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer starts at $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for Alice to come down a bit without losing too much. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights that I recognize the product's value but emphasizes that I need a lower price to make it work for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that's fair for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction by lowering her price, $925,000 is still above my target.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000. There's still room for both of us to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value to me and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer moves me closer to Alice's offer while staying within my acceptable range.  It shows that I'm serious about finding a solution.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** The message stresses that this is a fair compromise, acknowledging both my needs and Alice's. 
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing a desire to reach a final agreement."
