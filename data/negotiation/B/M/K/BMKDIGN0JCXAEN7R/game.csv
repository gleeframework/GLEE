"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is far above my budget.  Given my maximum budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering your desired selling price and my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is considerably below its true market value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and the long-term benefits it offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  To make this work, I can offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a fair price considering both our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
