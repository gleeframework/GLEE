"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open, signaling that I am willing to negotiate.

By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept a higher price than expected.
2. **Gain Negotiation Leverage:**  Starting high gives me more room to make concessions later, which can foster goodwill and make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is far above my budget.  Given my maximum budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering your desired selling price and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is considerably below its true market value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and the long-term benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still considerably above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reiterates the product's value and benefits, subtly justifying the still-high price. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  The tone remains confident and firm, conveying that I'm seeking a fair deal that recognizes the product's worth.

By making a significant concession, I hope to:

1. **Encourage Bob's Engagement:**  The price reduction might signal that a mutually agreeable solution is possible, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
2. **Leave Room for Further Negotiation:** The new price leaves space for further concessions from both sides, increasing the chances of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  To make this work, I can offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a fair price considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount in further rounds, the difference is relatively small, and there's a risk that Bob might withdraw from the negotiation or that further back-and-forth could sour the deal. 

Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
