"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a real game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While the product might be ""amazing"", Alice's initial offer of $90 is above Bob's maximum price point of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $82.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as close to his $80 limit as possible. While Alice's offer of $82.50 is closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $82.50 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's my absolute limit, but I'm really interested in the product."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's unique features. How about $79.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $79.50 is very close to Bob's absolute limit of $80. While Bob could technically still try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $80 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price, just slightly above his maximum."
