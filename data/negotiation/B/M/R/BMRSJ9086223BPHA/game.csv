"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1600000 is a bit lower than my initial expectation, I'm willing to come down to $1800000.  This price still allows me to achieve a profitable outcome, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1800000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1700000.
