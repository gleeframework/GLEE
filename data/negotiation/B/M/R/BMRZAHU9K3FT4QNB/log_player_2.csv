"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's value:** $100
* **Alice's value:** $80
* **Alice's offer:** $95 

Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He has room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to $80.  Buying from John for $100 is a less favorable option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's value:** $100
* **Alice's value:** $80
* **Alice's offer:** $90

While $90 is better than $95, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price. He has room to go lower than $90, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. Buying from John is still a less favorable option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's value:** $100
* **Alice's value:** $80
* **Alice's offer:** $92

At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's getting close to her likely minimum value.  Rejecting and counteroffering again risks Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting the $92 offer is the best option here, as it's a good price within Bob's budget and saves money compared to buying from John."
