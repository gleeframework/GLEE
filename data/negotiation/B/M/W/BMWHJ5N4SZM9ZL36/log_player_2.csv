"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is a bit high. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $100, so it's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from her offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $105 is still closer to her initial offer than mine.  I believe I can get her closer to $100, especially with several rounds left in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $98?  That's a fair price that works for me."",
""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

This counteroffer inches closer to Alice's last offer while still aiming for a price below $100. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but want a price that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $98, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'll meet you at $102. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably, and $102 is a reasonable price. It's a good balance between getting a deal and not dragging out the negotiation further, especially considering John's offer is $120."
