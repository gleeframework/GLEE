"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility for a counter-offer from Alice closer to your acceptable range, or you can proceed with the guaranteed purchase from John at a much lower price."
