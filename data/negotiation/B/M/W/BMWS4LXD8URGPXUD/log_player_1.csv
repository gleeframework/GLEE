{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value I'm offering is very competitive. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high starting offer, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. It also emphasizes the unique value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I will counteroffer to see if I can secure a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum for this product.  Considering its unique value, I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I would like to propose an alternative at $875000. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value and a better offer than selling to John. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price I can reasonably accept."
