"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $14,000 is still a significant premium.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, giving you room to counteroffer and try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  This gives you leverage if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential value of this product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about negotiating but leaves room for compromise.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties, setting a collaborative tone.
* **Sets the stage for future rounds:**  By rejecting the initial offer and proposing a lower price, you've established a negotiating framework."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While she's come down, $13,000 is still outside my comfort zone, especially with a backup option of buying from John.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to bargain. I can counteroffer again and potentially get a better price.
* **No urgency to accept:** With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $12,500. It's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  Instead of making another large jump, a $500 increase shows you're willing to compromise but still trying to get the best deal.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  ""Fair compromise"" and ""good price for both of us"" reinforces a collaborative approach.
* **Maintain leverage:** By sticking to your position, you keep pressure on Alice to come down further."
