"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to try to get the price closer to my target of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation.  The risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially leading to a higher price outweighs the potential for a slight discount."
