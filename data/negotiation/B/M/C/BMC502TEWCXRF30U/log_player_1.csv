Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I'm going to start by asking for the full amount. This is my best possible outcome, and if Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob rather than John, I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still above Bob's valuation, but a significant decrease from my initial offer. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still being close enough to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still too low for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more to try and get a deal with Bob, but I won't go below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my last counteroffer.  It's still above his valuation but closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his last offer is still below my minimum price. I've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price. I'm going to sell to John to guarantee my minimum value."
