"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to achieve a significant portion of my desired value. I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This would be a significant saving for me while still allowing you to profit considerably.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value you've indicated the product holds for you, while still allowing me to cover a substantial portion of my desired value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
