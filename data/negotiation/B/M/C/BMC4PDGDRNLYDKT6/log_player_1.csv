"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

**Note:** I'm not going straight for my $15,000 floor price as I want to explore the possibility of a higher deal with Bob. However, I'm keeping the offer within the range of what I consider acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Floor:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal target.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for me to push for a higher price. I believe I can secure a better deal with a counteroffer.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:**  There's always a chance that Bob might be willing to go a bit higher if I'm persistent.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it gives you a significant saving. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and emphasize the ""saving"" Bob would be getting.
* **Positive Language:** Using ""fair"" and ""significant saving"" keeps the tone positive and encourages Bob to accept.

**Note:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll reassess the situation based on how many rounds are left and how confident I am in securing a better deal. I might consider lowering the price again or cutting my losses and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my $13,500 floor price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** This back-and-forth is starting to get tiresome, and I'm not sure Bob is going to budge much more.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're only on round 4, but I have to be mindful of the limited number of rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to counteroffer with a slightly lower price, but I'm going to make it clear that this is my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll likely cut my losses and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $13,200 is still a bit too low for me. This is my final offer: $13,400.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it lets us close this quickly.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 13400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a clear boundary and making it clear this is my last offer. 
* **Slightly Lower:** I've dropped the price slightly to show flexibility, but it's still above my floor price and gives me a good profit.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the need for a quick decision to put pressure on Bob.
* **Alternative Options:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other buyers, making him realize he might lose out if he doesn't accept. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John. I've made a reasonable effort to negotiate with Bob, but his offers are too low for me at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make this work, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,300 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already on round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly inefficient.
* **Minimal Gain:** Bob's offer is only $100 higher than his previous offer, which is a negligible gain for me, especially considering the time spent negotiating.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a secure option that eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offers have consistently fallen short of my desired price.  With limited time remaining, it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed profit with John and move on."
