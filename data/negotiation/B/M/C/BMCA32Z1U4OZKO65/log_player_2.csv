"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than the $15,000 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still leaves you with a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering $13,500.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
