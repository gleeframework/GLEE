Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still leaves you with a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
