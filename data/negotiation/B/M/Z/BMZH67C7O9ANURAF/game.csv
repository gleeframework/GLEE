"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $100. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm sure you'll find it a good value.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $87.50 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  How about we meet in the middle at $89? This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $89. I'm willing to go up to $86. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",86.0,Bob,8,
