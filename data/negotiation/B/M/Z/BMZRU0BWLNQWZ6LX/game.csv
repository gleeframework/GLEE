"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
