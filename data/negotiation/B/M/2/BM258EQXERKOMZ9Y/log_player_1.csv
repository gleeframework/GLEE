{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm setting the price high, but not too high, to see if Bob is interested.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'll reject his offer and try to push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $77.50 is still just below my bottom line. Let's split the difference and go with $80.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
