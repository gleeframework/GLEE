"Thanks for the offer, Bob, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $77.50?,77.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $77.50 is still just below my bottom line. Let's split the difference and go with $80.  It's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
