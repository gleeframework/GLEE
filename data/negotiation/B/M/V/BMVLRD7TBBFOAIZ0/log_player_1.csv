Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's significantly lower than my desired price point. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value in the next few rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $800,000 is too far below the product's value. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your needs and the product's worth. Let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
