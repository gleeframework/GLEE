"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $900,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to invest in the product, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $700,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $850,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much further:**  She's made it clear she values the product highly. While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant drop from $850,000.
* **John offers a guaranteed price:**  Why risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more than $800,000 when John offers a guaranteed price that meets your budget?

While you might be able to squeeze a slightly better deal out of Alice, the potential savings are not worth the risk of her refusing and the deal falling through."
