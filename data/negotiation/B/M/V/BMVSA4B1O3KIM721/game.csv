"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This price reflects its exceptional quality and the potential it holds for you. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, I believe a price closer to $1,350,000 would be a fair reflection of the product's value to you.  Remember, it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and this offer still provides you with a significant advantage.  I'm confident this price will allow us to both come away satisfied with the transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about buying from John, though...",1300000.0,Bob,4,
