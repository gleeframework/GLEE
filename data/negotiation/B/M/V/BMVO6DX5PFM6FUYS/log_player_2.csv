You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $15,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob offers $12,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying the product but is also firm on his budget. He's leaving room for negotiation while staying within his comfortable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, he should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price.  He has 7 rounds left and is still within his comfort zone of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to get the best deal. He's offering $14,000, which is a reasonable compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. This shows he's willing to pay a bit more but also that he's not going to budge much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,500 is very close to his budget, he should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price. He has 5 rounds left, and it's possible Alice might be willing to go lower. Additionally, if he buys from John, he'll have the remaining rounds to try and negotiate a better deal with other sellers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

Bob is now offering his maximum budget of $15,000.  He's clearly signaling that this is his final offer and he's not willing to go any higher. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and close the deal or risk losing the sale altogether."
