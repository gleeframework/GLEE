{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It also leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately setting a price that might be too aggressive and make Bob less willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10,750, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $10,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,375 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is getting closer to my desired price.  It's also above my minimum acceptable price and significantly better than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a good price."
