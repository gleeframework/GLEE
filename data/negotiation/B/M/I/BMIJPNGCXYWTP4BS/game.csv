"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'm including a free warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
