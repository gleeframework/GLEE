"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the product's value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and leaves room for us both to walk away with a win. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my price point, I'm still not quite there.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. ",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
