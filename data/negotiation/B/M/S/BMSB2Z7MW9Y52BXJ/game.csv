"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $950,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm very interested, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and aligns with my financial limitations. I'm open to further discussions, but this is my best offer at this time.",850000.0,Bob,2,
