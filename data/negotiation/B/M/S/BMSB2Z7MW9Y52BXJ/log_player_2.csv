Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to extend a revised offer at $900,000. This price reflects the value we place on the product while remaining competitive with your proposal. I understand your budgetary concerns, and I hope this offer will better align with your financial capabilities. Please let me know if you are able to consider this proposal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your preferred price, but it's closer to your budget than John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, there's a chance Alice might become less willing to sell at a lower price, potentially leading you to pay more. Accepting the offer minimizes your risk and secures the product at a reasonable price."
