"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. This is a fantastic opportunity to own a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating that you are serious about negotiating. However, it's still within a range that might be considered reasonable for a valuable product. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your counteroffer (budget and market value) makes you appear more credible and less likely to be seen as simply trying to lowball Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** There's still room to negotiate upwards if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1300000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  The pressure is starting to build as I have fewer rounds to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,700,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer shows you are serious about buying but are not willing to go higher.  
* **Final Offer:** Stating it's your ""final offer"" adds pressure and makes it more likely Alice will consider it seriously.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning other options (John) adds credibility to your stance and makes it more likely Alice will accept. 
* **Fair Price:**  $1,500,000 is your maximum, and it's a reasonable price that should be tempting to Alice if she's willing to negotiate."
