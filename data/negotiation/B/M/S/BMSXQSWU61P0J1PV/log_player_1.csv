Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to own a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit. However, I'm also mindful that this is a negotiation and I might need to adjust my price based on Bob's response. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1700000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1500000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I can get a better price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the sale at this point."
