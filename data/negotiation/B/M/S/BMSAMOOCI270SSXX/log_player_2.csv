The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer of $90 is too high. I will reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

I'm offering $75 for the product. This is a reasonable price, considering it's worth $80 to me and $80 to Alice.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."

While $87 is closer to my target, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.  This is also the price John is willing to sell the product for.  I hope Alice will accept, but I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
