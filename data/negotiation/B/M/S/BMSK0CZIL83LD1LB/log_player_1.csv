Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a deal that's profitable for you.
* **Not Too High:** While I want to maximize profit,  a price too far above Bob's perceived value ($15,000) could make him immediately walk away. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the asking price, without explicitly stating it's worth more than Bob's valuation. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a deal with Bob, avoiding the need to sell to John at my minimum price."
