"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a drastic reduction in the first round.  I'll counteroffer to maintain my leverage and see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least recoup my minimum value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This gives you a good price while ensuring I get fair value for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000 again? I'm willing to take a slightly lower price, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but his offers are still significantly lower than my desired price. I've been willing to compromise, but I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.

With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and missing out on a potential higher offer is high.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and secures a sale."
