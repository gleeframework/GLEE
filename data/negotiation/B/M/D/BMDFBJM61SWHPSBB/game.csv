"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least recoup my minimum value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This gives you a good price while ensuring I get fair value for the product.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000 again? I'm willing to take a slightly lower price, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
