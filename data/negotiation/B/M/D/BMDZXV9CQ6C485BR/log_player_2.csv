"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to get at least $12,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unwilling to sell for less than $12,000, which is over your budget. You can get the product for a better price from John."
