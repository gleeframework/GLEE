""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you and this price reflects its worth while leaving room for a profit on your end."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure the Sale:**  Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of him accepting, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
