"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price, but it's still within your budget. However, you have the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After re-evaluating the market value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your counteroffer, and it's still within your budget.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer and the time it takes to negotiate further isn't worth the potential saving of $100,000.  It's better to secure the product at this price rather than risk losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
