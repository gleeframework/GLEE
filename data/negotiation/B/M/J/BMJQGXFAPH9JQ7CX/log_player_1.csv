{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $100 and gives Bob some room to negotiate. It's also below his perceived value of $150, so there's potential for a win-win situation.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than selling to John for $100, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my desired $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $120? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
