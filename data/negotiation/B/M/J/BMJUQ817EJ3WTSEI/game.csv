"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $130? This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal.  Let's make this happen!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's close this now.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $115.  It's closer, but I need to make a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal!",125.0,Alice,5,
