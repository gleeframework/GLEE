Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:**  A high starting price provides room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value"" of the product subtly hints at its worth, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

**Important Note:**  While aiming high is good, being too aggressive might make Bob lose interest.  This offer balances ambition with a degree of reasonableness."
