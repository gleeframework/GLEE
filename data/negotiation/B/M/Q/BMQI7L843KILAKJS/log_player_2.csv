"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value to you, we're offering it at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a unique chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than her product valuation ($12,000), it's still lower than your maximum budget ($15,000) and the alternative offer from John. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
