Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 if Bob refuses.

Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to make a small ""profit"" compared to his perceived value while maximizing my potential earnings. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed a good sale with John."
