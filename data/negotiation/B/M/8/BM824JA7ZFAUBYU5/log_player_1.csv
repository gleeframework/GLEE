I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. There are still rounds left, so I'm not going to settle yet."
