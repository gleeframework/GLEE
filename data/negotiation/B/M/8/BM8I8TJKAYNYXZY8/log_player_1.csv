"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and allows for some potential profit while still being significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than my minimum threshold of $80, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  Bob is clearly motivated to buy, and I believe I can secure a higher price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Bob seems determined to buy, and with only 6 rounds left, I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise that shows flexibility while still keeping my profit margin above my minimum threshold.  I believe this price is fair and likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, with only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision. While $85 isn't ideal, it's above my minimum threshold and I'm unsure if I can secure a better offer from Bob. It's also a significant improvement over John's offer.  Accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit in this scenario."
