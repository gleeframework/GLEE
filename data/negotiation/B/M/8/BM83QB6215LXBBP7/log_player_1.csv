Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $11,000.  This is a bit of a gamble, as Bob might immediately reject it. However, I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations drag on too long or Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll be prepared to accept an offer closer to $10,000, but I won't go below that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise - halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $9,500. This is still below my minimum value of $10,000, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's close to my minimum and selling to John would only net me $500 more.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or no sale at all is not worth the potential $500 gain."
