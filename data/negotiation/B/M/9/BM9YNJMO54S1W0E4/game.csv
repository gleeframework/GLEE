"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential benefits for you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $18,000, considering the product's worth is $10,000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $12,000 is significantly below my initial valuation.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $15,000 is the best price. I'm willing to pay $13,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's make this happen. If you're willing to meet me at $14,250, we have a deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $14,250 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
