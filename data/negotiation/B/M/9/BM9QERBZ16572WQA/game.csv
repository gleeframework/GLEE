"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14500, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
