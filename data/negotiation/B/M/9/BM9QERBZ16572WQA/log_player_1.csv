{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price ($20,000) that leaves room for negotiation.  It also focuses on the value of the product for Bob to pique his interest. This strategy allows for a good chance of a successful negotiation while also securing a profit well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is there any wiggle room in your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired profit margin. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a more acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum price, but it's still a bit lower than you would like.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14500, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price.  While it is tempting to continue negotiating, I don't want to risk going below my minimum and losing out on a better offer.  Selling to John ensures I get a fair price."
