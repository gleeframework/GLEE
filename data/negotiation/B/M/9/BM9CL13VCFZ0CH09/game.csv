"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my range at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my limit. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
