"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $900,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
