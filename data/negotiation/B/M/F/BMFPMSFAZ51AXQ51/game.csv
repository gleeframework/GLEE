"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
