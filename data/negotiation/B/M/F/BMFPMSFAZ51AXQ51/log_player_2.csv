Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice."
