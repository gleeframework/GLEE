Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below what I would get from John. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems Bob is unwilling to go higher. I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum, so I'll sell the product to John for $150 to guarantee a fair price."
