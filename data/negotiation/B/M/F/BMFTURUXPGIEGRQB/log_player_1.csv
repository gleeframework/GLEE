"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a rare opportunity, and I believe this price accurately reflects the asset's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's desirability.

We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is closer to our desired range, we still have room to negotiate. It's too early to settle, especially since we have the option to sell to John for our minimum acceptable price.  We'll aim to guide the negotiation closer to $1,800,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your perspective, and while I recognize your valuation,  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,850,000. This product has generated significant interest, and I'm confident in its ability to deliver exceptional value. I believe this adjusted price reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We've made a significant concession by dropping $50,000 from our initial price, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** We're still anchoring the product's value at a high level by mentioning ""significant interest"" to maintain a sense of desirability.
* **Target Price:** We're aiming for a price point that maximizes our potential profit while leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has met us halfway between our last two offers, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Strong Profit Margin:** $1,750,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's also the risk that Bob walks away. This offer represents a good balance of risk and reward."
