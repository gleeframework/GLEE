"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start the negotiation with this offer!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is more than the guaranteed $800,000 from John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident that he values the product enough to pay closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value you've expressed for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce my price to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a good middle ground that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is tempting, it's still below my initial desired price.  I believe Bob has some room for a higher offer, especially considering he values the product at $1,000,000.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $875,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $890,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
