"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while setting a firm anchor. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential"" and ""value"" of the product helps justify the high initial price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer gives ample room for Bob to counter, allowing us to gauge his interest and flexibility. 

It's important to remember that negotiation is about finding a mutually agreeable price. This opening offer sets the stage for that process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer attempts to find a middle ground, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  I'll counter in the next round to try and steer the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a more agreeable middle ground. I propose a price of $1,850,000."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Countering:** I want to acknowledge Bob's attempt at compromise while firmly reiterating that his offer is too low. 
* **Significant Movement:**  While I'm lowering my asking price considerably, it's still far above both Bob's offer and his perceived value. This signals a willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position.
* **Justification:** I'm omitting any mention of my minimum acceptable price to avoid anchoring the negotiation too low. The focus remains on the product's inherent value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is a fair price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a price of $1,275,000. This is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to a pattern of halving the difference between our positions, but we are still far apart. He's also explicitly referencing my minimum acceptable price, which weakens my negotiating position. While it's tempting to accept to avoid a complete impasse, I'll counter again, but be prepared to walk away soon if progress isn't made."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but simply splitting the difference isn't going to work here.  The value of this product goes beyond simple math. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal. I propose a price of $1,600,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** I'm making it clear that simply averaging our positions isn't a viable negotiation strategy. This emphasizes the value beyond Bob's perception.
* **Concession with a Limit:** This offer represents a substantial concession on my part, moving closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, the ""final offer"" statement sets a firm boundary.
* **Time Pressure:**  By implying scarcity and a limited window of opportunity, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to act quickly and accept a price closer to my target. 

This approach balances firmness with a final concession. It aims to either secure a reasonable deal with Bob or prompt me to walk away and pursue the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more move to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has countered with his own ""final offer,"" which is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  

* **Limited Potential for Movement:** Bob's negotiation tactics suggest he's aiming for a price closer to his initial offer, which is too low for me to consider.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, fulfilling my minimum acceptable price. It eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob failing.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the opportunity cost of potentially delaying the sale. A quick and assured sale to John is more efficient. 

While there's a chance Bob might reconsider, the risk of losing John's offer and the small likelihood of reaching a significantly better agreement with Bob makes selling to John the most logical choice at this point."
