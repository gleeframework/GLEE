"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a more agreeable middle ground. I propose a price of $1,850,000.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is a fair price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a price of $1,275,000. This is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but simply splitting the difference isn't going to work here.  The value of this product goes beyond simple math. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal. I propose a price of $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more move to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
