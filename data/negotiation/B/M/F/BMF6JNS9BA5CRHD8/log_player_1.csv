"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your budget constraints, the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price range, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice."
