"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
