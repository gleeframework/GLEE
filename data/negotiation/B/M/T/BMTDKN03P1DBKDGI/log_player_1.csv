Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still above my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is pretty close to my counteroffer of $140. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's still a good deal for me.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and avoid further negotiation."
