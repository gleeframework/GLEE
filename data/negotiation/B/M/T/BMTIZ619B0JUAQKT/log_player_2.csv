{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're looking to save money and $180 is more than your maximum.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a lower price than what I'm willing to pay from John, but I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is closer to my limit, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives me another chance to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is just above my limit, but it's still a better deal than buying from John. It's also likely that Alice will not go lower, as she's already shown she's willing to negotiate. I'm taking this offer to secure the product."
