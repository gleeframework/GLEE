Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,400,000 is below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the value of the product, but also willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to secure a higher price while leaving room for counteroffers, potentially leading to a final price closer to Bob's maximum. Remember, you can always accept John's offer of $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still below the initial offer you made.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to your target price of $1,400,000. You have room to counteroffer without immediately resorting to John's offer of $1,200,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* You will need to craft a counteroffer to Bob. 
* Consider a counteroffer slightly lower than your initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $1,350,000. This shows you're willing to compromise but still value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand it's a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go lower than $1,350,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting dangerously close to John's offer of $1,200,000. While continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price, the risk of further rejection and a potential deadlock is high.

**Choosing to sell to John ensures a guaranteed sale at a price that meets your minimum requirement.**  The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
