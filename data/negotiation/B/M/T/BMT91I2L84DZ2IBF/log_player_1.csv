Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and it's also significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer, and it makes it more likely that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
