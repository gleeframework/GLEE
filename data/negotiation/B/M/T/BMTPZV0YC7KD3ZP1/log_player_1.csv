Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Knowing it's worth a significant amount to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a fair deal considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Time Value and Certainty:**  While I have a backup offer from John, selling to Bob quickly at a slightly lower price might be preferable to potential delays. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product he values, and I maximize my profit beyond the guaranteed $800,000."
