"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, I'm still a ways off from that price point.  Could you do $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  This is a fair compromise that gives us both some wiggle room.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
