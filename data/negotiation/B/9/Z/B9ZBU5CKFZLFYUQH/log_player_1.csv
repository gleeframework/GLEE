"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be great for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, but not too far off from what I know the product is worth to me.  This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's important to remember that I can still sell to John for $150, so I'm not in a desperate position to accept this offer.  Rejecting it allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith and willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, I'm still a ways off from that price point.  Could you do $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a hurry to sell, especially since I can always sell to John for $150.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  This is a fair compromise that gives us both some wiggle room.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  $100 is a good middle ground that's closer to Bob's offer but still ensures I get a decent return on the product."
