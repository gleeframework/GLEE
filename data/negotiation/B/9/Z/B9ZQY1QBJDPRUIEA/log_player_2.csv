"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice.  She's offering the product at your maximum price.  Buying from John is the same price and avoids the uncertainty of negotiation."
