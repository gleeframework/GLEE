You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that amount, there's no room for negotiation to save money. It's best to take the guaranteed option and buy from John."
