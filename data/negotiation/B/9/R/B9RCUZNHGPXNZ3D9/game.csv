"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
