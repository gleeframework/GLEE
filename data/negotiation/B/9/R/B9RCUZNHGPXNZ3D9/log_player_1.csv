Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price down, but you still have a safety net with John's offer.
* **It's assertive:**  It establishes your desired price point and signals that you are serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept as it's better than nothing, rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  A good counteroffer would be slightly lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair compromise:**  This offer is a midpoint between your previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,250,000).
* **Maintain leverage:** It's still higher than Bob's offer, which means you still have leverage to negotiate.
* **Clear communication:** You are showing flexibility and willingness to work with Bob while reaffirming your minimum acceptable price."
