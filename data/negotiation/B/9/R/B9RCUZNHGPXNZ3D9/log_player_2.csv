# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially negotiate a lower price, it's likely that Alice will not go lower than $1,350,000.  Buying from Alice at this price is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000."
