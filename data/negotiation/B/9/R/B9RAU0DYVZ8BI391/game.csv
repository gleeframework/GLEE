"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $775,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 still feels a bit low.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $812,500.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase at this price. Can we meet on this?",795000.0,Bob,6,
