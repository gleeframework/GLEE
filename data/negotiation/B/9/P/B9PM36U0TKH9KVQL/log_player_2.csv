"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's initial offer, so it's worth negotiating. There's no point in buying from John right away, as Alice's offer is already lower than his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see how much she's willing to budge.  I'm still within my budget, and there's a good chance she'll counter with a price closer to my offer than her initial one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, it's still lower than John's price and within my budget. There's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still below Alice's most recent offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's favorable to me.  I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a reasonable offer and be more inclined to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is increasing, but it's still within my budget and lower than John's price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet willing to settle for this price. I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her last offer. This is a significant increase from my previous counteroffer, showing that I am willing to compromise.  I'm hoping that this will be a more appealing offer for Alice, and we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a higher price than I'm comfortable with.  Although I'm running out of rounds, I'm going to reject and try one more counteroffer. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still below Alice's current price. I'm hoping that with only two rounds left, Alice will be more inclined to accept a deal closer to my price than risk losing the sale entirely. If she rejects, I'll have to make the tough decision of either accepting her final offer in Round 10 or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out for a higher price.  While this offer is within my budget, it's very close to John's price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Alice to budge just a little more in the final round.  If she doesn't, I'll have to decide whether to buy from her or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,400,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer to $1,400,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Alice's last offer, but still within my budget.  With only one round remaining, I'm hoping this is a compelling enough offer for Alice to accept. 

If Alice rejects, I will be forced to accept her final offer or buy from John. While I prefer to buy from Alice if possible, I'm not willing to pay more than $1,400,000."
