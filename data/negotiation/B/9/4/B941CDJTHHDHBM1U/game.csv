"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
