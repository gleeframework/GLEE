This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation.  It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still in a good negotiating position.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my initial price, aiming for a final price closer to $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $950,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a revised offer of $920000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

$920,000 is still a very good price, considering my minimum is $800,000.  It's time to close the deal and secure a profitable sale."
