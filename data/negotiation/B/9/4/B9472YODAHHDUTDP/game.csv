"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
