"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $18000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $22000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $20500?",20500.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $20000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",20000.0,Bob,8,,

"I understand you're getting frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $21000. I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $20000 and $21000, which is $20500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",20500.0,Alice,9,,
