Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. If the negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm hoping for more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will give me a chance to negotiate and potentially earn more than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. It's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, giving him room to negotiate but also showing that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a decent compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
