"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's inherent value and potential are far greater than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000.  This price point represents a significant investment on your part but one that I believe will yield substantial returns for you in the long run.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $975,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects a price that I believe is fair for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product. This offer reflects my desire to see this deal through while ensuring a fair return on a product I know will be valuable to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $950,000 is still a bit high. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This represents a solid compromise and allows for a successful transaction for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
