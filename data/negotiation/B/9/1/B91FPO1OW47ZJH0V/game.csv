"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $8000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution!",14000.0,Alice,3,
