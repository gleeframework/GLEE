"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,500 is significantly below its value.  I could consider $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I see your point, but the $7,500 offer is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. To be honest, $10,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  I have another buyer interested at that price, but I think this product would be a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

At this point, Alice has made it clear she won't go below $10,000.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut off negotiations and buy from John."
