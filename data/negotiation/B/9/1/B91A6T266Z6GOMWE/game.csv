"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $6,500 for it.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,500 is significantly below its value.  I could consider $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I see your point, but the $7,500 offer is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. To be honest, $10,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  I have another buyer interested at that price, but I think this product would be a great fit for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
