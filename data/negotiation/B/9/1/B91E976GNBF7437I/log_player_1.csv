Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, starting higher allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price as a reflection of the product's value, not just an arbitrary number.
* **Alternative buyer:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed backup buyer at our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) gives us leverage. We don't *need* to go below that. 

**Important Note:** This is a single, opening offer.  Depending on Bob's reaction and negotiation style, we might adjust our approach in subsequent messages."
