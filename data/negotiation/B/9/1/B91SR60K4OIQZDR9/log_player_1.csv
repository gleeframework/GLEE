Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the value I want for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, Bob's offer is now only $25,000 below my previous counteroffer. This is a good compromise, and further negotiation might take too much time.  It's also worth noting that John is only willing to pay $800,000, making Bob's offer the better option."
