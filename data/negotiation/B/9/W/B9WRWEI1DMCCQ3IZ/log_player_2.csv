"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a significant difference between her offer and her minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me right now. Considering its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response and your understanding of the product's inherent value.  While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a higher investment. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This price acknowledges your interest while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,300,000 to $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer a lower price, this offer is still within my budget and significantly better than buying from John. Accepting the offer allows me to acquire the product at a price that saves me $300,000 compared to John."
