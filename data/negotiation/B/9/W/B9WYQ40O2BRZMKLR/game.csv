"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a considerable amount to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $2000000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm capped at $800000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me, and it's within a range that might work for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $900000 - this is closer to my maximum and hopefully a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
