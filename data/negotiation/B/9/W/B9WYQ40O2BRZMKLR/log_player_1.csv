Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm capped at $800000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me, and it's within a range that might work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
