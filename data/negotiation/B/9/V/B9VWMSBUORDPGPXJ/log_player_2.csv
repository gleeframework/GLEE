# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started: $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice, but you can always fall back on buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in exploring this further. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,400,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise: $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as you might be able to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than my target price.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1300000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession: $1320000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $1,320,000 is still more expensive than what John is offering.  Since you can get the same product for a lower price, it's in your best interest to finalize the deal with John and save the extra $120,000."
