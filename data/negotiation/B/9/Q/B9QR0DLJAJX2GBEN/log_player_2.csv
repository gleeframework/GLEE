"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for both of us to profit. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to her lowest acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This matches the price John is offering.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice as it's unlikely she'll go any lower."
