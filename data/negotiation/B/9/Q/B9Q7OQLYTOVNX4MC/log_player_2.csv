"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but Bob can likely get a better price.  Since Bob's maximum is $12,000, there's room to negotiate and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product at this price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $200 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price."
