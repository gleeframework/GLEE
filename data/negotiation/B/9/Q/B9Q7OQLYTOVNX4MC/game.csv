"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product at this price. Let me know what you think!",10800.0,Alice,3,
