"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($10,000) is still above your maximum valuation ($12,000).** 
* **You have a fallback option:** You can buy the product from John for $12,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with buying from John at your maximum budget."
