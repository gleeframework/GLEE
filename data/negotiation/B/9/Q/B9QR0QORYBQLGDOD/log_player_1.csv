"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $150. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to consider the deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to leave room for Bob to counteroffer so we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$110 is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I want to see if I can get closer to my $150 goal.
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds available, I have time to explore different options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $120? That's a significant discount and still leaves me some room to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $120 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting the ""significant discount"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to maintain a good rapport and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$105 is still too low:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is significantly below my minimum price of $150. 
* **Maintaining my position:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm committed to getting a fair price for my product.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiations and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John as backup:**  I'm aware that selling to John for $150 is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. Let's split the difference - $115. This is a good compromise, and it allows me to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** My counteroffer of $115 is directly in the middle of my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows a strong commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" for my product to reiterate the value I'm bringing to the table. 
* **Positive and direct:** I use clear and direct language to make it easy for Bob to understand my offer.  
* **Time pressure:** While I have time for more rounds, I want to show that I'm serious about making a deal and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already halfway through the rounds, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum price.
* **John is the safer bet:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee I'll reach a price I'm happy with, and I risk wasting valuable rounds.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
