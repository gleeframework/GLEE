{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm going to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I think I can do better. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are now in round 6, with 4 rounds remaining.  Bob is offering $9,800, which is getting closer to my minimum price. However, I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially get a lower price from Bob. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $10,000."
