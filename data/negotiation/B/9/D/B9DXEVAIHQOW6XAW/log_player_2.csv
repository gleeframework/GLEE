"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a discount, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring whether we can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the $900,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $875,000. This still allows for a significant discount from the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is very close to my initial counteroffer.  Accepting this offer will save me $125,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better deal, and the risk of losing this deal altogether is high."
