Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the $900,000 mark.

This still allows for a significant discount from the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
