"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a discount, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the $900,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $875,000. This still allows for a significant discount from the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the value you've placed on it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
