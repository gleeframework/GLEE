"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible, and $125 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $125 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
