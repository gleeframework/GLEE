Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us, giving me a good price and you still making a profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
