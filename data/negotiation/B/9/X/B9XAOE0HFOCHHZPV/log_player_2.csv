# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and at this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,000,000 rather than risk Alice sticking to her price or further dragging out the negotiation."
