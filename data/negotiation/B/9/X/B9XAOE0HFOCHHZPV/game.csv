"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $900,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
