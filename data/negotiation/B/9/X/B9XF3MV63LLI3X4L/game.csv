"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to a realistic price point, I can't accept that low of an offer.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I'm confident this investment will pay dividends for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
