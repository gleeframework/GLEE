"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's well below its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
