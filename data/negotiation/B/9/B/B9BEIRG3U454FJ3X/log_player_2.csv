It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very slowly coming down and we're getting into a pattern of splitting the difference.  While we might be able to get her a little lower, it's very unlikely she'll go below $1,300,000 and the sure thing of $1,000,000 from John is the better business decision at this point."
