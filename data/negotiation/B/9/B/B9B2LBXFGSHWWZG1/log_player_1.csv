"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  There's a significant gap between Bob's offer and the value he places on the product. I'll try to close that gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This gives us both a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far apart. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 below my last counteroffer.  With only 6 rounds left, I need to weigh the risk of continuing negotiations against the potential gain.  I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better price from Bob, and selling to John for $1,200,000 would be worse.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
