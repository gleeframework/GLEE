"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to meet you halfway from $1600000. How about $1520000? I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value and my budget.",1520000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1520000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $1580000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1580000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price. How about $1550000? I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
