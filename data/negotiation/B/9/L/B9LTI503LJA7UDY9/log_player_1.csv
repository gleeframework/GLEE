Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. This framing aims to make the offer more appealing than a simple number."
