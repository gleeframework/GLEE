"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is above your maximum budget and leaves you with little room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you can try to get Alice to lower her price or proceed with your backup option of buying from John for $1,000,000."
