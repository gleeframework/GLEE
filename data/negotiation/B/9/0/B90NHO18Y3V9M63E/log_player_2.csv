"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm happy to buy the product for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering the product's worth to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. Let's meet in the middle at $13500. It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  The price of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good saving compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer in this round is a good decision as it secures the product at a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
