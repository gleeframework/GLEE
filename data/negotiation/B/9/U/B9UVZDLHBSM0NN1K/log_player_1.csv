"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly above my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, but I'm not ready to walk away yet.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $1,150,000. This is a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
