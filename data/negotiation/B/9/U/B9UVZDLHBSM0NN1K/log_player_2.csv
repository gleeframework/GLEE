"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is far above your budget and even above your maximum valuation. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly above my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious starting point:**  By starting significantly lower than my actual maximum, I leave room for negotiation and signal that Alice's initial offer is unrealistic.
* **Gauging Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.  Her response will give me a better sense of her bottom line. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While my counteroffer is low, it's still within a range where we might be able to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still significantly above your $1,200,000 maximum. 
* **Negotiation progress:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate is a good sign. However, her counteroffer suggests she may be aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between your first offer and hers, which wouldn't work for you. 
* **Alternative option:**  You have a viable alternative in John's offer, giving you leverage to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $1,150,000. This is a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward movement but within limits:** Increasing the offer to $1,150,000 shows Alice you are willing to compromise but sets a firm boundary below your absolute maximum.
* **Justification:** Providing reasons related to market value and your budget reinforces that your offer is serious and well-considered.
* **Leaving room for a final push:** There's a small buffer between this offer and your maximum in case Alice is willing to meet you close to your limit."
