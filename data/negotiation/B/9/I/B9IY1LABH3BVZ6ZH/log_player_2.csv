"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good but not great.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so $12,000 is a decent saving.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is still a fair profit for you and a good deal for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than its value to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** She's come down from $12,000 to $11,000, which is a good compromise.
* **You're still saving money.**  $11,000 is significantly lower than your maximum price of $15,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation.**  If you reject this offer, you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even increasing the price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, as it saves you money while minimizing risk."
