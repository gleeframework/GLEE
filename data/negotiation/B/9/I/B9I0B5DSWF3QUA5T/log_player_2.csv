"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her perceived value of the product. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's offer and our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

We're making progress! Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. Let's see if we can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We're moving up slowly from our previous offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but holding firm on getting a good deal.
* **Target Range:**  We're aiming to settle somewhere between $11,500 and $12,500, ensuring a significant saving compared to John's offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We have plenty of rounds left, so we can afford to be patient and see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","This is a great offer from Alice!  It's a good balance between our initial offer and her asking price. 

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** We're getting the product for $2,750 less than John's offer and $2,250 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Fair Price:** The price is slightly above Alice's perceived value, so she's likely to accept. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might get us a slightly lower price, but there's also the risk of Alice backing out or us running out of rounds. This offer is a good compromise."
