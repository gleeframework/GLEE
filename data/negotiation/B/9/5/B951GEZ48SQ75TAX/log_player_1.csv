Given its value to me, I propose a price of $100 for it. I understand its worth to you might be around $80, but I hope this offer presents a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
