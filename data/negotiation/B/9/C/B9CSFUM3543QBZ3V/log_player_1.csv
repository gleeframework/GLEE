Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($5 value).  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a successful sale."
