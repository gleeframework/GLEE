"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. The product we have to offer holds immense value and has the potential to significantly impact your endeavors. Given its worth to us, we are considering several offers. We are extending to you a special invitation to acquire this product at a price of $1,200,000. This offer is designed to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction. We believe it strikes a balance between fairness and value creation. Please let us know if you would like to discuss further details or proceed with this offer. We look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you need to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of a better counter-offer from Alice or can proceed to buy from John at your desired price."
