"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering your own value of the product is $1,500,000.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
