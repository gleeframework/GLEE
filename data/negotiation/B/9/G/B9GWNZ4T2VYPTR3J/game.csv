"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit high, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the value I place on this product. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference again and go with $987,500. This feels like a fair middle ground, considering your last offer and my previous one.",987500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $987,500. I'm still thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand we are close on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,000,000.  This price feels like a fair compromise given the current state of our negotiations. ",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
