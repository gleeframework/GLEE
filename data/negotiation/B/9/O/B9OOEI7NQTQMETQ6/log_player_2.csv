"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I believe it's a valuable asset that can bring significant benefit to your business.  My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, your initial price is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is my best offer, but I am open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is lower than what I need, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a price closer to Bob's target.  Buying from John right now would mean getting the product for a lower price, but it also eliminates the possibility of a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  To demonstrate my willingness to reach a deal, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, it's still above Bob's preferred budget. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to try and squeeze out a better price.  Buying from John now would be cheaper, but it might be possible to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, it's still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to stick to my previous offer of $950,000. This is my final price, and I believe it represents a fair value for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated that $950,000 is her final offer. Bob has already made a counteroffer that was rejected.  Continuing the negotiation will likely result in a stalemate.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he gets the product at a price within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
