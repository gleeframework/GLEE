Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, so that's my baseline.
* **Trying to maximize profit:** I'm aiming for a higher price to potentially earn more. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering $1,500,000 is a risk, but it's also a significant potential reward. If Bob is very interested in the product, he might be willing to pay this price.

**Reasoning behind the offer:**

This offer is a calculated risk.  I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer at a lower price.  This strategy balances my desire to maximize profits with the need to secure a sale."
