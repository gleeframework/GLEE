""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its worth to someone like you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what I value the product at. I believe I can negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is definitely getting closer to a price I'd accept, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to push for a bit more, especially with this many rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,325,000 is close, but I need the number to be a bit higher to make this work on my end. How about we settle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $1,325,000? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly holding firm at $1,325,000. While I could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away or the negotiations will stall. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of John changing his offer."
