Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Fallback Option:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're still guaranteed to sell the product to John for your minimum acceptable price."
