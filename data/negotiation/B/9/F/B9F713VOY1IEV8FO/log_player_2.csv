# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for $200,000 less than your maximum price and what John is offering. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price, so it's a good idea to accept this offer."
