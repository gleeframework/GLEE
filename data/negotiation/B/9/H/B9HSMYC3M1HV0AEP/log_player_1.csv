Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high potential profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's enthusiasm and willingness to negotiate. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he counters, you can adjust your strategy accordingly.
* **Walk-Away Option:** Remember, you always have John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net. This gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer is the best course of action because:

* **Signal Value:** Rejecting a lowball offer shows Bob you're serious about the product's worth. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a substantial gap between your asking price and his offer, providing ample space for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives you the confidence to push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $875,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  This offer splits the difference between your last offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  It's important to reiterate the product's value and back up your counteroffer with a reason that resonates with Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active while still leaving you room to potentially accept a slightly lower price if needed.  Remember, you have John's offer as a backup if Bob remains unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about $800,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer.  While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a slightly higher price with Bob, it's a minimal gain for the risk of continuing the negotiation. 

* **Matching Offers:** There's no financial advantage to choosing John over Bob at this point.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer now allows you to close the deal quickly, avoiding potential delays or complications that could arise from further negotiation.
* **Certainty:** A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.  Accepting the sure $800,000 mitigates the risk of Bob walking away completely."
