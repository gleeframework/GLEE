Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation. It also tests Bob's eagerness and potentially secures a higher profit.
* **Backup Offer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John,  so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message vaguely implies the product's value to justify the high price without revealing our absolute bottom line.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We can always negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial price."
