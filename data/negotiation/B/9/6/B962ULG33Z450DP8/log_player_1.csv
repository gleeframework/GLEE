I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a good chance of getting a higher price than my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

This is a strategic price point:

* **High enough to be appealing:**  If Bob values the product highly, he'll likely be willing to pay a premium.
* **Not too high to be unrealistic:** It's a significant markup, but not so high that Bob would automatically reject it out of hand.

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
