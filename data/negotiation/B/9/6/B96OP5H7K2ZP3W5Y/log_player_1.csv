Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Gain:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower. You start by aiming for the maximum you can get.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product's value to be unique or if there's urgency. Starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **First-Refusal Psychology:** By stating you're offering it to Bob first, you create a subtle sense of scarcity and potential loss if he doesn't take the offer.

This strategy aims to get Bob to consider the value proposition seriously and potentially negotiate closer to your desired price. Even if he rejects the initial offer, you haven't lost anything as you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
