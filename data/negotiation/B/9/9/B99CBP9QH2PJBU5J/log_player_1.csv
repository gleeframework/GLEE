Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's still cheaper than his perceived value) while maximizing your profit. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but starting at $140 gives you room to potentially go down slightly while still making a significant profit."
