"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price, hoping to get closer to his maximum limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that the product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to find an agreement.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,250,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has reduced her price considerably, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a decision.  Since he's already rejected Alice's previous offer, it's unlikely she'll come down to $1,000,000.  It's more prudent for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
