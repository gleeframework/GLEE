"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to ensure it's within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm eager to make this deal work, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves a healthy profit for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground here, as I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,325,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
