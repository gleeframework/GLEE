"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. It's significantly below my minimum price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $8,750 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $8,375. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8375.0,Bob,4,
