"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't justify spending $10,000 on it at this time. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 isn't quite enough for me at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to justify spending $9,000 on the product. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,4,
