Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to me is significant, but I am hoping to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $750,000 for the product.

I reject Bob's offer because it's too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, but gives me a bit more room.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

I will accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, his offer of $800,000 is exactly what John is offering, and it's a fair price for the product.  It saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
