"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
