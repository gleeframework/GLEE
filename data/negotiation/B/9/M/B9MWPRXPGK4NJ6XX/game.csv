"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us. If you decline, I will have to move on to other opportunities.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
