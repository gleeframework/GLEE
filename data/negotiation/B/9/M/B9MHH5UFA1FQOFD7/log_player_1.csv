"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number ($1,300,000), you set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects this initial price, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to your starting point than if you had started lower.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its potential and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and John's standing offer. There's room for negotiation, and you haven't exhausted your rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $900,000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate, which helps build rapport. 
* **Significant Concession (but not too much):** By dropping $150,000 from your initial price, you demonstrate a willingness to make a deal while still remaining significantly above both your minimum and John's offer.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** This common negotiation tactic aims to make your counteroffer seem more reasonable and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,150,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically, but he's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  You have the security of John's offer and plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if you can bring Bob closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down further. How about $1,075,000? That's a substantial decrease from my initial offer and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial outcome."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** You start by recognizing the negotiation process and Bob's efforts, which helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Another Significant Concession:** You lower your price by $75,000, demonstrating continued flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Eagerness:** By stating your desire for a ""mutually beneficial outcome,"" you subtly remind Bob that you have other options (John) while still aiming for a deal with him.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  You are now just $75,000 above your absolute minimum and have moved closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's first counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer again. How about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Here's why:

* **Unlikely to Move:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer in $25,000 increments. At this rate, it will take many more rounds to even get close to your minimum price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. Time is a factor, and John's offer represents a guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **Setting a Precedent:** By accepting a price significantly lower than your initial offers, you risk appearing overly eager or devaluing the product in future negotiations.

While there's always a chance Bob might make a much higher offer, the current trajectory and the guaranteed offer from John make selling to John the most rational decision."
