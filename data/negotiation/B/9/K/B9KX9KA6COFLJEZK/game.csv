"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $128.50. It's a fair price for both of us and I'm willing to close the deal at that point.",128.5,Alice,5,,
