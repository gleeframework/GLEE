"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a real game-changer, and I know you'll appreciate its value. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle around $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the value while working for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  I think that's a reasonable compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While I understand your desire for a lower price, $1,175,000 is still below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,187,500? I'm eager to acquire the product, and I think this compromise would benefit both of us.",1187500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $1,187,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,193,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",1193750.0,Alice,7,
