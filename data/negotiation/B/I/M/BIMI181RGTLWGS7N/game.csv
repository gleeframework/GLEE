"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your perspective on the value. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,075,000. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. Would $1,110,000 be agreeable to you? It's a strong offer for a product of this caliber.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another move. I'll counter with $1,090,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
