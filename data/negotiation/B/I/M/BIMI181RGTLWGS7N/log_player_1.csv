Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your perspective on the value. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,075,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000, and we're not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. Would $1,110,000 be agreeable to you? It's a strong offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to the later rounds, so making smaller concessions shows we're serious about closing the deal but not desperate.  This offer is a strong compromise, balancing Bob's desired price range with our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another move. I'll counter with $1,090,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is a good compromise. It's above our absolute minimum and keeps us a comfortable margin above John's offer. Accepting now ensures we close the deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price lower or Bob walking away."
