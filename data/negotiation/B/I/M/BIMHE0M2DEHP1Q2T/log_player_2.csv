"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There is room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

{""message"": ""While I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This represents a fair value for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still allows you to save some money, but also reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still a bit high. While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action to try to secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while to sell the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's preferred price.  Although there's a chance Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  John's offer, while higher than Bob's ideal, is the only guaranteed way to acquire the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
