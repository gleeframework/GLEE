""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be good for me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000? "",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but $950,000 is still beyond my spending limit.  Could you consider coming down to $800,000 even? That's the absolute highest I can go."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up, and I understand your budget constraints.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can't go below $900,000. I believe that's a fair and final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go below $900,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer is a guaranteed $800,000, which is our target price."
