"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I think it could really benefit your business.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's benefits and inviting Bob's input. This encourages a collaborative negotiation. 
* **Leaving John Unmentioned:**  At this point, there's no need to mention John. Introducing another buyer could make Bob feel pressured or like I'm not serious about negotiating with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be good for me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low. Accepting would mean a significant loss compared to both my minimum and John's standing offer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Conciliatory:** I'm making it clear that Bob's offer was unacceptable, but I'm also signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is a substantial move from my initial price, showing Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Still Profitable:** $950,000 is still a profitable price for me, though it leaves less room for further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $950,000 is still beyond my spending limit.  Could you consider coming down to $800,000 even? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his stated maximum price. While this is a better offer, it's still a substantial difference from what John is offering. It's worth one more attempt to see if I can bridge the gap before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up, and I understand your budget constraints.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can't go below $900,000. I believe that's a fair and final offer."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer to signal seriousness and limit back-and-forth. 
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down to $900,000 shows some movement, but it's a small enough concession that maintains the product's value.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing fairness and value helps justify the firm stance while keeping the tone positive. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects this, I'm prepared to accept John's offer to avoid further time investment and potential for a worse deal."
