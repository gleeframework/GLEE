"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's no point in accepting it. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $13,000 is still above Bob's comfortable limit.  There's room for further negotiation.  Bob should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into negotiating with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget. While Bob could counteroffer again, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to budge significantly.  Given that Bob can secure the product from John for $10,000, it's the most financially sensible decision to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
