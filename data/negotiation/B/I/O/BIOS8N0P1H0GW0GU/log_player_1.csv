Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy for $800,000, Bob values the product much higher. This presents an opportunity to make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice ($300,000) while still giving Bob a $100,000 discount compared to his perceived value.
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By framing the offer as a pre-public sale, it adds a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a more complex scenario with multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers, the approach might change."
