{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also a fantastic opportunity for you. My initial offer is $1,750,000. This reflects the value I know it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to put into this product. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is still a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer. How about $1,500,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting my minimum asking price, and it avoids further negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for the same price."
