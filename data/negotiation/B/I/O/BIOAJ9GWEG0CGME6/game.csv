"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to put into this product. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer. How about $1,500,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
