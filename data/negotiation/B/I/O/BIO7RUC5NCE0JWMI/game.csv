"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a little high for me.  I could go up to $1,350,000.  That's a fair offer considering John's price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to balance your budget with the value the product brings to you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1,550,000, which is still a discount from my original price but reflects the value it brings to you. This is my final offer, so I hope you can see the value in it.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
