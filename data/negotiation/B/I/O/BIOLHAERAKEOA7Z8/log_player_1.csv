Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will find this price attractive considering the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer considering the value of the product to him and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than selling to John.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away completely and me ending up with John's $8,000 offer outweighs the potential gains."
