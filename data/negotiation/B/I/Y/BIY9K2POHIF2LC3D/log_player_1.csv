```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm countering with $17,500. This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully, a more reasonable price for Bob considering he offered $10,000.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm countering with $16,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, as I can sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000. I'll take John's offer and secure the sale."
