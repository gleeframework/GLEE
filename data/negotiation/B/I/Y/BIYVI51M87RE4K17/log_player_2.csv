# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,200,000 is less than your $1,500,000 limit.
* **You save money:**  Buying from Alice saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though Alice is likely making a profit, it's still a good deal for you to secure the product at a lower price."
