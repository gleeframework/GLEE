"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering your stated value for the product, and it gives us both a chance to walk away with a decent deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. How about we settle on $13,250? I'm willing to make a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,4,
