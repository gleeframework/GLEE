"I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down a little to $1080000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1080000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $1030000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1030000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your number, but $1030000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1060000 as a final compromise.  This gives you a fantastic deal, and it's a price I can live with. Let's close this deal.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1060000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1060000 and $1030000, which is $1045000. This is my best and final offer.",1045000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your number, but $1045000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1050000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1045000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer.",1045000.0,Bob,8,
