"Hello Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that is valued at $1,500,000 by us, and we believe it would be worth $800,000 to you. We hope you find this offer compelling and look forward to discussing its details further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After reviewing your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $850,000. This amount still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging the value you place on the product. We're confident that this offer strikes a balance between our interests and yours, and we look forward to your consideration.",850000.0,Alice,3,
