"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer on this round, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $975,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
