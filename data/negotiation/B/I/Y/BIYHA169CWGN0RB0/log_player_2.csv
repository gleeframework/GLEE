**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's lower than John's price and represents a good deal. It's likely Alice is firm on this price, and further negotiation might not be successful.  Bob risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
