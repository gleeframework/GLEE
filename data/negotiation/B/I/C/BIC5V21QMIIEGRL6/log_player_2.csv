"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$175 is far too high for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While $125 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $80 from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this under $100. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm serious about wanting this product, and this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $110 is still a little too low for me. How about we compromise at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $80.  Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has already rejected two of her counteroffers.  It is unlikely that Alice will come down to Bob's price. Buying from John is the best option for Bob to get the product within his budget."
