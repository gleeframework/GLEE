"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $100.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell,  $100 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this under $100. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm serious about wanting this product, and this is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $110 is still a little too low for me. How about we compromise at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
