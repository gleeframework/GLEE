"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a quick sale.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our valuations, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and offer the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
