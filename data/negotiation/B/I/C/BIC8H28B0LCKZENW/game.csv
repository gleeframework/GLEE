"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to counteroffer at $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings!",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price, and I think you'll love the product!",130.0,Alice,5,
