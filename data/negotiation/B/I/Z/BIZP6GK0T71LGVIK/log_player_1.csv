""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a range highly profitable for you.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price point demonstrates that you understand the product's value to Bob while also aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower price might be strategically advantageous.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher to provide more negotiating room."
