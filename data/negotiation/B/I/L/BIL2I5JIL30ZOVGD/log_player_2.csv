# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and developed to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. This exceptional item is not just a product; it's an investment that will significantly enhance your business operations or personal endeavors. Given its immense value, we believe it is worth $1,500,000 to you. However, to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant savings compared to its market value. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this exceptional deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly more than what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and open the door for a counter-offer closer to John's price."
