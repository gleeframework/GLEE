"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I can offer you a price of $9,250. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer you a price of $9,375. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",9375.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,375 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000. It's a significant amount from my previous offer, and I believe we can both be happy with this price. Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,8,

"I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $9,375. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9,187.50. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",9187.5,Alice,9,
