Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's space for him to counter without you having to accept a price below your desired range.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but also that you value your product."
