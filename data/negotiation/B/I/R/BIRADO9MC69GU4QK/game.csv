"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This way we both get a good deal, and we can move forward with the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
