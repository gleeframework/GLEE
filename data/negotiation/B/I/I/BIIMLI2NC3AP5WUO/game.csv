"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
