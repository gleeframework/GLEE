Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Negotiation Space:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Confident Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential ROI justifies the high price and positions it as an investment rather than an expense.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while mitigating the risk of losing the sale altogether."
