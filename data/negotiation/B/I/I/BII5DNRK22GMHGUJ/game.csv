"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $77? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value.",77.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $77 is closer, but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I can do $75, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value. What do you think?",75.0,Alice,5,
