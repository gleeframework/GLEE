"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $9,500?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this offer?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,250 is still significantly lower than what I need.  How about $9,750? That's a compromise from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
