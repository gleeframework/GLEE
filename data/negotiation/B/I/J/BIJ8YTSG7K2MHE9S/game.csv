"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $16000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. ",14500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about this: I'll bring the price down to $15200 for the product. This is still above the original asking price, but closer to your proposed figure. I hope this helps move us towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",15200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $15200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $14800 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",14800.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Let's try $15000 as the final price for the product. This aligns closely with your offer and maximizes the value for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
