"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $14,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer it to you for $16,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",16500.0,Alice,5,
