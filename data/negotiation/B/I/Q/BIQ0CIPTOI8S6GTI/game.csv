"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a bit high, but $10,000 is significantly less than what it's worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you think the product is worth more, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we try $15,500? That's a significant reduction on my end, and I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. That's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
