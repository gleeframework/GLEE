Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  Your best bet is to aim high, knowing you have John as a safety net.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment that will pay off significantly in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1750000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,750,000 sets a high anchor. While it's unlikely Bob will accept, it gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" emphasize the product's worth, potentially shifting Bob's perception of its value. 
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence about the investment potential makes the offer seem more appealing.

**Outcome**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Unlikely, but you get a fantastic deal.
* **Bob Rejects/Negotiates:**  More probable. You can then gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup.  You can use your interactions with Bob to potentially get John to increase his offer.  

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation. If you knew he was desperate for this product, you might push even higher."
