"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is worth $1000000 to you, but I believe its value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1150000. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still not willing to meet me at $1150000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000 either. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My next offer is $1100000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum. My next offer is $1080000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1080000, and I'm starting to think that's the best we're going to get. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. My next offer is $1060000. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to someone else. This is my final offer.",1060000.0,Alice,9,
