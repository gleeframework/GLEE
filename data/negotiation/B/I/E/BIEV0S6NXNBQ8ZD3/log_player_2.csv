"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer. Even though she claims it's worth $10,000 to me, I have a backup option to buy it from John for $10,000. There's a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice or stick with John if needed."
