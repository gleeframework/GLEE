I've assessed its worth to be at least $1,500,000, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $2,000,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
