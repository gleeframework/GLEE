Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **My Minimum:** I have a minimum price of $800,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000.

By offering $950,000, I'm leaving a significant margin for Bob (he saves $50,000), but I'm also getting a good deal that's closer to my desired price. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting the highest price while still having a fallback option if Bob rejects the offer."
