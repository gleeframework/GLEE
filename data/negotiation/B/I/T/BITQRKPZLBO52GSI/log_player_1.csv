Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I know the true value of this product goes beyond that. Could we meet at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it would bring you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still thinking $1,200,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'll stick with my original counteroffer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome. Since John offers the same price without the hassle of further negotiation, it makes the most sense to sell to John."
