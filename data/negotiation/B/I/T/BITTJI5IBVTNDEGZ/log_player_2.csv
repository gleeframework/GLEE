"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, and ideally want to pay even less. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks great, $150 is a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($80), we aim to understand Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our budget constraints.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice. She knows we have an alternative (John) and might be more willing to negotiate rather than lose the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is negotiating, $110 is still above our maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room to haggle a bit further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $95? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not dramatically. This signals to Alice that we're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.
* **Target Price:**  $95 is a good middle ground that represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer while still being potentially profitable for her. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are moving closer to John's price, subtly implying that our patience isn't limitless."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm at a price that's not ideal for us.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $105.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the convenience and guaranteed price offered by John."
