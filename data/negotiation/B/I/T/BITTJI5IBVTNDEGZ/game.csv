"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,5,
