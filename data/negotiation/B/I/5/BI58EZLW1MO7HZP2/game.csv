"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $20000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is significantly below what this product is worth, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $17500? It's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I can go up to $12000. This is a fair price that allows us to both find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget limitations, but $12000 is still too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a fair price that allows for both our needs to be met.  Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. However, $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000,  which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer. $13000 is a significant increase, but it's still a little below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'll offer the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price that allows us to both be satisfied with the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,7,
