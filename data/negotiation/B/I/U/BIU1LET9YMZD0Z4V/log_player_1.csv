Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
