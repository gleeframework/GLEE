"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  This gives me some room to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'll use this round to try and understand Bob's maximum price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm looking for something closer to $100 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground. This shows flexibility while still aiming for my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $94, but I can't go any lower.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum, to show I'm open to compromise.  I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $94 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $94, which would be $93. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$93 is just above my minimum of $90, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's a good compromise and a reasonable deal for both of us.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
