"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  That's a fair compromise that gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,250, which would be $12,625. Would you be willing to accept this price?",12625.0,Bob,4,
