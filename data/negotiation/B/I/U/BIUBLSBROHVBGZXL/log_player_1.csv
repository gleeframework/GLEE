{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, with a potential $1000 profit for him, while also ensuring I earn more than my minimum desired $12,000.  It's a starting point for negotiation, leaving room for counteroffers and a potential mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. It's better than selling to John, but there's still room for a better deal. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  That's a fair compromise that gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,250, which would be $12,625. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum desired price of $12,000, and it's a good compromise considering our back-and-forth. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit, while rejecting it risks further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
