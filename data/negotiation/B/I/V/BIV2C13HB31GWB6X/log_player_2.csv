# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to exceed your expectations. This product is not just an item; it's a testament to innovation and excellence. Given its unique features and high-quality materials, we believe its value exceeds $8000. For a limited time, I am offering you the opportunity to own this product at a special introductory price of $7500. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a piece that is both valuable and exclusive. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,500 is lower than the $10,000 you would pay John.  This means you save $2,500 by accepting Alice's offer. Even though you don't know the product's value to Alice, saving money is the best strategy in this scenario."
