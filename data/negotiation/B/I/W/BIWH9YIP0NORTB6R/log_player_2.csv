"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between their maximum and Alice's minimum price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Bob acknowledges the product's value but establishes a clear price point for a potential deal.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message conveys willingness to negotiate further, inviting Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, closer to Bob's desired price and a significant improvement from the initial offer. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks reaching the end of the 10 rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Saving Money:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
