"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to keep costs down, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the game! I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package and a 6-month warranty. That way, you'll get even more value out of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
