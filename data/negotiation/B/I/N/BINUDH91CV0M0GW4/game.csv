"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,000 is closer, I'd still need to be closer to $8,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
