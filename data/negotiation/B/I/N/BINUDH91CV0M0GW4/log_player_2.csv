"Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $10,000.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses with Alice and buy from John."
