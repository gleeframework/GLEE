# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better deal.  He's already rejected the same price once, and it's only $1,000 away from his max budget.  He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm really hoping to reach a deal for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and respects our respective budgets.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell at $9,500. I'll make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is my final offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still $750 above Bob's maximum budget, and he has only 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's more likely that Alice will not budge further, and Bob will end up paying more than his target.  John offers a guaranteed price within his budget, so it's the safer option."
