Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $11,500 gives you some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Strong but Fair:**  This offer allows Bob to still gain a significant benefit ($500) from the transaction, making it more likely he'll accept. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations."
