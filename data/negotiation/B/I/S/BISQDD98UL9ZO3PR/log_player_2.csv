The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $10,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's original price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations."

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's lower than her first offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't go above my $12,000 limit."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $11,000. This is a good compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a fair price."
