Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a discount:** $825,000 is significantly less than Alice's starting price and her product's value to her.
* **It's below your maximum:** You're staying under your $800,000 limit.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice becoming less flexible or you might accidentally push her away from a reasonable deal."
