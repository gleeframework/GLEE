"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can likely get a better price than $95.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a slightly lower price.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
