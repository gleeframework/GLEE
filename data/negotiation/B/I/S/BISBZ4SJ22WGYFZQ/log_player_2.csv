"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. It's truly a unique opportunity to own something that's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so anything below that is a good deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price and still leaves room for profit for Alice. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to save money."
