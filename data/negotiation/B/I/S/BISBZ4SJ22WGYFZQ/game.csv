"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. It's truly a unique opportunity to own something that's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
