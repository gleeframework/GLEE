"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
