I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives Bob room to negotiate and hopefully motivates him to make a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can gauge his interest and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort. While I could counteroffer again, I'm concerned that he's not willing to budge much further.  To avoid potentially losing even more money, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
