"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. After careful consideration and evaluation, I am extending an offer to purchase this item for $950,000. This price reflects its true worth and ensures a fair transaction for both parties involved. I understand its significance to you and believe it's a fair compromise between its value to you and my asking price. I look forward to discussing the details further and potentially making this acquisition a reality. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* While buying from John for $1,200,000 is your absolute limit, it's not ideal. 
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This opens the door for a counter-offer that's closer to your desired price range."
