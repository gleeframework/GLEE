Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and I can still potentially get a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $11,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,000? This is a really great product, and I'm confident you'll make good use of it. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,800 is close to John's offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more from Bob.  The product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm not comfortable going lower than $10,800, I'm willing to split the difference with you. How about $11,400? This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is just slightly above John's offer of $10,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better to secure a sale than risk losing both Bob and John.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit and minimizes the risk of a deal falling through."
