"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. How about we try $125? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,
