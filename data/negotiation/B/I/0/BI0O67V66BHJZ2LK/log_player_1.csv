"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum desired price ($100).  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product's value and potential benefits can increase Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a deal as close to my minimum price as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate.  The threat of selling to John provides leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $95. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I consider the product worth to me. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get closer to my desired price in future rounds.
* **John's Offer:** The possibility of selling to John for $100 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Strategy:**

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept an offer below my minimum. I'm using the threat of selling to John as a bargaining chip."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get at least $100 for this product.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see all it can do. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing my ground on my minimum price while presenting it as a compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value keeps the focus on its worth.
* **Clear and Concise:** A direct and straightforward message leaves no room for misinterpretation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to reach a compromise that's fair to both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John as the remaining rounds are limited, and I need to secure a price that meets my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my initial offer. How about $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer allows me to keep negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to carefully consider my options, but I'm not ready to settle for a price below my minimum just yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the remaining rounds to avoid losing out on a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're coming closer to my price. How about we split the difference and settle on $98?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. 
* **Fairness:**  Emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us can encourage Bob to agree.
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm trying to reach a quick agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to make concessions to reach a deal before the time limit runs out. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
