"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,750,000.  This price reflects the product's exceptional value and provides a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Considering the value we both agree on, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is a fair price, it's slightly below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,550,000. This price still reflects the product's value, while acknowledging the limitations of your budget.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
