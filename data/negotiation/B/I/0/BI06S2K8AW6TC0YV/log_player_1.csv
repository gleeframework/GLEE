"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, but still within a range that might be acceptable. This gives me room to negotiate and incentivizes Bob to counteroffer. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to create a positive initial interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I'd like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little higher. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110,  considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also maintaining a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about $112? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm inching closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a price point that's higher than his last offer. I'm emphasizing a fair compromise to make him feel like he's getting a good deal, and I'm also setting the stage for a potential closing offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $108 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$108 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push him a little higher.  I have only four rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm making my final counteroffer, aiming for the middle ground again. I'm creating urgency by stating this is my final offer and pushing Bob to consider a closing deal."
