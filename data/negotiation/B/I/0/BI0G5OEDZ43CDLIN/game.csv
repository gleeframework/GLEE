"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still a little high for me.  How about $7,900, and we have a deal?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,900. I'll meet you at $8,100, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",8100.0,Alice,7,
