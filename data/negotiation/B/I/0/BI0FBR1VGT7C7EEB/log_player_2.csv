"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a substantial discount from its true value to me. I know you're looking for a good deal, and this could be the perfect opportunity. However, if you decide not to accept, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her stated value, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000.  There's no need to pay more than your guaranteed fallback option."
