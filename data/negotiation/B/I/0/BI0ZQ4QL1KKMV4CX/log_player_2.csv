"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's above Bob's maximum budget, and there's significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and attempt to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my assessment of its value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to lower the price considerably. This demonstrates his seriousness in negotiating and sets the stage for further discussions. He also emphasizes fairness and a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my asking price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  There's still room to bridge the gap, and Bob doesn't want to rush into an agreement that isn't favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $850,000, which is a fair compromise given our respective valuations.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price. His counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. By suggesting a ""fair compromise"" and emphasizing a desire to reach an agreement, Bob is trying to build momentum toward a successful deal."
