"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $120, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. I'm hoping he'll counter with a price closer to my desired range. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is above my minimum of $100 and is a reasonable compromise.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering the time constraint and the risk of losing out to John."
