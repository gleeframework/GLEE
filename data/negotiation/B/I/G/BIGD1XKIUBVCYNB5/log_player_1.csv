"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, however, $60 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $75?  That's a fair price and closer to what I had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good point to accept.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $75 is still a profit over your minimum ($80).
* **Saves Time:** Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth and potential for the deal to fall through. 
* **Uncertainty:**  While you *might* get Bob higher, there's also the chance he walks away with further negotiation."
