{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's something that I know will be incredibly useful to you. My initial asking price is $1,200,000, a fair price considering its true value.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still allow you to get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your asking price, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $975000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get a bit higher before selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $975,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference again - $1,012,500. This would be a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
