"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final counteroffer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
