"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $10,800, which is within Bob's budget of $10,000.  While Bob would ideally pay $10,000, the $800 difference is a small enough price to pay for a product that's worth $12,000 to Alice.  It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a lower price, so it's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
