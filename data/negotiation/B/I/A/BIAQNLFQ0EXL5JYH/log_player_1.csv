"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) but still within a range that Bob might consider, given his perceived value of $100. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone might encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for room to come down if necessary without sacrificing too much of my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can't go higher than $100.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob is willing to pay $100, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $150 is a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Value:**  $125 is still above my minimum acceptable price and is a reasonable price considering Bob's willingness to pay $100.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate that this is still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $110? I'm really hoping we can reach a deal, as I'm very interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for better deal:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a higher price.
* **John's offer:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $150 if negotiations with Bob fail.  

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $115?  It's a small step up, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but not going too far. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate that this is still a good deal for Bob and emphasize the possibility of closing the deal. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This small increase shows I'm willing to negotiate but also pushes Bob closer to my acceptable price range."
