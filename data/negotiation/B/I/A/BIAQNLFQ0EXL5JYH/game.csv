"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can't go higher than $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $110? I'm really hoping we can reach a deal, as I'm very interested in the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $115?  It's a small step up, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",115.0,Alice,5,
