"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to stay within my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my limit and the value you've placed on it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget, and it's still significantly more than what John is offering. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
