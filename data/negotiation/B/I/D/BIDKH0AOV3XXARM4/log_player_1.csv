Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant price reduction from my true value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect for him, emphasizing the price reduction.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially reaching a price acceptable to both of us. 

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can switch to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  I can use this opportunity to try and reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a backup.**  Knowing I have John as a buyer for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This will show him I am willing to negotiate but also maintain my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still quite low.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to still make a profit while offering you a significant discount."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while still expressing that it's too low. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:**  $1,200,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This is a reasonable compromise.
* **Focus on Benefits:** I'm highlighting the ""fair price"" aspect for both of us, emphasizing the mutual benefit of this deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my desired profit margin. It increases the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if needed and sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off on what I can do.  How about we try $1,100,000?  That's a big jump on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While Bob has increased his offer, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation space is narrowing.**  Bob's willingness to increase his offer shows he's interested in the product, but we're still quite far apart.  
* **John is my safety net.**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 at any time, giving me leverage in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but lower than my previous counteroffer.  This will show him that I'm still willing to negotiate, but also protect my minimum desired profit margin.  I'll aim for a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand we're getting closer, though. Would you consider $1,150,000? It's a smaller jump from your offer, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between Bob's offer of $1,100,000 and my previous offer of $1,200,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Emphasizing Progress:** I acknowledge that we're getting closer, highlighting the positive progress in the negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize that both of us could be ""happy"" with the price, making it seem like a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility without compromising my minimum desired profit margin. It's a reasonable price point that could potentially lead to a deal with Bob, but I am still prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting close. To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to, and $1,150,000 is just outside of it. My best offer is $1,125,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's a slight increase, $1,125,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiation space.**  We've gone through several rounds, and Bob's budget constraint seems to be a real limitation. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **John offers the best option.**  I can confidently sell to John for $1,500,000, guaranteeing my desired profit and avoiding further negotiations.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses with Bob.  I've tried to negotiate, but I'm not going to risk ending up with a price much lower than my minimum.  John provides a guaranteed higher price and a quick close."
