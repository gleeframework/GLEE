Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you before considering other buyers.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's value and your preference for Bob as a buyer, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet you closer to his $800,000 valuation, while still keeping you well above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You hold a strong position with John as a backup buyer."
