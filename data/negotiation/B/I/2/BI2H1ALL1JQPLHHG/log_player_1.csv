Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm starting with an offer slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($120) to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more. I believe this is a fair starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $125, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows some flexibility. I believe this counteroffer is fair and reasonable while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing time and potentially getting a lower offer.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
