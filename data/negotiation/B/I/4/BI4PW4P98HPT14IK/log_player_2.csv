"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too close to my maximum budget. I'll try negotiating a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A significant counteroffer will reveal how willing she is to negotiate. 
* **Potentially secure a great deal:** If Alice is eager to sell, she might accept a lower offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects my initial offer, there's space to increase my bid gradually.

By starting low, I aim to maximize my potential savings while still expressing genuine interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $75 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, $75 is still above my target. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $65."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for being flexible, Alice. How about we settle at $68? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 68
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:** I'm incrementally raising my offer from $60 to $68, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but not ready to accept her price.
* **Staying below Alice's offer:** By offering less than her proposed $75, I maintain a negotiating position that could lead to further concessions from her side. 
* **Justification:**  Framing the counter-offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Alice to view it positively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $80. How about we meet at $72? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $80, which is understandable as it's her value for the product.  However, I still have room to negotiate before reaching my $100 walk-away point. I'll reject this offer to see if I can get her down to $70 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  Let's make this easy - how about we split the difference and call it $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and simple:** I'm proposing a straightforward compromise to expedite the negotiation. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** By suggesting $70, I'm meeting Alice exactly halfway between her last offer ($72) and my previous counteroffer ($68). 
* **Conveying urgency:**  By using phrases like ""make this easy"" I imply I'm nearing the end of my negotiation window."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'll meet you at $76, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $76. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $76
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has given a firm counteroffer of $76, and it seems unlikely she'll go lower. This price is within my acceptable range, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. It's a good deal compared to John's $100 offer."
