Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product to Bob while framing it as a good deal.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high offer, I'm hoping to:

* **Encourage negotiation:** This allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will tell me if he's serious about buying or just trying to get a low price.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he rejects my offer, I'll need to decide if I want to counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to settle.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can convince him to pay closer to my original asking price.  I will analyze Bob's negotiation style and see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $975,000. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but not give in entirely. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and might lead Bob to reconsider.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to go higher. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I'm closer to accepting his offer or selling to John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's first offer, I demonstrate that I have options and am not desperate for a quick sale. 

I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I would like to stick to my original proposal. I am willing to pay $960,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I would ideally like to get.  However, I've already countered once and Bob's sticking to his position.  This indicates that further negotiation may be unproductive, and I'm unlikely to get a significantly higher offer. 

Given the opportunity to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is offering, it makes more financial sense to sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll inform Bob that I'm going to sell to John, thanking him for his time and consideration. This ends the negotiation with Bob and allows me to secure a higher price for the product."
