"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell for $10,000? That would still be a good profit for you, and a great deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
