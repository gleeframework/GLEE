Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My Minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me (from John's offer).
* **Bob's Maximum:** I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves a negotiation space of $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000).
* **Fair Split:** Offering $1,000,000 splits the potential profit evenly between Bob and me. 

By offering this price, I maximize my chances of getting a higher price than John's offer while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
