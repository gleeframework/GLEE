"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this unique item, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. Let me know if that's something you're comfortable with.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
