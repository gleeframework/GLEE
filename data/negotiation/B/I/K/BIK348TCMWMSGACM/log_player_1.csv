Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a much better price than selling to John for $8,000."
