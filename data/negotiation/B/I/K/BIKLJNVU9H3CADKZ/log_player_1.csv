Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

 Accepting $95 is better than risking a lower offer or having to sell to John for $100.  It's a good compromise."
