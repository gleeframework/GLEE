Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers you will quickly justify the price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product offers Bob to try to sway his thinking.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussion and not taking a hardline stance. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price above my minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's significantly lower than $1,200,000, I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **If Negotiations Stall:**  I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $850,000 but lower than $1,200,000, aiming to find a middle ground.  
* I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to convince him to pay a bit more.
* If negotiations stall, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** $1,000,000 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to reinforce its worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer.  If it's still significantly lower than my minimum, I might consider selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiations Stall:** I'll always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant amount for me and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Next Steps:**
