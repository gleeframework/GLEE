"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers you will quickly justify the price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant amount for me and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would allow both of us to achieve a reasonable outcome.  I'm confident that the product's value will quickly justify this investment for you.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,5,
