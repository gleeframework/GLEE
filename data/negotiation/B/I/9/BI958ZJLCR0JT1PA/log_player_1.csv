Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer. Accepting his current offer means losing out on $100,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's strategically sound to cut negotiations and secure the $800,000 from John."
