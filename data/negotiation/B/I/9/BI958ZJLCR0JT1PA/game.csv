"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",700000.0,Bob,4,
