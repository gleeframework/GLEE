Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer, broken down:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's fallback:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $800,000 to John. This is her ""safety net.""
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Potential for profit:**  There's room for Alice to aim higher than $800,000 with Bob since he values the product at that price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Pricing:**  Pricing the product at $950,000 allows Alice to potentially make a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product might be worth even more in the broader market, justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob negotiating a slightly lower price (still above Alice's minimum).

**Important Notes**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and Alice will have to sell to John for $800,000. However, the potential reward of a higher sale price to Bob might be worth the risk.
* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how aggressively Bob negotiates or if he's willing to pay above his perceived value."
