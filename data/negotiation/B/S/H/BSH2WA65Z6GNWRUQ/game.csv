"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $750000 is a fairer price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm going to counteroffer at $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $850000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I'd like to propose a price of $775000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not ready to accept $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm going to counteroffer at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my maximum budget. I'd like to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $795000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $795000. I'm going to counteroffer at $825000 again, as I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I'm proposing a price of $795000 is too high for me, I'll go a bit lower to $785000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the negotiations we've had so far. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",785000.0,Bob,8,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $785000. I'm going to counteroffer at $815000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I'm afraid we've reached the end of the road. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm proposing a price of $790000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. To be honest, I'm getting close to buying the product from John for $1000000, and I'm not sure I want to go that high. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",790000.0,Bob,10,
