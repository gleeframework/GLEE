Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets a firm anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slightly):** While unlikely in this specific scenario given Bob's valuation, there's a small chance Bob might try to negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $9,500), which would still be a better outcome than selling to John."
