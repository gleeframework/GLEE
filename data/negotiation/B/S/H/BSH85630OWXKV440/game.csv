"I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Would you be willing to accept that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is close, but to be fair to myself I can't go any lower than $14,000.  This is a great deal for you, what do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
