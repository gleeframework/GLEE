"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob values the product at ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm implying the product is valuable by saying ""I think you'd really appreciate it."" This could subconsciously make Bob think the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120 if possible. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I won't sell for less than $150.  Bob's offer is below that.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have room to lower my price slightly in the next round, but I want to see if Bob is willing to budge a little more.  
* **John's Offer:** While I could sell to John for $150, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference?  I'll go down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not giving in entirely.
* **Value Reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to make it seem like a good compromise.
* **Open Invitation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond to my counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving."
