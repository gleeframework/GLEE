"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $17,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives us room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates that I'm open to discussion, creating a less adversarial tone.

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. While it has the potential for a high return, if Bob immediately rejects the offer, I may be forced to lower my price significantly or sell to John. I will need to carefully assess Bob's responses in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation. We've only had one round, and I can likely push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is an option, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I can't go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price, considering the value and quality of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  While I'm not accepting his offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  My message reminds Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By holding firm on my minimum price and showing flexibility, I'm aiming to reach a middle ground with Bob. I will be prepared to counteroffer further if necessary, but I want to see if this price point is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Limited Time:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation process, and I don't want to waste more time on a deal that's not profitable for me.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $15,000, I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob if I push harder.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still higher than his offer. I need to find a sweet spot that's attractive to Bob while ensuring I don't lose too much money. If he rejects again, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down to $14,250. This shows good faith and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still holding out for a price that's above my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. I'm letting Bob know that time is running out and he needs to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's willingness to compromise. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round, as I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're approaching the two-thirds mark of the negotiation. I need to make a decision, as further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** Even if I accept this offer, there's still a chance that Bob might be willing to offer a bit more in future rounds, especially if he realizes the product is worth more to him.

**Decision:**

While this offer isn't ideal, it's close enough to my minimum that it makes sense to accept. There's a high risk of losing the deal if I continue to negotiate, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better price."
