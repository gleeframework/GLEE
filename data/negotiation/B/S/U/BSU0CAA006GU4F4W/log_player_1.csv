Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh it against John's guaranteed $10,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is more than Bob initially offered, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500.  This is closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with some profit.  I'm hoping this compromise will be agreeable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and while I'd prefer to get $10,000, it's not worth risking the deal to keep negotiating. I'll accept his offer and close the sale."
