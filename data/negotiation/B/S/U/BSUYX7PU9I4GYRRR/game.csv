Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your life.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",11000.0,Alice,3,
