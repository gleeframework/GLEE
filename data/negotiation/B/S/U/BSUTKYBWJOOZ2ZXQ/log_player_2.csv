"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product for $80 from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer of $90.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
``` 
 
You're going to offer Alice the price that you're willing to pay from John.  Since she's going to get the product for $100 and you'll pay $80, there's potential for a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

You can get the product for $80 from John. Alice's offer is only $5 less than John's price, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
