"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get close to my desired price. I'm also framing it as a good deal for him, which might encourage him to accept.  I'm keeping the offer open for negotiation, but not too low as to risk going below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $13000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that amount by continuing negotiations. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I'm still hoping for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $13,000 is still below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm keeping the pressure on by rejecting Bob's offer, but also showing a willingness to compromise. I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hoping to find a meeting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for your product would be $13500. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to $15,000.  I still have some room to maneuver and don't want to settle for less than I can potentially get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm staying firm but showing willingness to compromise, meeting Bob halfway again. This demonstrates flexibility and might encourage him to accept."
