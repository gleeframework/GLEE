{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept his initial counteroffer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm not willing to take such a significant loss. At this point, it's better to sell the product to John for $15,000 and guarantee a good profit."
