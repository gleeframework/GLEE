Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage with Bob. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $19,000  leaves room for Bob to negotiate while staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  If Bob's counter-offer goes below $15,000, you are better off selling to John."
