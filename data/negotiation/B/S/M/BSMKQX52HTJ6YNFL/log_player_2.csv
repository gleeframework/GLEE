You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $900,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a price that's fair for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still a bit high. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

I'm going to counter with $860,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to meet her halfway, she'll be more open to reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to budge on her price. I've already made a few concessions and we're getting close to my limit.  It's time to cut my losses and purchase from John.  I'm not going to risk losing this opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
