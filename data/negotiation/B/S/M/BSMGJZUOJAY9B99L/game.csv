"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1175000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm still firm on my minimum price of $1200000.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. I'm not willing to go lower.  Let's see if we can close this deal. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1190000, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1190000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to worry we're not going to be able to reach a deal. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go any lower than $1200000. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work. If we can't agree, I'll be forced to consider other options.  ",1200000.0,Alice,7,
