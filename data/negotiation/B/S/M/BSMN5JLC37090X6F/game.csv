"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $109. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
