Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves a good amount of room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this offer will be attractive to Bob, given the product's value to him, but still allows for some bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway while still ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, and selling to John would be a significant financial loss."
