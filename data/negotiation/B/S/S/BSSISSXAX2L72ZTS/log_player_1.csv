Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $80.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
