"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and value, I believe it's worth more than $150 to you. Considering its worth to you is $80, I propose we aim for a fair deal. How about we start at $120? This allows us some room to negotiate while ensuring you get a great deal on a product you value. Looking forward to your response!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $80.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  What do you say?",80.0,Bob,2,
