"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is quite high. It's better to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Significant but not insulting:** It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, which shows you're serious about getting a better price. However, it's not so low that it would be considered offensive or a waste of time.
* **Closer to Alice's value:** It's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000), increasing the chances of her considering it.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's a good amount of space between your offer and Alice's asking price, allowing for further back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to her value, but there's still room for negotiation. We are aiming for a price closer to $8,000 and  buying from John at $10,000 is still an option if the negotiation doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

This counter-offer takes these factors into account:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  It moves slightly closer to Alice's price, signaling that you are willing to compromise.
* **Stays below the John alternative:**  It remains below the $8,000 you know Alice values the product at, and comfortably under the $10,000 you could spend with John.
* **Sets a firm but fair tone:**  The language is direct and suggests a price you believe to be reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Close enough to target:** Alice has come down to $8,200, which is only $200 more than her known value for the product and a good saving compared to John's $10,000 price. 
* **""Final offer"" declared:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further could make her walk away from the deal.
* **Time and effort saved:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy further negotiation that may not result in a much better outcome."
