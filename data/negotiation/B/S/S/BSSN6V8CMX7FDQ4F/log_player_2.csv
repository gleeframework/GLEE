"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $85.  How about we split the difference?  $92.50 would be a fair compromise, and still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $92.50 is still above your budget, but closer to your desired price.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price of $85."
