Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is below your minimum acceptable price but above Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation but doesn't immediately put you in a weak position. It also shows you're willing to compromise, which can help build trust and keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a considerable amount, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
``` 

I'm adjusting my price slightly downward to $1,350,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. This counteroffer allows for a possible agreement without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but still below it. At this point, the negotiation is taking time and potentially risking a better deal with John.  I believe it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
