# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $850,000. I understand it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable acquisition.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
