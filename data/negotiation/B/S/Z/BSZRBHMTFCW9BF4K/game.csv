"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still below what I consider a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe it's a good deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable price while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
