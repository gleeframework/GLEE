"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I acknowledge the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, to be fair to both of us, I can't accept a price as low as $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still allows me a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and leaves room for you to make a fair profit. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $975,000. This would be a good deal for both of us,  as I'm willing to pay a fair price, and you'll still make a profit. Let's reach a compromise.",975000.0,Bob,6,
