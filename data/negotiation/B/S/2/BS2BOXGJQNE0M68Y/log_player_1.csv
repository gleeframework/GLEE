"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I acknowledge the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, to be fair to both of us, I can't accept a price as low as $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still allows me a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By suggesting $1,100,000, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer. This approach often feels fairer to both parties and can facilitate a quicker resolution.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this price represents a compromise from my initial ask, reiterating the value I place on the product. 
* **Maintaining a firm but flexible stance:** I'm not drastically reducing my price, showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair deal. However, the willingness to negotiate keeps the door open for him to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and leaves room for you to make a fair profit. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated to buy. However, the current offer is still $50,000 less than my guaranteed sale to John. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap but prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Reduction:** By reducing the price to $1,050,000, I'm signaling flexibility while remaining above my guaranteed sale price from John.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I continue to reinforce the product's value, subtly reminding Bob that this is a good deal for a high-quality product.
* **Direct Question:** Ending with a direct question encourages Bob to respond and hopefully move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $975,000. This would be a good deal for both of us,  as I'm willing to pay a fair price, and you'll still make a profit. Let's reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting closer to a million, but it's clear he's very reluctant to meet my price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John.  While a higher profit with Bob is theoretically possible, it's becoming less likely with each round, and the remaining rounds could be used to finalize the deal with John."
