"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
This product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,300,000. That's a much higher price than its value to her, meaning there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I acknowledge the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, to be fair to both of us, I can't accept a price as low as $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still allows me a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget of $800,000.  I'll try to negotiate further to bring the price down closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and leaves room for you to make a fair profit. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,050,000 is still too high.  I'm determined to get the price down closer to my budget and will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $975,000. This would be a good deal for both of us,  as I'm willing to pay a fair price, and you'll still make a profit. Let's reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}
