Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I want to close this deal.  $13,500 is a bit too low for me, how about we split the difference and call it a deal at $14,250?"", ""product_price"": 14250}"

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, he's moving very slowly.  At this pace, even if we manage to get a slight increase over his last offer, it's unlikely to be significantly closer to John's standing offer of $15,000. Taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John makes more sense in this scenario than continuing to negotiate with Bob, where the potential upside is diminishing."
