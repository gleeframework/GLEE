"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  I'm confident this product has a lot of value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $712,500.  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",712500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $712,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $720,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",720000.0,Alice,5,
