"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $12,500?  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
