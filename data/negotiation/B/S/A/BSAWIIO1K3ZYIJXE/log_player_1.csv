Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to try and get closer to $1,000,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $975,000 is still too low for me, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
