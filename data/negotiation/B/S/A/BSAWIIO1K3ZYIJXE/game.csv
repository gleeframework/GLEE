"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it'll be equally valuable to you. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's discuss this further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm prepared to sell for $1,100,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again and offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
