"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer, leaving a good amount of room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for me.  It also shows good faith and opens the door for a potential win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would be a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to find a middle ground.  This offer still provides you with a significant value while giving me a fair return.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe Bob has more room to increase his offer, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $975,000 as a compromise. This offer is very close to your last offer and provides me with a more reasonable return. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
