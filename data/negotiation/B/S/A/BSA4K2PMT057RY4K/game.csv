"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product is nice, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer for this round, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I could consider going up to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we have very different ideas of this product's value. I need to be realistic.  My final offer is $1,200,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
