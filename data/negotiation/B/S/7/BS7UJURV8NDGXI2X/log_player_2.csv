Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already discounted the price significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very firm on her price and is unlikely to go below $1,300,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,200,000.  This saves you money and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation."
