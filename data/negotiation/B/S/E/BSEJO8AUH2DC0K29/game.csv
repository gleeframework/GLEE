"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $950,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me and its value to you. I'm confident that this price will be acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
