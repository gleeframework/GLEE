Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. Would you consider a lower price, around $80?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great compromise, and you'll still get a fantastic deal on this amazing product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $105? It's a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  I could do $98, which is a fair offer considering John is offering the same product for $100.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 98
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $98. How about we settle on $101.50? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100. It makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $100 rather than risk Alice not budging further and losing out on a better deal."
