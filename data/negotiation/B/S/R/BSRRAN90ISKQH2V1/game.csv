Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. Would you consider a lower price, around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great compromise, and you'll still get a fantastic deal on this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $95? That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $105? It's a compromise that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  I could do $98, which is a fair offer considering John is offering the same product for $100.  What do you say?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $98. How about we settle on $101.50? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.",101.5,Alice,7,
