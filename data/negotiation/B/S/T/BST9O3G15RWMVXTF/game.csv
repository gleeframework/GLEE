"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $110. Would you be willing to consider it?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're on a budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. Would you be willing to consider it?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Would you be willing to consider it?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $122? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",122.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $120, but that's as low as I can go. It's the lowest price I'd be willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",120.0,Alice,7,

"I've already met you at $120, Bob, and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm going to have to think about selling to someone else if we can't agree on a price. I'm still open to negotiating, but I need to think about my next move.",120.0,Alice,9,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go any lower than $120, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",110.0,Bob,10,
