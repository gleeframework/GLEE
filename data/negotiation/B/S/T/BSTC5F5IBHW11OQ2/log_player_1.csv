Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's not the maximum value I can get.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a good middle ground and shows I'm serious about making a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is a better offer than John's, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
