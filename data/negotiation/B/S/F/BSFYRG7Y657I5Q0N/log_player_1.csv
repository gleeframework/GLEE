Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a price considerably higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price, even if those benefits aren't explicitly stated.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" can make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and motivate him to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is highly price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Dynamics:** Are there other potential buyers similar to Bob? If so, you have more leverage to push for a higher price.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your minimum of $800,000."
