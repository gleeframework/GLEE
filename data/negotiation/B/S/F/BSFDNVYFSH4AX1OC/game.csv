Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than $8500. How about we settle on $9000? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
