"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you it's worth well over $1000000 to me. I'm willing to part with it for a starting price of $1500000. Please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique asset. However, based on my current assessment and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to propose an alternative that reflects a more reasonable valuation for both parties. My counteroffer is $900000. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is significantly below what I consider the true value of this asset.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000. This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects the value you've shown in the opportunity.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

Based on our discussions and my understanding of the market value, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $1100000. I hope this proposal will allow us to move forward with a transaction that respects the value of the asset while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
