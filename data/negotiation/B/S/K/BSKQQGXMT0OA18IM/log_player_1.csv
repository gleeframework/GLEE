Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique asset. However, based on my current assessment and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to propose an alternative that reflects a more reasonable valuation for both parties. My counteroffer is $900000. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects the value you've shown in the opportunity.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
