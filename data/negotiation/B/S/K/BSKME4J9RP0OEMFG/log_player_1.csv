Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

Here's why I structured the offer this way:

* **High Initial Offer:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both of you, starting high allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like a take-it-or-leave-it offer. This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, starting a negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you can adjust the tone and approach accordingly.
* **Market Information:** While John is a fallback, knowing if there are other potential buyers and their willingness to pay could change your strategy."
