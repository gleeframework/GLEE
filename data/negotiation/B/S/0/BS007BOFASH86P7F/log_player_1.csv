Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and keeps the conversation going. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know John will buy it for $12,000, Bob doesn't.  Don't get greedy and risk losing Bob entirely with an unreasonable initial offer.
* **Market Conditions:**  If similar products are selling for significantly less, you might need to adjust your price downwards. This information wasn't provided in the prompt."
