"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm starting the price at $20,000.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant discount and I'm confident it's a fair price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $13,000 is too low.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $15,000? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really not comfortable going above $13,000. That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
