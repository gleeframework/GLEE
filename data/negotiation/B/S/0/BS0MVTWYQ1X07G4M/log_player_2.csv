"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $150 from John, which is still within your budget of $150.  While Alice's offer is a better deal than John's, it's still not the best you can do. You have leverage in this situation, as you have another option."
