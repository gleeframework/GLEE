Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $135 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's getting close to my bottom line, but I'm not comfortable accepting it.  At this point, it's better for me to sell to John and get my desired price."
