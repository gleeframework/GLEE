"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. Can you consider this offer?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $135 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",130.0,Bob,6,
