"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $950,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. Let's try $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference at $1,037,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",1037500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,037,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1,050,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm adding to the product.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still hesitant about the $1,050,000 price. Let's see if we can finalize this. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 with the added warranty and support package. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already given you a lot of concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options, and I'm not sure I want to spend another round negotiating with you.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
