"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $950,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* It's still within your budget and allows for a good profit margin for Alice.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. Let's try $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference at $1,037,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1037500} 
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,037,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1,050,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm adding to the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still hesitant about the $1,050,000 price. Let's see if we can finalize this. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 with the added warranty and support package. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already given you a lot of concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options, and I'm not sure I want to spend another round negotiating with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is only $5,000 higher than your last counteroffer, and she's clearly nearing her bottom line.  
* You have one round left, and while you might be able to get a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great.
* Accepting this offer secures a good price within your budget, especially considering the added extras. 
* The negotiation has taken a significant amount of time, and continuing for one more round could lead to a stalemate or further delays."
