"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiating the price. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, I appreciate that. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $825,000 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
