Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($10,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $11,500 allows for a potential profit of $1,500 while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct, highlights value, and frames the price fairly.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$12,000 or higher:**  Bob likely won't pay his maximum perceived value. He has an incentive to negotiate or walk away.
* **$10,000 - $11,000:**  While guaranteed profit, it leaves potential money on the table. Bob might be willing to pay more."
