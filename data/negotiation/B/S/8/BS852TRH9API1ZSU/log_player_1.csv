"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.  I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming for the highest potential profit.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing my belief that the product is valuable to Bob, which could make him more interested in making a deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than my ideal price. I believe there's potential to get closer to my asking price with continued negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage and signals that I'm not desperate to sell. This could encourage Bob to come up with a higher offer in the next round. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** I have the option of selling to John for $800,000, which provides a floor for my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but still positions me with a price that's profitable for me.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing the justification for my price. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Target:**  $950,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $900,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower offer from Bob, especially since he seems to be firm on his price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's risky to risk losing time and potentially getting a lower price.  
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  I'm still above John's offer, so I'm in a good position."
