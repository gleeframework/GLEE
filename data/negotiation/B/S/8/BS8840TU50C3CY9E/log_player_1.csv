Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 allows space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price still significantly higher than your $800,000 backup offer.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product."
