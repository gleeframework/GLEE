"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a bit higher than what I was hoping to pay, but I'm interested in the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12500?  This would still be a great value for you, considering how much the product is worth to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $12500 is a good deal for me, considering I can get it from John for $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,4,
