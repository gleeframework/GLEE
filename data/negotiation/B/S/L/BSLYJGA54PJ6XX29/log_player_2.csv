This price reflects my commitment to ensuring you receive a high-quality solution while allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to serve you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you can see if she's open to negotiation."
