"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1200000. However, I'm willing to make a generous offer to you. I'll sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to market value.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your desire to sell and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
