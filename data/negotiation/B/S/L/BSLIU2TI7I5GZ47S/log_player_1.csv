Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $70? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have a budget to stick to.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your lowest acceptable price. There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from him, and John is already offering $80. It's time to take the sure thing and close the deal."
