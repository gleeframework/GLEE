"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a bit more than what it's worth to you, but I'm not willing to go above $8500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $9000. How about we say $9800? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9200, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9200, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to account for the value I've already offered. How about we say $9300? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for a deal that works for both of us.",9300.0,Alice,7,
