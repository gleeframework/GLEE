"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950,000. This is a significant discount considering the value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a fair deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you as well, so I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $750,000?  It seems like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to make a good profit. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
