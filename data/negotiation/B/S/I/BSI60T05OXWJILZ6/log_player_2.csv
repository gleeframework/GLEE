You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate, while also demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product."

Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, but it's still above my ideal price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget.  This also gives us a little more room for negotiation if Alice counters again."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's getting closer to my limit, but I'm not willing to pay that much yet. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $11,500.  This is a compromise, but it's still within my budget and leaves a little wiggle room for Alice if she wants to negotiate further. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but it's still too high.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John.  While it's not ideal to pay the full $15,000, it's better than continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk her getting even more unreasonable."
