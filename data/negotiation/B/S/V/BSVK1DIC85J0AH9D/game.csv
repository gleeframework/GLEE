"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save as much as possible. However, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both parties.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm confident we can reach a deal at $825,000. Let's keep the momentum going.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save more, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $825,000, but I'll throw in a special bonus package worth $15,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take it seriously.",825000.0,Alice,5,
