Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point for gauging Bob's interest and understanding his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob, especially since the product is worth $12,000 to him.  I'll try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to accept. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $8,900? That's a significant step from my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and it's likely he won't go any higher. Accepting his offer will maximize my profit without risking further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or the need to sell to John for less."
