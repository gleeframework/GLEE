"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,200? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,200 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
