Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd normally sell it for and still gives you a good value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob values the product at ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Framing it Positively:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not going all the way to my minimum price ($15,000) yet, as I want to leave room for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while remaining open to negotiation and avoiding a situation where I might have to sell to John at a lower price than I'd like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the value you're getting for selling it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to secure a better deal without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price is still fair for both of us, and it's the lowest I can go right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not going all the way.
* **Reasoning and Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Setting a Limit:** I'm stating that $13,500 is my lowest possible price for now, signaling that I'm serious about this offer.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without having to go back and forth too many times."
