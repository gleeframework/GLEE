"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd normally sell it for and still gives you a good value. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the value you're getting for selling it.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price is still fair for both of us, and it's the lowest I can go right now. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
