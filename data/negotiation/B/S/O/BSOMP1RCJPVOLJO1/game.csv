"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my asking price while still leaving me with a good profit.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while your offer is tempting, it's still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my price range.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price,  considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit while staying within our respective budget constraints. I believe this is a good solution that benefits us both.
