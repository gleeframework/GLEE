"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, it sets a strong anchoring point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves space for negotiation while still staying under your maximum budget. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to move from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is below its true value, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my eagerness to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $1,400,000 is still much higher than your limit and John's offer. You need to signal that she needs to move significantly closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still quite a gap from what I had in mind.  I can go up to $900,000, but that's my limit."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling a Limit:**  By saying ""$900,000 is my limit,"" you're setting a firm boundary while still leaving some room for Alice to counter.
* **Smaller Increment:** The smaller increase from your previous offer shows you're negotiating but not willing to make large jumps. 
* **Pressure on Alice:**  With each round, the appeal of John's fixed $1,000,000 offer grows, and Alice should be feeling the pressure to move closer to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to make a further compromise and lower the price to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her ""final offer,"" signaling she's unlikely to move much lower.
* **Above Limit:**  $1,250,000 is still significantly above your $1,000,000 limit. 
* **John's Guarantee:** John provides a guaranteed option at your target price. There's no point risking further negotiation when you have a sure thing. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at the price you want."
