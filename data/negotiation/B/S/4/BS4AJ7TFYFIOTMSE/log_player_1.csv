Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a special price of $14,500. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable, and this is a fantastic deal. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate if he wants, but still ensures you get a great price. 
* **Strong but Friendly Language:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value to Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance."
