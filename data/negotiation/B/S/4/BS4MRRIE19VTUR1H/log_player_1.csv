{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum acceptable price, but still gives you some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  It's also a price that is likely to pique Bob's interest, as it's lower than his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $10500 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you ideally want.  You have the leverage of John's offer, so you can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for me to make a profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10600 for your product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just $400 below your minimum acceptable price.  While you could try to squeeze out another $100 or so, the risk of losing the sale to Bob entirely and then having to settle for John's offer isn't worth it.  At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially sound decision."
