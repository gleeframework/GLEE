Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000), we create an anchor point that might make him view a subsequent counter-offer as more reasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. If he's truly interested, he might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than our minimum ($15,000).
* **Confidently highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to sway Bob's perception and justify the price.
* **Backup plan (John):** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's personality, you might adjust your approach."
