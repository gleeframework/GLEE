Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob.  
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob. If you want to be absolutely sure to sell the product, you could offer it to him at $10,001, guaranteeing a profit while still giving him a slightly better deal than John."
