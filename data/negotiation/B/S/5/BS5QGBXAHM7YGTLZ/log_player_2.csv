The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $160. It's not worth it to accept.  It's better to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

I'm offering Alice the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to her and $120 to me. If she rejects, I'll buy from John."

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above my maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also willing to walk away if necessary."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum value, and I've already made two counteroffers. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. It's better to buy the product from John at my target price."
