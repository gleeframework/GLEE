"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We know we can get it cheaper, either from Alice through negotiation or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a price point closer to the middle of our acceptable range ($80-$120) while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to our ideal price, we can still try to negotiate a bit further with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""It's getting closer!  How about $95 and we have a deal?"",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a price that works for us. This offer aims to strike a balance between getting a good deal and potentially closing the negotiation."
