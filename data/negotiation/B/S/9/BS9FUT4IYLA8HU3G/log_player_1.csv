Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $14,200, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly signaling that he's reaching his limit. Accepting $14,200 is a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away and having to settle for John's offer."
