Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find great value in it!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120. Offering it slightly below his valuation maximizes the chance of him accepting while securing almost all the potential profit. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you still secure a sale.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $119, just $1 below Bob's value, is less likely to be perceived as overly aggressive."
