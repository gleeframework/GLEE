Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is above your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also recognizes that the product is worth more to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.  We'll see how he responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for me to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $9,750. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a better price than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my counteroffer and it's getting closer to my desired price.  Since I'm happy with this offer, it makes sense to accept and finalize the deal."
