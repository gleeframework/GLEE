"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you can move to a better alternative."
