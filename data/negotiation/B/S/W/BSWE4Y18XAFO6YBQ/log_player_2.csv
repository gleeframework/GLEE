"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I'll sell the product to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still within my budget, and it's a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000."
