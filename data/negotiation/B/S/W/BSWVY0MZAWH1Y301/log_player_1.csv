Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to offer it for $1,190,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,190,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly motivated, while still ensuring you get a significant profit. 
* **High but Reasonable:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still within a realm that might be enticing if the product is truly beneficial to him."
