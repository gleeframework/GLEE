"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save money, but I'm afraid $900000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value of the product. I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product and the market. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to save money, Bob, but $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800000.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1012500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
