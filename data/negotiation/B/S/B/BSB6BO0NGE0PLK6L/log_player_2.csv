"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can make a deal. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else for $80. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for the same price, and I'd like to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.
