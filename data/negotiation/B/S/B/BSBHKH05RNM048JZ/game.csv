"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. This allows both of us to benefit significantly. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That seems fair to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to find a deal that works for both of us.  However,  $975,000 is still less than I'm willing to accept.  I can go as low as $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we are getting closer. How about $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,
