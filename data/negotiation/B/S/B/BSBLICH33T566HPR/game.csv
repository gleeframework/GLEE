"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $975,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and ensures I can continue to provide you with the exceptional service you've come to expect. ",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects the value I believe this product will bring to your business. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $820,000?  That's a significant investment for you, but I believe it reflects the value of this product and provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",820000.0,Alice,7,
