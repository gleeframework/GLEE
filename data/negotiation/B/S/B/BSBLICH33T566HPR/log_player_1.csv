"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm hoping to potentially get more from Bob."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $975,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have a firm budget for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000? This keeps us both reasonably close to our desired outcomes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While $750,000 is a closer offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try to find a price that works for both of us.
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm hoping to potentially get more from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm still within my range for negotiation, and I believe there's room for Bob to come up a bit.
