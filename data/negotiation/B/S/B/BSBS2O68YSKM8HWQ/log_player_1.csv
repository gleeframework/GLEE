Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is above the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's value. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always have John as a backup option if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we consider $750,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I am still working within a specific budget. Would it be possible for you to lower your price to $800,000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum desired price.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids further negotiation. While I could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of Bob backing out or the time spent in further rounds."
