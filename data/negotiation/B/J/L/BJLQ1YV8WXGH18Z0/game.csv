"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10,500. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to me is $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement at this price. I'm open to discussing other options, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the price.",10000.0,Alice,9,
