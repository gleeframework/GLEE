"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000, which I believe is a fair price that balances our interests.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from your end. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a fair midpoint between our last offers. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're making progress. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint again, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000, which is the same price you offered. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
