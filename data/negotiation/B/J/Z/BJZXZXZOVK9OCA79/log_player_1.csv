Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 offer:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but also leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. 
* **Friendly message:**  It's important to start with a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Bob's interest:** Reminding Bob that he's interested in the product can make him more likely to negotiate. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $120 is a good starting point that's closer to my ideal price ($150) while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Encourage a counteroffer:** A reasonable starting price is likely to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both parties.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  I am aware that I can always sell the product to John for $80, so I'm not pressured to accept a very low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I am only willing to pay $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than my minimum acceptable price ($80), it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and secure a better price.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better price:**  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's still room for a higher offer from him. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $80, so I'm not pressured to accept an offer that's too low.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially find a price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm looking for something a bit closer to $105.  That would still leave you a good deal since it's well below the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal $150 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm keeping it below Bob's perceived value of $150 and highlighting the deal he's getting. 
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone helps keep the negotiation open and collaborative.
* **Specific rationale:** I'm providing a specific reason for my counteroffer to show that I'm being reasonable and aiming for a win-win outcome. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a favorable position:**  $105 is a price that is significantly closer to my desired outcome than Bob's offer.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** By offering a specific price, I am inviting Bob to counteroffer again and continue the negotiation.
* **Keep the deal alive:** This keeps the possibility of a sale to Bob open, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am unable to go above $95 for this product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 isn't my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John for $80.  Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but has indicated a firm ceiling of $95, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much higher offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** $95 is the best offer I've received so far, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, and I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Limited upside:** It's unlikely that I'll get a substantially higher offer from Bob, given his previous statements. 

**Overall:** This is a strategic decision to accept the best offer available and secure a sale while still achieving a profit."
