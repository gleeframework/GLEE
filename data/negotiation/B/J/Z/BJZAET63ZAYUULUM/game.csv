"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full value for me.  I'm prepared to come down slightly, and offer a price of $1,125,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to move forward with this transaction. ",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,100,000.
