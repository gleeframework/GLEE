{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I believe is worth a lot to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  We begin with an offer of $15,000, which is higher than our minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives us room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Value proposition:** We include a brief message highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. This is important for creating a sense of urgency and making him consider the offer seriously.
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start a negotiation. 

This approach allows for flexibility. If Bob accepts, great! If not, we'll be ready to respond to his counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is our minimum acceptable price, we have room to potentially negotiate higher. Rejecting his offer allows us to:

* **Signal our value:**  By rejecting, we show that we believe the product is worth more than $12,000. 
* **Control the negotiation:** This gives us the opportunity to set the terms of the next counteroffer and guide the conversation. 
* **Explore a higher price:** We can use the next counteroffer to potentially push for a price closer to our initial $15,000. 

We will use the next round to craft a counteroffer that is closer to our desired price, but still within a range that Bob might consider."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is our minimum, I'm confident its true value is higher.  To show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still leaves some room for you to profit, and it's a fair price considering the unique benefits of this product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** We start by acknowledging his offer and expressing appreciation for his interest. 
* **Highlight potential value:** We reiterate our belief in the product's value, subtly reminding him of its unique benefits.
* **Compromise, but not too much:** We offer a price lower than our initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This shows flexibility while maintaining our desired margin. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** We frame the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the potential for both of us to benefit from the deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** We end with a question inviting Bob to continue the discussion. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while remaining firm on our belief that the product is worth more than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While we initially aimed for a higher price, Bob's latest offer of $12,800 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Considering the following:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  We can potentially push for a higher price in the next round. However, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further.
* **Time and effort:** Continued negotiation might take longer and may not necessarily lead to a significantly better outcome.
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If we reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might withdraw completely, and we'd be left with selling to John for only $12,000.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a secure sale at a price that's only slightly below our initial goal. This allows us to avoid the uncertainty and potential loss associated with further negotiation."
