Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price. This means a negotiated deal directly between you and Bob is impossible *unless* one or both of you are willing to make a concession.

**The Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor with John as Leverage:**  Offer the product to Bob at a price slightly below John's offer, using John's willingness to pay as leverage to potentially get Bob to budge closer to your minimum.

2. **Direct Sale to John:**  Recognize that Bob is not a viable buyer and proceed directly to selling to John.

**The Offer (Option 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I finalize a deal with another interested buyer.  Given the other party's enthusiasm, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,475,000. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The price is anchored just below John's offer, creating a sense of urgency and value.
* **Leverage:**  Mentioning another buyer (without revealing John's identity) adds pressure and legitimacy to your price.
* **Limited Time:** Creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If Bob is a skilled negotiator, he might call your bluff or try to negotiate you down further. 
* **Relationship Importance:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is crucial, you might choose to bypass this negotiation entirely and go directly to John.

**If Bob rejects this offer, proceed to sell the product to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.**"
