Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $140. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130 for you. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $130 is tempting, it's still over your budget. You've already made several counteroffers and it seems like Alice is not willing to go much lower.  John is offering a guaranteed price within your budget, so buying from John is the best option at this point."
