"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. $10,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
