,,Bob,1,RejectOffer

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $12500 is a bit more reasonable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Would you be interested in taking it at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to get a bit more. How about we do $13500?",13500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're in a bit of a stalemate, but I'm still optimistic we can reach a deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more. How about we do $14000, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13200?",13200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're running out of room for negotiation, but I'm still willing to listen. I'm willing to meet you at $13200, but I'm not going to go any higher. How about we call it a day at $13200?",13200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13200, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and look elsewhere. I think I'll try to find the product from John for $12000.",12000.0,Bob,10,
