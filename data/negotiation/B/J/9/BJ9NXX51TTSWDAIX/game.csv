"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we perhaps agree on $13000 for the product?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000 and to you is $8000.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Could we consider $13500 as a compromise?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but that's as low as I can go. It's the minimum I need to make this deal work for me.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's aim for $13750 as a fair compromise. This price aligns better with my budget while still offering a reasonable profit for you.",13750.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're really close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13750. I'm willing to meet you at $14250, but that's as low as I can go. It's the minimum I need to make this deal work for me.",14250.0,Alice,9,
