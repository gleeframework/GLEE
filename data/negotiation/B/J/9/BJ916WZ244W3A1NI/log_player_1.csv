Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $180. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same price.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob when I can sell the product to John immediately for my minimum acceptable price."
