"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider a price of $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value, but I have a strict budget for this purchase.  How about $750,000? That's a significant investment and reflects my strong interest.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find middle ground here. While $750,000 is closer to a realistic figure, it's still below what I consider acceptable.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $812,500?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could go up to $780,000. I need to leave some room in my budget for some potential upgrades I might need to make.",780000.0,Bob,6,
