You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

Alice's offer:

You're still closer to your goal of $8,000 with John.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further before committing."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still too low for me. To be honest, I'm getting closer to selling this to John for $15,000. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance.  I'll drop the price to $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.

While Alice is getting closer to your price, it's still $2,000 higher than what John is offering. It's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
