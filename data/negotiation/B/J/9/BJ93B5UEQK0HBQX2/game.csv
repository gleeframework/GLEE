"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a good price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still too low for me. To be honest, I'm getting closer to selling this to John for $15,000. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance.  I'll drop the price to $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
