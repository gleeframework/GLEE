"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'm aiming for a good margin.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping to get at least $150, and might even be able to squeeze out more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. It's a compromise, but still gives me a decent profit while being closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I don't want to risk losing the deal and getting stuck with the product. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
