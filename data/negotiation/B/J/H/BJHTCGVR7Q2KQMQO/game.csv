"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price considering the value you place on this product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
