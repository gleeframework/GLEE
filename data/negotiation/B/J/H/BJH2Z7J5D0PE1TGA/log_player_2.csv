"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price. There's no point in accepting the offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price, but he shouldn't accept anything above $1,000,000 at this point."
