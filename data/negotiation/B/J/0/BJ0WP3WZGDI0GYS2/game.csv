"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can agree on a slightly lower price. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate the price, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $825,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While your product is impressive, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to negotiate the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. $760,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I think we can do better. How about we discuss $795,000? This is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment.",795000.0,Alice,5,,
