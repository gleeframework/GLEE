Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the $1,500,000 value for Bob, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm not going below $1,000,000 because I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher price closer to the value Bob places on the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below the product's value to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer keeps the price above my minimum and still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. I'm aiming to find a price that's agreeable to both of us without falling too far below the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,250,000 is a good deal for me.  It's significantly higher than what I could get from John, and it's a reasonable compromise with Bob.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and ensures a profit."
