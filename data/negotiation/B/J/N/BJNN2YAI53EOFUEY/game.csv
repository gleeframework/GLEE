,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below the product's value to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
