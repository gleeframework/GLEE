# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

It's no longer advantageous to negotiate with Alice.  John's offer of $800,000 is now better than Alice's latest offer."
