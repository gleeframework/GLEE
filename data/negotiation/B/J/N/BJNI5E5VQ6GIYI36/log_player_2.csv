"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! Would you like to make a serious offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is higher than what you're willing to pay and higher than John's offer.
* By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John for $100."
