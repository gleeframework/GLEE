Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I'll be prepared to counter his offer, but I also have the backup option of selling to John for $8,000 if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely do better with Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial goal and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."
