"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is high quality, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but $8,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is the best I can do.",9200.0,Alice,5,
