Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110. It's worth more than that to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good starting point. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $110 leaves room for negotiation, as it's above Bob's value but below the price John is willing to pay.
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and suggests I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering. 
* **John is a safety net:**  I know John is willing to pay $100, so I'm not taking a significant risk by rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $95, which is halfway between my minimum price of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm still trying to maintain a friendly tone and suggest a win-win situation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to budge a bit closer to my desired price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  His latest offer of $85 is still below my minimum price of $100.
* **Time is money:**  This negotiation is taking longer than anticipated.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** I'm confident John is willing to pay $100, ensuring I get my minimum value and avoid further haggling with Bob.

By selling to John, I can secure the best possible outcome in this situation, maximizing my profit and saving time."
