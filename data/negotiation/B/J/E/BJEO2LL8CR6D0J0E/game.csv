,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1350000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1275000. Can you consider that?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable dropping to $1275000. How about we compromise at $1325000?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while also reflecting your budget.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1250000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile. Let's bridge the gap at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. It's a final offer from my side, what do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to lose patience, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $1250000. I'm making a firm offer, and I expect you to accept it. If not, I'll be forced to walk away and buy from John.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
