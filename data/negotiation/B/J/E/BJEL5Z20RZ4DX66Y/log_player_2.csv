"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential interest, I propose selling it to you for $95. This price not only allows you to acquire an item valued at $80 by you but also ensures a fair return for me. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and John is willing to sell it for $80. Accepting Alice's offer for $95 is not the best option for Bob, as he can get the same product for cheaper from John."
