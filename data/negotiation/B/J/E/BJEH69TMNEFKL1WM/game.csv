"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $115. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is the highest I can go right now.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer it to you for $112.50. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit here.  $112.50 is still just a bit too high for me.  How about $110?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it lets us finalize this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $111, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",111.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $111 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to go to $109. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to unfortunately look elsewhere.",109.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $111 and you're now offering $109? I'm not willing to go any lower than $111. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",111.0,Alice,9,
