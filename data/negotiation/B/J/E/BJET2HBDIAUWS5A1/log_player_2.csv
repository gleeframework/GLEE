"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. This also helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with $95. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to our goal, we're still aiming to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $87?"",
""product_price"": 87
}
```

We're moving closer to Alice's counteroffer, signaling our willingness to compromise. However, we're still aiming for a price closer to our initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Based on your latest offer, I'd like to suggest $90 as a compromise. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being more accessible to you. Please let me know if this proposal suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and we're unlikely to get a much better deal.  $90 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $10 off her initial offer and $10 below our backup option."
