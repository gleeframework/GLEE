"Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're serious about this product.  While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I could be persuaded to go down to $14,000. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still within my budget.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
