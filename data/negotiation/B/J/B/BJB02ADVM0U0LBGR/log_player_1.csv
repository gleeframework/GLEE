Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $8,000, so this is a good start.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to negotiate since he values the product higher.
* **It's not too aggressive:** You don't want to scare Bob away with an overly high initial price."
