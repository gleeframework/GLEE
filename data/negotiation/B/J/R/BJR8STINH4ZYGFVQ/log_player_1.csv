Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, while still ensuring you are well above your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit with Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
