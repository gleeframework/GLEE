Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product I think you might be interested in. I'm not going to give you any details just yet, but I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to the right person. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** This sets the bar high and gives you room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Intrigue and value emphasis:** Highlighting the uniqueness and worth of the product without revealing specifics creates curiosity and positions it as valuable.
* **Openness to discussion:**  The message indicates willingness to talk further, suggesting flexibility in price. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** Starting high allows for more negotiation room. 
* **Tests Bob's interest:** The high price will quickly reveal if Bob is a serious buyer.
* **Keeps options open:** The mention of John provides a safety net and reinforces your negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its uniqueness and potential value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $900000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the minimum value I've set for the product ($1,000,000).  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to gauge his seriousness and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's below what I can accept for this unique product.  However, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This would still be a significant value for you, and it's a price I can live with.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's budget:**  This shows I'm listening and trying to find a solution.
* **Meeting halfway:** This signals flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  ""Significant value"" reminds Bob of the product's worth and reinforces why the price is justified.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, allowing for potential adjustments. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a higher price:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates I'm open to negotiation, but not willing to drastically lower the price.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  This offer will reveal if Bob is serious about acquiring the product or just looking for a bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're closing in on a price that works for both of us. Considering my budget, I propose to purchase the product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** Accepting this offer secures a sale at a price significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Minimize risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to Bob withdrawing his offer entirely, leaving me with only John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting this offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and potentially a lengthy process."
