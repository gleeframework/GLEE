# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your specific needs. This exceptional item holds significant value for both of us, as it's worth $8,000 to you. I am extending this opportunity to you with an offer of $7,200. This price reflects my commitment to ensuring you receive the best possible value while maximizing the return on my investment. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, and we can proceed to finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,200 is less than your maximum budget of $8,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $800."
