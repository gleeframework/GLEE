Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where:

* **I'm maximizing my potential profit.** $14,000 is closer to my ideal price than John's offer. 
* **I'm leaving room for negotiation.**  Bob still has $1,000 of potential value to gain by accepting this offer.
* **I'm establishing a strong starting point.**  It communicates that I'm serious about getting a good price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable value.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to my minimum acceptable value.** $12,000 is my floor, and I'm willing to compromise a bit to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Shows that I'm still open to negotiation.**  I'm not just sticking to my original offer, but I'm also not letting Bob dictate the price.
* **Provides a clear next step.** I'm giving Bob a specific price to consider, making it easier for him to respond."
