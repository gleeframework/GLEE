"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. While  $600,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $700,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
