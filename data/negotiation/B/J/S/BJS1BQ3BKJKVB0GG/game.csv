"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,250? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer the product to you for $8,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",8750.0,Alice,5,
