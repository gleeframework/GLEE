"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $9,000.  This is not a good deal, so Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,250? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer the product to you for $8,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $8,750, which is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement and running out of rounds is high.  At this point, it's more strategic for Bob to buy from John for $8,000 to ensure he gets the product at his target price."
