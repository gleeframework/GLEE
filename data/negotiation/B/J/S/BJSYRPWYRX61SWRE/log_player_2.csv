"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,300,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. 
* Buying from John immediately would cost you more than buying from Alice even with a possible counter-offer."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $1,225,000 is still above my desired price range. 
* While it's closer to my budget, there's still room for negotiation. 
* I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* Buying from John immediately would be more expensive than negotiating with Alice further."
